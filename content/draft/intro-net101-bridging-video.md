# Video: Transparent Bridging Fundamentals

Years ago I wrote a series of blog posts comparing transparent bridging and IP routing, and creating [How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/Net101) materials seemed like a perfect opportunity to make that information more structured, starting with Transparent Bridging Fundamentals

# Video: IP Routing Fundamentals

Last time we covered transparent bridging fundamentals, now it's time to recap IP routing fundamentals... and then we'll be ready to compare the two.

# Video: Comparing Routing and Bridging

After covering the basics of transparent Ethernet bridging and IP routing, we're finally ready to compare the two. Enjoy the ride ;)

# Video: Typical Large-Scale Bridging Use Cases

In the previous video in the _[Switching, Routing and Bridging](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Net101#SWITCH)_ section of _[How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/Net101)_ webinar we compared transparent bridging with IP routing. Not surprisingly (given my well-known bias toward stable solutions) I recommended using IP routing as much as possible, but there are still people out there pushing large-scale transparent bridging solutions. 

In today's video we'll look at some of the supposed use cases and stable solutions you could use instead of stretching a virtual thick yellow halfway across a continent.
