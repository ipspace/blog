# (Pub) Video: Going Beneath the Surface

In order to demystify certain assumptions in regards to SD-WAN, [David Penaloza](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:David_Pe%C3%B1aloza_Seijas) began imparting the Cisco SD-WAN webinar series. Startning by providing real world experience beyond marketing hype and clearing misty messages around what can or cannot be done with them.

For that matter, the first video of the series focuses on going [beneath the surface](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/CiscoSDWAN/1%20-%20Going%20Beneath%20the%20Surface.mp4?doccode=CiscoSDWAN) of marketing and shiny corporate slides before discussing the solution's technical capabilities.

# (pub) Video: Cisco SD-WAN Onboarding Process

Once the architecture and routing capabilities are clear, [David Penaloza](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:David_Pe%C3%B1aloza_Seijas) describes the [onboarding process](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/CiscoSDWAN/5%20-%20Onboarding%20Process.mp4?doccode=CiscoSDWAN) and tasks performed by the solution - like encryption, tunnel establishment and device onboarding - in it's so-called Orchestration Plane.

# (pub) Video: Cisco SD-WAN Policies and Centralized Magic

Right after devices are onboarded, how are the control and data plane tasks determined? In this section, [David Penaloza](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:David_Pe%C3%B1aloza_Seijas) covers how the solution makes the most of its SDN nature: single point of [policy application and centralized management platform](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/CiscoSDWAN/6%20-%20Policies%20and%20Centralized%20Magic.mp4?doccode=CiscoSDWAN). The types of policies, the plane on which they act, their application and the actions that can performed are the main focus in this part of the series.

# (Pub) Video: Cisco SD-WAN Policies Review

The second part of the series focuses on design considerations and trade-offs in several scenarios. [David Penaloza](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:David_Pe%C3%B1aloza_Seijas) briefly reviews the [types of policies and their capabilities](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/CiscoSDWAN/7%20-%20Policies%20review.mp4?doccode=CiscoSDWAN) before discussing what to keep in mind when designing the solution.

# Video: Cisco SD-WAN Routing Design

After reviewing policies, its time to dig into the routing design. In this section, [David Penaloza](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:David_Pe%C3%B1aloza_Seijas) enumerates several possible topologies, types of transport, their advantages and drawbacks, considerations for tunnel count and regional presence, and what you should consider beforehand when [designing the solution from the control plane's perspective](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/CiscoSDWAN/8.1%20-%20Routing%20Design.mp4?doccode=CiscoSDWAN).

# Video: Cisco SD-WAN Site Design

There are some advantages you can make the most of when designing a site in Cisco SD-WAN. [David Penaloza](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:David_Pe%C3%B1aloza_Seijas) briefly explains some of those [capabilities](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/CiscoSDWAN/8.2%20-%20Site%20Design.mp4?doccode=CiscoSDWAN), like extending transports between nodes or HA between them. How are the transports used and how to track an Internet-facing interface and a service beyond its next hop.

# Video: Cisco SD-WAN Policy Design

The last section of the series places the policies in the spotlight. [David Penaloza](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:David_Pe%C3%B1aloza_Seijas) brings up considerations in regards to site ID assignments and policy processing order. A carefully planned site scheme and ordered list of policy entries will save you complications in a non-distant future when bringing up the solution. As each site is the minimal policy application element, their importance when [designign policies](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/CiscoSDWAN/8.3%20-%20Policy%20Design.mp4?doccode=CiscoSDWAN) cannot be understated.
