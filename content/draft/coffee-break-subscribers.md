title: ipSpace.net Coffee Break - no changes for subscribers and course attendees
---
Hi,

Tomorrow we'll announce our plans for an extended coffee break starting on June 24th 2021 on ipSpace.net blog. The draft (in markdown format) [is here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uuqot5gdg2ljccs/planning-coffee-break.md?dl=0) in case you're too curious to wait for another day ;), but I didn't want you to hear about the news on our blog, so here we are.

**Long story super-short**: nothing much will change for you.

If you're an active subscriber, you'll get 12 months worth of new content... just not in a year. I will keep extending your subscription (obviously for free) for as long as needed.

There are also no significant changes planned for course attendees. We're changing our help-and-support policy starting with the public cloud course in May 2021 (assuming we get enough good ideas from potential guest speakers) that will limit the support and hands-on exercise review to 12 months after the registration, which (worst case) still gives you at least 15 months to complete your studies.

Regardless of that, our Slack workspace (or whatever it's called) will remain active as long as there will be a free version of Slack, and I will do my best to help you and review your solutions... it's just that it might take me a while longer than what you're used to.

Nothing else is planned to change in 2021 (but then if we've learned anything from the 2020 debacle it's that plans change beyond our wildest imaginations), and I'll make sure to warn you of anything that might have an impact months in advance.

Last but definitely not least, I wish you all the best in 2021!
Ivan
