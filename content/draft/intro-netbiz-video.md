# (Pub) Video: Define the Problem Before Searching for a Solution

In December 2019 I finally turned my _[focus on business challenges first](https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/12/focus-on-your-business-not-fancy.html)_ presentation into a short webinar session (part of _[Business Aspects of Networking Technologies](https://www.ipspace.net/Business_Aspects_of_Networking_Technologies)_ webinar) starting with _defining the problem before searching for a solution_ including three simple questions:

* What BUSINESS problem are you trying to solve?
* Are there good-enough alternatives or should you really invest into new technology and/or equipment?
* Is the problem worth solving?

# (Pub) Video: Know Your Users' Needs

After explaining why you should focus on defining the problem before searching for a magic technology that will solve it, I continued the _[Focus on Business Challenges First](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetBiz#BF)_ presentation with another  set of seemingly simple questions:

* Who are your users/customers?
* What do they really need?
* Assuming you're a service provider, what are you able to sell to your customers... and how are you different from your competitors?

# (Pub) Video: Should You Build or Buy a Solution?

After _figuring out what business problem you're trying to solve_ and _what the users expect to get from you_ it's time for the next crucial question: should you buy a shrink-wrapped product/solution or build your own?

{{<note info>}}The same dilemma [applies to network automation solutions](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutSol&module=1#M1S3).{{</note>}}

I addressed that question in the third part of _[Focus on Business Challenges First](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetBiz#BF)_ presentation.

# (Pub) Video: High-Level Technology Guidelines

I concluded the _[Focus on Business Challenges First](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetBiz#BF)_ presentation (part of _[Business Aspects of Networking Technologies](https://www.ipspace.net/Business_Aspects_of_Networking_Technologies)_ webinar) with a few technology guidelines starting with:

* Be vendor-agnostic (always look around to see what others are doing);
* Try to understand how the technology you're evaluating really works (it will help you spot the potential problems before they crash your network);
* Always select what's best for your business, not for the sales quota of your friendly $vendor account manager.
