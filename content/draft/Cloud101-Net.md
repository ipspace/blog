# (Pub) Video: We Still Need Networking in Public Clouds

Whenever someone starts mansplaining that you we need no networking when we move the workloads into a public cloud, please walk away -- he has just proved how clueless he is. 

He might be a tiny bit correct when talking about software-as-a-service (after all, it's just someone else's web site), but when it comes to complex infrastructure virtual networks, there's plenty of networking involved, from packet filters and subnets to NAT, load balancers, firewalls, BGP and IPsec.

For more details, watch the "We Still Need Networking in Public Clouds" video (part of [Introduction to Cloud Computing](https://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Cloud_Computing) webinar).

# (Pub) Video: Public Cloud Networking Is Different

Even though you need plenty of traditional networking constructs to deploy a complex application stack in a public cloud (packet filters, firewalls, load balancers, VPN, BGP... more details here), once you start digging deep into the bowels of public cloud virtual networking, you'll find out it's significantly different from the traditional Ethernet+IP implementations common in enterprise data centers.

For an overview of the differences watch the "Public Cloud Networking Is Different" video (part of [Introduction to Cloud Computing](https://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Cloud_Computing) webinar), for more details start with AWS Networking 101 and Azure Networking 101 blog post, and continue with corresponding cloud networking webinars.

# (Pub) Video: How Can You Master Public Cloud Networking?

By now I'm hoping you've realized there's still need for networking in public clouds, and mastering it requires slightly different set of skills. What could you as a networking engineer to get fluent in this different world? I collected a few hints in the last video in *Introduction to Public Cloud Networking* series.
