# (Pub) Video: Introduction to Network Addressing

A friend of mine pointed out [this quote by John Shoch](https://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien19.txt) when I started preparing the [Network Stack Addressing slide deck](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/Network%20Stack%20Addressing.pdf?doccode=Net101) for my [How Networks Really Work webinar](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work):

> The *name* of a resource indicates **what** we seek, an *address* indicates **where** it is, and a *route* tells us **how to get there**.

You might wonder when that document was written... it was in January 1978. They got it absolutely right 42 years ago, and we completely messed it up in the meantime with the crazy ideas of making IP addresses resource identifiers.

Imagine that you'd be identified by the street address at which you were born, and had to carry that address around (and update Google Maps) every time you decided to travel. How crazy is that... and yet that's exactly how [some application developers love to think of the world our servers live](https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/11/typical-enterprise-application.html) in, and what virtualization vendors managed to persuade sysadmins makes perfect sense. No wonder [networking is as complex as it can get](https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/this-is-what-makes-networking-so-complex.html) before [collapsing in a smoldering pile of kludges](https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/10/disaster-recovery-faking-take-two.html).

# (Pub) Video: Theoretical View of Network Addressing

After explaining the basics of (network) names, addresses and routes, I [wasted a few minutes of everyone's time discussing the theoretical aspects of layered addressing](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/NA1.2%20-%20Theoretical%20View%20of%20Network%20Addressing.mp4?doccode=Net101), and then got back to practical issues like address scopes, namespaces, and address provisioning, concluding with a simple (and unappreciated) truth - if you have a point-to-point cable between two nodes you don't need data-link-layer addresses. The consequences of that fact are left as an exercise for the viewer (or you can wait till the next video ;)

# (Pub) Video: Early Data-Link-Layer Addressing

After a brief coverage of the theoretical aspects of network addressing, I [described early data-link-layer addressing solutions](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/NA2.1%20-%20Early%20Data%20Link%20Layer%20Addressing%20Mechanisms.mp4?doccode=Net101), including _one address per message_ (SDLC, HDLC) and _ignore this address_ (PPP) to _no address on P2P links_ (SLIP).

# (Pub) Video: Local Area Network Addressing

In the _[Local Area Network Addressing](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/NA2.2%20-%20Local%20Area%20Network%20Addressing.mp4?doccode=Net101)_ video (part of _[How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work)_ webinar) I covered numerous obscure LAN addressing details including:

* There's no layer-2 address in Fibre Channel frames (because [FC is routing not bridging](https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/07/is-fibre-channel-switching-bridging-or.html));
* Why is the multicast bit lowest bit (0x01) in first byte on Ethernet but highest bit (0x80) on Token Ring or FDDI;
* How some NIC manufacturers never got the memo on what OUI really means.

# Video: Network Layer Addressing

After a brief excursion into the ancient data link layer addressing ideas (that you can still find in numerous systems today) and LAN addressing it's time to focus on network-layer addressing, starting with "_can we design protocols without network-layer addresses_" (unfortunately, YES) and "_should a network-layer address be tied to a node or to an interface_" (as always, _it depends_).

For more details, watch the [Network Layer Addressing](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/NA3.1%20-%20Network%20Layer%20Addressing.mp4?doccode=Net101) video (part of _[How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work)_ webinar).

# Video: Comparing TCP/IP and CLNP

If you were building networks in early 1990s you probably remember at least a half-dozen different network protocols. Only one of them survived (IPv6 came later), with another one (CLNP) providing an interesting view into a totally different parallel universe that evolved using a different set of fundamental principles.

After introducing the network-layer addressing, I [compared the two and pointed out where one or the other was clearly better](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/NA3.2%20-%20Comparing%20IP%20and%20CLNP%20Addressing.mp4?doccode=Net101). 

You might think that it makes no sense to talk about protocols that were rarely used in old days, and that are almost non-existent today, but as always _those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it_, this time reinventing CLNP principles in [IPv6-based](https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/09/coming-full-circle-on-ipv6-address.html) [layer-3-only data center fabrics](https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/05/reinventing-clns-with-l3-only-forwarding.html).

# Video: Combining Data-Link- and Network Layer Addresses

In the previous videos in the _[How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work)_ webinar I described some interesting details of data-link layer addresses and network layer addresses. Now for the final bit: how do we map an adjacent network address into a per-interface data link layer address? 

If you answered ARP (or ND if you happen to be of IPv6 persuasion) you're absolutely right... but is that the only way? Watch the _[Combining Data-Link- and Network Addresses](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/NA3.3%20-%20Combining%20Data-Link%20and%20Network%20Addresses.mp4?doccode=Net101)_ video to find out.

# Video: Network Address Scopes

When defining network addresses in [IEN 19](https://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien19.txt) John Shoch said:

> Addresses must, therefore, be meaningful throughout the domain, and must be drawn from some uniform address space.

But what is a domain? Welcome to the address scope discussion ;)

# Video: Network Address Translation

Remember the [IEN 19](https://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien19.txt) quote I used to introduce address scopes?

> Addresses must, therefore, be meaningful throughout the domain, and must be drawn from some uniform address space.

These days we often connect networks using organization-wide (RFC1918) IPv4 addresses with networks using global IPv4 addresses (the Internet) - clearly the case of connecting two network domains.

As always, there's a right and a wrong way to do that. The right way would be to connect the two domains above network layer - a transport- or application-layer proxy server. The wrong way is a monstrosity known as Network Address Translation, and of course I covered it in _[How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work)_ webinar... and couldn't avoid the question [whether NAT is a security feature](https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/12/is-nat-security-feature.html) (hint: still NO).
