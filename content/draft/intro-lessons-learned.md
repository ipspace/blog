### Lessons Learned: Technology Still Matters

In June 2020, a friend of mine asked me to do a short presentation on lessons learned during my 35 years of being a networking engineer. It went reasonably well, so I decided to turn it into a webinar, starting with "regardless of what the disruptive marketers tell you, technology still matters."

### Lessons Learned: Fundamentals Haven't Changed

Here's another bitter pill to swallow if you desperately want to believe in the magic powers of unicorn dust: laws of physics and networking fundamentals haven't changed (see also: RFC 1925 Rule 11). Whenever someone is promises a miracle solution, it's probably due to them working in marketing or having no clue what they're talking about (or both)... or it might be another case of adding another layer of abstraction and pretending the problems disappeared because you can't see them anymore.

### Lessons Learned: Complexity Will Kill Your System

You wouldn't believe the intricate network designs I created decades ago until I learned that having an uninterrupted sleep is worth more than proving I can get the impossible to work (see also: [using EBGP instead of IGP in a 4-node data center fabric](https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/11/bgp-as-better-igp-when-and-where.html)). 

Once I started valuing my free time, I tried to design things to be as simple as possible. However, as my friend Nicola Modena said, "*Consultants must propose new technologies because they must be seen as bringing innovation,*" and we all know complexity sells. Go figure.

### Lesson Learned: Some Services Are Not Worth Delivering

Here's one of the secrets to AWS's unprecedented scale and financial success: they figured out very early on that some services are not worth delivering. Most everyone else believes in building snowflake single-customer solutions to solve imaginary problems, effectively losing money while doing so.

### Lesson Learned: The Way Forward

I tried to wrap up my Lessons Learned presentation on a positive note: what are some of the things you can do to avoid all the traps and pitfalls I encountered:

* Get invited to architecture and design meetings when a new application project is starting.
* Always try to figure out what the underlying actual business needs are.
* Just because you can doesn't mean that you should.
* Keep it as simple as possible, but no simpler.
* Work with your peers, and explain how networking works and why you're facing certain limitations.
* Humans are not perfect -- automate as much as it makes sense but no more.
