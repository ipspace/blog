Contrary to what some evangelists would love you to believe, getting fluent in network automation is a bit harder than watching 3-minute videos and cobbling playbooks together with [google-and-paste](https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/03/dunning-kruger-in-it-infrastructure.html)… but then nothing really worth doing is ever easy, or everyone else would be doing it already.

Here’s a typical comment from a [Building Network Automation Solutions](https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions) attendee:

> I'm loving the class. I feel more confused than I ever have in my 23 year career… but I can already see the difference in my perspective shift in all aspects of my work.

You’ll find another one along the same lines in the course description:

> A chain reaction took place in my head. I'm down to earth now and I'm busy with my first Ansible project - automating deployment of an EoMPLS service.

Remember the days you were studying for your CCIE (or CCNP)? Now imagine doing that in an unfamiliar territory ;)

Remember how satisfying it was to push through a really tough challenge and get it working (see also: [The Deep Benefits of Learning Hard Things](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2020/03/29/the-deep-benefits-of-learning-hard-things/))? There are a dozen hard challenges waiting for you in the *hands-on exercises* part of the course.
