## (Pub) Updated: What is Cumulus Linux All About

[Pete Lumbis](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Pete_Lumbis) started his [Cumulus Linux 4.0 update](https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics#Update_Sessions) with an overview of differences between Cumulus Linux on hardware switches and Cumulus VX, and continued with an in-depth list of ASIC families supported by Cumulus Linux.

You can watch his presentation, as well as the more in-depth overview of Cumulus Linux concepts by Dinesh Dutt, in the recently-updated [What Is Cumulus Linux All About](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/DCFabric/M80%20-%20What%20Is%20Cumulus%20Linux%20All%20About.mp4?doccode=DCFabric) video.

## (Pub) Video: Simplify Device Configurations with Cumulus Linux

The designers of Cumulus Linux CLI were always focused on simplifying network device configurations. One of the first features along these lines was [BGP across unnumbered interfaces](https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/02/bgp-configuration-made-simple-with.html), then they introduced simplified EVPN configurations, and recently [auto-MLAG and auto-BGP](https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/10/auto-mlag-and-auto-bgp-in-cumulus-linux.html).

You can watch a short description of these features by [Dinesh Dutt](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Dinesh_Dutt) and [Pete Lumbis](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Pete_Lumbis) in [Simplify Network Configuration with Cumulus Linux](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/DCFabric/M83%20-%20Simplify%20Network%20Configuration%20with%20Cumulus%20Linux.mp4?doccode=DCFabric) and [Smart Datacenter Defaults](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/DCFabric/M83A%20-%20Smart%20Datacenter%20Defaults.mp4?doccode=DCFabric) videos (part of [Cumulus Linux](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DCFabric#CUMULUS) section of [Data Center Fabrics](https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics) webinar).

## Video: NetQ and Cumulus Linux Data Models

In the last part of his [Cumulus Linux 4.0 Update](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DCFabric#CUMULUS) [Pete Lumbis](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Pete_Lumbis) talked about using NetQ to capture streaming telemetry and increase network observability, and the new model-driven configuration approach (including all the usual buzzwords like NETCONF, RPC, YAML, JSON, and OpenConfig) coming in 2020.
