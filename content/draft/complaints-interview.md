Unfortunately in my experience companies donâ€™t show much respect to people with knowledge of fundamentals. Usually the common theme is do it fast and under budget so that managers look great and most importantly forget quality of work.

I've been a network engineer for a good number of years now and would like to share my experience with hardest part, "how do I get experience".

I worked for a company (not network engineer) and I was studying CCNA. I went upstairs and found the NOC manager and told them I was studying and wanted to be a network engineer. I asked if I could come up and meet the team and shoulder a few of the guys, learn what they did. 

A vacancy came up eventually and I got the job. I don't think it was because I was good, I wasn't.. I sucked. But I put myself ahead of the "identical CVs" by showing my face and my interest. 

I was so scared before doing it (I'm quite shy) but I'm so glad I did. My fear of rejection was my biggest barrier, not my capabilities or knowledge. Learning is the easy bit.

Best of luck for anyone attempting to get into networking, we need you.. Good engineers are hard to find :)

I didn't agree with everything he said because I'm from Brazil and the market is different depending on the country you're looking for experience, but he said some essential in the final "pay the bills and learn the fundamentals"

The dark truth about networking in the business is that they just want something to do the basic to intermediate level networking to work for them, in most cases the engineers in my office are also capable to do such that because other engineers have more flexible time to learn other skills from any source available or do things that they're interested in especially tech related stuff even without any cert in those fields, they just can and networking is not like a software its much easier to setup maintain and troubleshoot without too much pain work. Also there's a job now called IT support which cover lots of networking science in it so maybe company just want to hire them bcs its cheaper than network engineer and get the job done.

Now I understand why I didn't like his articles, they are written in the same obscure way, like this interview.
