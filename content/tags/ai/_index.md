Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are the next big hype in networking following Software-Defined Everything and Intent-Based Everything. Like with the previous hype bubbles it's worth figuring out

* How much of the hype is real (TL&DR: not much)?
* Whether the technology is ready to be used in production networks (TL&DR: some of it)
* How you could use the technology to make your life easier

### {{<plushy confused>}}How Real Is It?

Like with the previous hype tsunamis I'll do my best to help you figure out the answers to the above questions with a hefty dose of skepticism and snark[^WTL], starting with:

[^WTL]: Please don't blame me for pointing out the ever-lasting validity of [Sturgeon's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law). Contrary to what some people think, I'm not trying hard to pick up dismal examples of AI failures, I'm just good at looking in the wrong places.

### {{<plushy magic>}}AI/ML in Networking: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

[Javier Antich](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Javier_Antich) created a wonderful _[AI/ML in Networking](https://www.ipspace.net/AI_and_ML_in_Networking)_ in 2021. If you know nothing about AI/ML and wonder whether you should care about it, you MUST watch these videos from his webinar:

In 2023, Javier [published a book covering the same set of topics in way more details](/2023/02/machine-learning-network-cloud.html). I would highly recommend you read it if you want to know more.

### {{<plushy master>}}What Others Are Saying

I keep collecting interesting articles talking about AI in general and (lately) ChatGPT. I found these interesting enough to mention them in _worth reading_ blog posts:
