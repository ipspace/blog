<div class="bloggerBody"><p>Thanks to my readers, I often learn something completely new about the intricacies of Cisco IOS. The “<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/07/quick-tip-vlan-interface-status.html">VLAN Interface Status</a>”<em> </em>post resulted in a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/07/quick-tip-vlan-interface-status.html">comment about the <em>SVI autostate</em></a><em> </em>concept, which is (not surprisingly) a somewhat muddy topic:</p>
<ul class="Bullet1"><li>In most cases, the SVI interface tracks the state of access <em>and</em> trunk ports using the VLAN. The details are well explained in the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/12.2/37sg/configuration/guides/l3_int.html"><em>Understanding SVI Autostate</em></a> section of the Cisco IOS documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">The important part of the SVI autostate calculation is the “port is in STP forwarding state for the VLAN” requirement. If a VLAN is not carried in a trunk port (for example, due to <strong>switchport trunk allowed</strong> configuration command), the trunk port’s status does not influence the autostate.</p>
<ul class="Bullet1"><li>In some IOS releases, you can exclude the individual physical ports from the autostate calculation with the <strong>switchport autostate exclude </strong>interface configuration command. Most commonly you’d want to exclude uplink ports on access switches.</li>
<li>In some unspecified IOS releases (including 12.4T), you can use the (currently undocumented according to Command Lookup Tool) <strong>no autostate </strong>VLAN interface configuration command, which disables the <em>autostate</em> algorithm and makes the SVI interface permanently active.</li>
</ul>
