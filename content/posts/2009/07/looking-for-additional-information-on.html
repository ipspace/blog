<p>I'm looking for details on how Netflix streams videos over the Internet. I've <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2008/11/encoding-for-streaming.html">found their description of encoding and bit rates</a>, but was not able to find lower-layer details (I can only assume they use UDP, but I would like to verify that with someone who's actually using the service).</p>
<p>I would also appreciate any information on whether they work with Service Providers (for example, using local direct peering) to ensure the upstream Internet connections are not clogged with streamed video.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your responses!<br/>Ivan</p>
