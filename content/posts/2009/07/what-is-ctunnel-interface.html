<div class="bloggerBody"><p>You might have noticed that your IOS release supports a <em>ctunnel </em>interface (hint: your image has to support CLNS) and wondered what it could do. Well, it’s a GRE tunnel between a pair of NSAPs, so you can transport IP traffic across your well-engineered CLNS network without ever exposing the core routers to the dangers of IP.</p>
<p>But wait, it gets better: starting with IOS releases 12.3(7)T and 12.2(33)SRA, you can <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t7/feature/guide/gtclnsv6.html">transport IPv6 across the <em>ctunnel </em>interface</a>. Unfortunately, they haven’t implemented MPLS over GRE over CLNS yet (the <strong>mpls ip </strong>command is present, but does not work).</p>
<p class="more">It looks like there's at least one potentially <a href="http://acast.grc.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/icns/2004/11_session_c3/C3-06-Descaillot.pdf">very large-scale application</a> that could use this feature.</p>
