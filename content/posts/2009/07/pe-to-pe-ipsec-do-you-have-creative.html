<div class="bloggerBody"><p>Ying would like to have a PE-to-PE IPSec protection for traffic within a single VRF. For example, all traffic in VRF-A sent between PE-1 and PE-2 should be protected with IPSec and the PE-routers should be the endpoints of the IPSec session (CE-to-CE IPSec is trivial).</p>

<p>My first response was “hard to do”, then I started hallucinating about MPLS-over-GRE-over-IPSec-over-IP-over-MPLS tunnels between the PE-routers with tunnel-specific IGP and per-VRF BGP next hops. It can be done (we’ve implemented numerous large-scale MPLS/GRE/IPSec designs), but is there a simpler alternative? Please share your ideas in the comments.</p>
