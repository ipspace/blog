<div class="bloggerBody"><p>According to <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">FeedBurner</a> statistics, my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/feeds/posts/default">RSS feed</a> had exactly 5000 subscribes on June 30<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The Feedburner subscriber count is a notoriously unreliable measure, as it <a href="http://www.google.com/support/feedburner/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=78955">tries to estimate the actual number of subscribers for on-line services</a> that cache the feeds (for example, Google Reader) â€¦ but the result is nonetheless quite nice.</p>
