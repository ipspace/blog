<div class="bloggerBody"><p>Vijay sent me this question a while ago:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I have configured a L3 VLAN interface on a Cisco 3750 switch and assigned an IP address to it. I haven't assigned any ports to this VLAN. Why am I not able to ping the IP address of the VLAN interface from the switch itself?</blockquote>
<p>The VLAN interface (like any other interface) has layer-1 and layer-2 state.</p>
<p class="note">The layer-1 state is displayed in the <em>Status </em>column of the <strong>show ip interface brief </strong>command, the layer-2 state in the <em>Protocol </em>column.</p>
<p>A VLAN interface is always up, but its <em>line protocol</em> state tracks the state of attached ports: if at least one port is operational, the <em>line protocol </em>of the VLAN interface is <em>up</em>, otherwise it’s <em>down</em>. With no ports assigned to a VLAN, the <em>line protocol </em>of the VLAN interface is down, its IP address is not in the IP routing table and thus you cannot <strong>ping</strong> it.</p>
