<div class="bloggerBody"><p>I’m switching to the “traditional” summer schedule: until mid-August, I’ll post two to three shorter articles per week. I don’t want to spend too much of my vacation time writing, but I also don’t want to see you bored with dormant blogosphere.</p>
<p>Some of my projects will simply have to wait for the temperatures to drop, including a few selected Service Provider issues I’ve started writing about in the last weeks and the ADSL QoS topics (don’t worry, I haven’t forgotten them).</p>
</div>
