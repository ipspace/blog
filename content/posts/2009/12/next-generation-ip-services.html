title: Next-generation IP services

<p>A while ago I’ve created a short presentation describing modern IP- and web-based services. It describes the application-layer topics I’ve been focusing on in the last few years, from cloud computing to web-based applications. I've tried to keep it simple enough that someone without the prior knowledge of the field would not get lost after two slides, but still far away from high-level marketing nonsense (you can get plenty of that anywhere else). Today I finally found some time to spend on the paperwork and wrote the description of the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Next-generation_IP_services"><em>Next-generation IP Services </em>tutorial</a>.</p>
