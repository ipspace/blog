<p>I’m planning to deliver my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Category:Workshop">workshops/tutorials</a> as web-based sessions in the next year. One of the very important aspects (apart from having good content at a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/12/let-me-help-you-with-your-budget.html">reasonable price</a>) is the timing: I’m trying to adapt to the preferences of as many potential visitors as possible. </p>
<p>Could you help me figure out what the best time would be? Let me know what works for you by participating in this poll (but please do so only if you plan to attend one of the sessions).</p>
