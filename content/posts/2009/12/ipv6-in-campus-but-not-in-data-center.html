title: IPv6 in the campus but not in the Data Center?

<p>Cisco has recently published two excellent design guides: <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Campus/CampIPv6.html">Deploying IPv6 in Campus Networks</a> and <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Branch/BrchIPv6.html">Deploying IPv6 in Branch Networks</a>. As expected from the engineers writing Cisco’s design documents, these guides contain tons of useful information and good recommendations; they’re a highly recommended reading if you’ve started considering IPv6 deployment in your enterprise network. These design guides are part of <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns816/networking_solutions_program_home.html">Design Zone for Branch</a> and <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns815/networking_solutions_program_home.html">Design Zone for Campus</a>.</p>
<p class="more">IPv6 deployment issues are just one of the topics covered in the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Enterprise_IPv6_Deployment_Workshop"><em>Enterprise IPv6 Deployment</em> workshop</a>. You can attend an online version of the workshop or we can organize a dedicated event for your team.</p>
<!--more--><p><a href="/2009/11/ipv6-in-data-center-is-cisco-ready/">As expected</a>, there’s no IPv6 section in the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns743/networking_solutions_program_home.html">Design Zone for Data Centers</a>. The “ipv6” does not even appear in the latest <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/ns340/ns414/ns742/ns743/ns758/networking_solutions_products_genericcontent0900aecd806c3a8c.pdf">Cisco Data Center Assurance Program</a>. It looks like we’re dealing with multiple companies: the routing-and-switching company that understands where the world is heading and works hard to prepare itself and its customers for the change and the data-center company that’s too busy integrating various bits-and-pieces and positioning itself to consider the mundane technologies like IPv6. </p>
<p>Looking from outside, one has to ask himself: What good is IPv6 in the branch offices and campus networks if we cannot deploy it in the Data Center?
