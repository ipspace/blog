<p>I don’t know how your financial year works out; in Central Europe most companies’ financial year coincides with the calendar year. November and December are thus crazy planning/budgeting months, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointy-Haired_Boss">pointy-haired bosses</a> (<a href="http://www.nil.com/go/contacts">myself included</a>) trying to reduce expenses. Training is frequently one of the most exposed items and getting training funds outside of the budget is usually close to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_(film)"><em>Mission</em><em>:</em><em> Impossible</em></a>. Lesson: plan well what you want to spend in the next year.</p>
<p>Have I mentioned that I’m creating a number of <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Category:Workshop">WebEx-delivered workshops</a> (we can also arrange on-site events)? Most of them are designed as high-level overview presentations (for whatever reason people think I can create a presentation that’s not too technical but still stays far away from High-Level-Bulls**t) and I would love to do a few really in-depth ones (assuming I can get enough participants). If you want to attend them in the next year, use the following <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/not-to-exceed-NTE.html">NTE budgetary pricing</a>: </p>
<ul class="Bullet1"><li>€30 ($45)/hour/participant (two attendees @ 2-hour presentation = € 120);</li>
<li>€200 ($300)/hour for a private on-line workshop (up to 10 participants).</li>
</ul>
