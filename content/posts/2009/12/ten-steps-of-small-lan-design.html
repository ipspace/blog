<p>Every so often someone tries to apply the “let all be friends and love each other” mentality to LAN networks and designs a pure layer-2 switched LAN (because it’s simpler). Jay contributed a ten-step “what happens next” description in his comment to my “<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/12/lies-damned-lies-and-product-marketing.html">Lies, damned lies and product marketing</a>” post. The steps are so hilarious I simply had to repost them:</p>
<ol><li>Build everything at layer 2 because "it's simpler".</li>
<li>Scale a little. </li>
<li>Things start breaking mysteriously. Run around in circles. Learn about packet sniffers and STP.</li>
<li>Learn about layer 3 features in switches you already own. Start routing. </li>
<li>Scale more. </li>
<li>Things start breaking mysteriously. Learn about TCAMs. Start wishing for NetFlow. </li>
<li>Redesign. Buy stuff. </li>
<li>Scale more. </li>
<li>VMWare jockeys start asking about bridging across the WAN. </li>
<li>Enroll in hair loss program.</li>
</ol>
