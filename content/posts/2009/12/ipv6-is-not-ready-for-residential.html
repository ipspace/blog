title: IPv6 is not ready for residential deployment
url: /2009/12/ipv6-is-not-ready-for-residential.html
---

<p>The main driver for IPv6 deployment is the IPv4 address space exhaustion, caused primarily by fast growth of residential users. </p>
<p class="note">Each residential user needs an IP address, a small company doesn’t need anything more and even a reasonably-sized company can survive with a few IP addresses.</p>
<p>One would expect the vendor readiness to follow this pattern, but the situation is just the opposite: while the <a href="/2009/12/ipv6-in-campus-but-not-in-data-center.html">enterprise networking devices have pretty good IPv6 support</a> (<a href="/2009/11/ipv6-in-data-center-is-cisco-ready.html">Data Center components from some vendors are a notable exception</a>), the vendors serving the residential market don’t care.</p>

<p class="more">The Service Provider-related IPv6 challenges are covered in my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Market_trends_in_Service_Provider_networks"><em>Market trends in Service Provider networks</em></a> workshop. You can attend a web-based tutorial version or we can organize a dedicated workshop event for your team.</p>
<!--more--><p>It’s amazing how unprepared the residential vendors are: <a href="http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/nanog/msg02739.html">only a few of them offer IPv6-capable DSL CPEs or low-cost routers</a> (make sure you read the whole thread). When faced with the lack of IPv6 feature support, some vendors even have the nerve to <a href="http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/nanog/msg03143.html">hint that you should use a public-domain firmware instead of their own</a>. </p>
<p>The situation is no better in the 3play space: try finding a set-top box running IPv6. Oh, and all devices in the path should support wire-speed IPv6 multicast which is needed to deliver the video stream to set-top boxes.</p>
<p class="note">Realistically, I’d expect most of the 3play solutions staying within the IPv4 address space for a long time; they’re commonly using private IP addresses, so they are not affected by the IPv4 public address space exhaustion.</p>
