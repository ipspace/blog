<div class="bloggerBody"><p>A week ago <a href="http://bgpmon.net/blog/?p=191">AS13214 experienced internal problems and started readvertising all BGP routes</a> (the whole Internet) as part of its autonomous system (AS). A similar incident <a href="http://www.renesys.com/blog/2008/11/brazil-leak-if-a-tree-falls-in.shtml">occurred last November</a>. In both cases, the problem did not spread very far, which indicates that the major ISPs have implemented BGP filters and prefix limits.</p>
<p>One can only hope that every ISP in the world would have done the same. If you’re an ISP and you haven’t configured the <em>BGP maximum prefix </em>feature on your customer BGP sessions yet, please do so ASAP. A good starting point would be a <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_configuration_example09186a008010a28a.shtml">configuration example provided by Cisco</a> (it’s also accessible from the <a href="http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/serviceProviders.x?i=76">Service Provider Security Best Practices</a>).</p>
