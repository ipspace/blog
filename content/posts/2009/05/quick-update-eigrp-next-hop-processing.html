<p><b>Quick update:</b> A <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/05/eigrp-next-hop-processing.html?showComment=1243468740659#c4564381090481258856">comment by alvarezp</a> to my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/05/eigrp-next-hop-processing.html">EIGRP next-hop post</a> sent me back to the lab. I was spreading wrong rumors ... with the <b>no ip next-hop-self eigrp <em>AS</em></b> command configured, the next-hop field in the EIGRP updates is used and works as expected in NBMA and route redistribution environments. A detailed post will appear sometime next week.</p>
<p>I would also like to apologize for any confusion I might have caused.</p>
