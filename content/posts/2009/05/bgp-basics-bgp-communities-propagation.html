<div class="bloggerBody"><p>I’ve got this question from Pete:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Which community will be sent if only "neighbor {ip-address} send-community" is configured?</blockquote>
<p>Quick answer: only the standard BGP communities are propagated.</p>
<!--more--><h4>More details</h4><p>The <strong>neighbor send-community</strong> enables the community propagation. Without this option, no BGP communities will be sent to the BGP neighbor, even if they are attached to entries in the local BGP table. After the <strong>neighbor send-community </strong>has been configured, the router will start propagating the communities attached to BGP entries in its BGP table to the neighbor.</p>
<p>BGP has two community attributes: the <em>standard </em>BGP communities (defined in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1997">RFC 1997</a>) and <em>extended </em>BGP communities (defined in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4360">RFC 4360</a>). You can control which communities are sent to a BGP neighbor with the (very obvious) <strong>standard</strong>, <strong>extended </strong>or <strong>both</strong> options of the <strong>neighbor send-community </strong>router configuration command. If you use <strong>neighbor send-community </strong>with no extra options, only the standard BGP communities are propagated to preserve backward compatibility.</p>
