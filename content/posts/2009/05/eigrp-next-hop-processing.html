<div class="bloggerBody"><div class="stop"><p><b>Update @ 2009-06-01</b>: The exact EIGRP behavior in IOS releases 12.3 and later is described in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/EIGRP_next_hop_processing"><em>EIGRP next-hop processing</em></a> article in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT3 wiki</a>.</p>
<p><b>Update @ 2009-05-30</b>: The information in this post is incorrect, the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/05/quick-update-eigrp-next-hop-processing.html"><b>no ip next-hop-self eigrp</b> command changes EIGRP next hop processing</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.nil.com/"><img class="ImgFLTright" src="http://www.ioshints.info/images/Wiki.png"/></a>Yap Chin Hoong sent me a detailed e-mail describing his efforts to use the <em>Next Hop </em>field present in EIGRP routing updates. His conclusions (that I’ve subsequently verified with a few lab tests) were disappointing: although EIGRP updates have a <em>next hop </em>field, it’s not used (unlike <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2009/feb/25/making-use-ospf-forwarding-addresses/">OSPF forwarding address</a>).</p>
<p>When doing the tests, I’ve reused an old NBMA topology and thus started to wonder whether I hadn’t already tested the EIGRP behavior. Turns out I had … and summarized the EIGRP behavior as “<em>EIGRP updates contain no provision for changing IP next-hop address</em>” in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Next-hop_fixup_in_partially-meshed_NBMA_networks">Next-hop fixup in partially-meshed NBMA networks</a> article (In the meantime, I’ve fixed the text to reflect the reality).</p>
