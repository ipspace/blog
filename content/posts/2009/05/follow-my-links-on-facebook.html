<div class="bloggerBody"><p>I’ve decided to keep the stuff I find interesting separate from the IOS Hints blog (which has evolved into a purely network engineering site). If you’re interested in the links I’m publishing, check them on <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/pages/Ivan-Pepelnjak/28648908727">my Facebook page</a> (or follow the <em>Links </em>item in the <em>More to explore </em>section of the right sidebar). Facebook can also show you a <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/pages/Ivan-Pepelnjak/28648908727">list of the links I’ve published</a>.</p>
<p class="info">You don’t have to be a Facebook user to access the page or view the links, but if you’re already using Facebook and become a fan of my page, new links will automatically appear on your wall.</p>
