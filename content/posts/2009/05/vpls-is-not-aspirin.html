<div class="bloggerBody"><p><a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/"><img src="http://media.techtarget.com/searchTelecom/images/header_logo2.gif" style="float: right; margin: 2px 2px 2px 8px"/></a>If you’re old enough to remember the days when <em>switches </em>were still called <em>bridges </em>and were used to connect multiple sites over WAN links, you’ve probably experienced interesting network meltdowns caused by a single malfunctioning network interface card. Some of you might have had the “privilege” of encountering another somewhat failed attempt at WAN bridging: ATM LAN Emulation (LANE) service (not to mention the “famous” <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps633/products_data_sheet09186a008009229e.html">Catalyst 3000 switches with LANE uplink</a>).</p>
<p>It looks like some people decided not to learn from others’ mistakes: years later the bridging-over-WAN idea has resurfaced in the VPLS clothes. While there are legitimate reasons why you’d want to have a bridged connection across the Service Provider network, VPLS should not be used to connect regular remote sites to a central site without on-site routers. You can find several reasons for this claim in the “<a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid103_gci1354735_mem1,00.html">VPLS: A secure LAN cloud solution for some, not all</a>” I wrote for <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/">SearchTelecom</a>.</p>
