<div class="bloggerBody"><p><a href="http://wiki.nil.com/"><img class="ImgFLTright" src="http://www.ioshints.info/images/Wiki.png"/></a>In the last few years I wrote several <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner">IP Corner</a> articles covering small-site multihoming (a site connected to two ISPs without having its own public address space or running BGP). Now I’ve combined them in a comprehensive <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Small_site_multihoming"><em>Small site multihoming </em>tutorial</a> accessible in the CT3 Wiki.</p>
<p>I know numerous readers have asked me questions about this design solution, but unfortunately I haven’t saved all of them (I know one of them had to do with load sharing and another one with application-specific policy routing). If you were one of them and still remember your question, please <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Contact">resend</a> it; I plan to expand this tutorial in the following weeks.</p>
