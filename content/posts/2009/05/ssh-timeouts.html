<div class="bloggerBody"><p>The readers preparing for various certification exams are a constant source of amazing details, including this one:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I have configured <strong>ip ssh timeout 60</strong> and <strong>exec-timeout 5</strong> on VTY lines. Preferred input connection is ssh. How much time can I be idle?</blockquote>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/security/command/reference/sec_i3.html">IOS documentation</a>, the <strong>ip ssh timeout</strong> detects the problems in SSH negotiation phase (including user authentication) and the <strong>exec-timeout</strong> detects user inactivity after the user has logged in.</p>
<p class="important">Do not set <strong>ip ssh timeout </strong>to a very low value or you won’t be able to type your password before the router disconnects the session.</p>
