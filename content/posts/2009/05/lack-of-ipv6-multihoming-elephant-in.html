<div class="bloggerBody"><p class='important'>Update (2009-05-13): As Roland Dobbins pointed out in his comment, the <em>strictly hierarchical</em> approach to IPv6 address allocation is no longer valid. Another reader kindly provided me with a link to the <a href="http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-466.html#PIAssignments">RIPE IPv6 Address Allocation policy</a>.</p>
<p>I have to admit I have no hands-on Service Provider IPv6 experience (but then there are not too many people that can claim they do) and I don’t attend RIPE meetings, so I might have a completely wrong impression, but here it is: Is it just my perception or do we really lack any production-grade means of end-user multihoming in IPv6?</p>
<p class="more"><b>Update (2010-03-12)</b>: I've gathered a lot of IPv6-related information in the meantime. You will find an overview of the Service Provider-related IPv6 challenges in my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Market_trends_in_Service_Provider_networks"><em>Market trends in Service Provider networks</em></a> workshop (<a href="http://spmarkettrends.eventbrite.com/">register for the online webinar</a>). Advanced backbone designs and configurations are explained in the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core"><em>Building IPv6 Service Provider core</em></a> workshop (<a href="http://spipv6.eventbrite.com/">register for the online webinar</a>).</p>
<!--more--><p>Just to make sure we’re on the same page: businesses that care about their continuous presence on the Internet (somewhat close to 100% of large enterprises, I would dare to guess) and use Internet as one of their sales/delivery/support channels usually decide to connect to multiple (at least two) Internet Service Providers. Due to the current state of protocols above layer 3, an end-user that wants true multihoming needs their own chunk of publicly routable IP address space that is advertised to the world via BGP.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the IPv6 address space allocation policies should be strictly hierarchical to reduce the size of the IPv6 routing tables (which is a worthy goal), but this rules out the provider independent (PI) address space needed by multihomed customers.</p>
<p>The proposed solution to this issue (<a href="http://www.shim6.org/">shim6</a>) uses unique host identifiers over multiple IPv6 addresses, allowing the end-to-end communication to continue even if IPv6 endpoints change. Great idea, but the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/shim6-charter.html">shim6 working group</a> has not managed to publish a single RFC yet and it looks like <a href="http://www.shim6.org/">there are no production-grade implementations</a>.</p>
<p>I would be delighted if someone could tell me that I’ve missed something, but from my current perspective, we are years away from being able to deploy high-availability IPv6 public networks that we take for granted in the today’s IPv4 Internet.</p>
