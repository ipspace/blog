<p>I've found the following "gem" in the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps633/products_data_sheet09186a008009229e.html">Catalyst 3000 LANE module data sheet</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">The module "provides <b>legacy LANs</b> with access to ATM-based services in an ATM campus backbone".</blockquote>
<p> The <em>legacy LAN</em> was switched Ethernet (which is still around after 15 years) and ATM campus backbones have joined the dinosaurs.</p>
<p class="note">In case you've never seen a <a href="http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/si/casi/ca3000/prodlit/c3000_ds.pdf">Catalyst 3000</a>: it was a switch that Cisco got through one of its first acquisitions and although it was a good Ethernet switch, it was a nightmare to configure and the later additions (for example, the LANE module) were a disaster. Luckily, it was allowed to die a quiet death a few years later.</p>
