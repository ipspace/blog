<div class="bloggerBody"><p><a href="http://wiki.nil.com/"><img class="ImgFLTright" src="http://www.ioshints.info/images/Wiki.png"/></a>The <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/07/quick-quiz-ospf-lsa-generation.html">Friday’s OSPF quiz</a> has generated numerous answers … unfortunately many of them incorrect. Some readers (probably those that recently attended a Cisco certification exam) thought I was asking a trick question, as I’ve forgotten to include the IP addresses in the sample configuration, which only proves how hard it is to write good bulletproof questions.</p>
<p>Those that assumed the IP addresses would have to be configured on the interfaces made two common errors:</p>
<ul class="Bullet1"><li>Some assumed a type-2 LSA would be generated for the LAN interface. Wrong: type-2 LSA is generated only if needed (there is more than one router attached to the LAN interface).</li>
<li>Others thought the router would generate a type-1 LSA per interface. Wrong: an OSPF router generates only a single type-1 LSA per area.</li>
</ul>
<p>To clarify these issues, I wrote an article in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT3 wiki</a> <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Type-1_(Router)_LSA">documenting how the type-1 (router) LSA describes various interface types and inter-router links</a>.</p>
