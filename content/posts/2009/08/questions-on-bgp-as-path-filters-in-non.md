title: Questions on BGP AS-Path Filters in Non-Transit Networks

I've sent a link to my [*Filter excessively prepended AS-paths*](https://www.ipspace.net/kb/tag/BGP/Filter_Excessively_Prepended_BGP_Paths.html) article as an answer to a BGP route-map question to the NANOG mailing list and got several interesting questions from Dylan a few hours later. As they are pretty common, you might be interested in them as well.

You could use inbound AS-path filters to protect your BGP table, but as you\'re not a transit AS, it does not make much sense. You might also use them to reduce the size of your BGP table, but obviously you've already taken care of that.

> When I run the \"sh ip bgp quote-regexp \"\_(\[0-9\]+)\_\\1\_\\1\_\\1\_\\1\_ \\1\_\" \| begin Network\" I am seeing many paths that would be filtered by this access-list.

Obviously a lot of people are prepend-happy, but as I've stated in the original article, if prepending your AS number a few times doesn't help, nothing will.

> What happens to those networks, are they unreachable from my AS, or do I just route those networks to my upstream provider and let them deal with it?

If I understood correctly, you\'re using a default route toward AS Y, which means that anything that is not in your BGP table (and consequently your IP routing table) will be sent out of your AS via the default route. If you\'re getting the paths you\'re filtering from AS X that means that more traffic will go to AS Y.

No. You cannot influence the inbound traffic apart from not advertising some of your prefixes to some of your neighbors or giving them hints with BGP communities or AS-path prepending. Whatever you do with BGP on your routers influences only the paths the outbound traffic is taking. What you\'d actually need is remote-triggered black hole.
