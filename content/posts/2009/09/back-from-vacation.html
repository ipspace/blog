<div class="bloggerBody"><p>Some of you might have noticed that I was somewhat quieter than usual the last few days … and I had an excellent reason: finally I’ve managed to sneak a week of climbing vacations into my schedule. There’s a <a href="http://www.sourcealps.com/Site/Home.html">fantastic eco lodge</a> (chalet) in a <a href="http://www.samoens.com/anglais/INDEX/index/index.html">nice valley</a> between Chamonix and Geneva and they’re offering <a href="http://www.sourcealps.com/Site/Summer_at_La_Source.html">combined climbing-yoga classes</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.si/lh/photo/SVhWeTTK7h4Z3SAJ4462hw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_K_pkZO5-tTg/Sq9pc9gbtzI/AAAAAAAADsI/qQFhbSW0oMU/s288/P9060009.JPG"/></a></p>
<p>If you’re interested in one or the other, you simply have to try them … and in the meantime you can <a href="http://picasaweb.google.si/IPepelnjak/LaSource2009?feat=directlink">enjoy a few pictures I’ve taken during the week</a>.</p>
