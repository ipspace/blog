title: Display the rejected BGP routes

<div class="bloggerBody"><p>Jernej sent me an interesting question: “does Cisco IOS have an equivalent to the Extremeware’s <strong>show bgp neighbor </strong><strong><em>a.b.c.d </em></strong><strong>rejected-routes </strong>command which displays all routes rejected by inbound filters?”</p>
<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> it doesn’t.</p>
<!--more--><h3>Somewhat longer explanation</h3><p>If you want to display routes rejected by an inbound BGP filter, you have to store every route you ever received from the BGP neighbor, increasing the memory consumption of your BGP process. You can do that in Cisco IOS if you configure <strong>neighbor </strong><strong><em>a.b.c.d </em></strong><strong>soft-reconfiguration in</strong>.</p>
<p class="warn">Configuring per-neighbor inbound soft reconfiguration significantly increases BGP memory consumption. On top of BGP routes inserted in the main BGP table, the BGP process has to store every route received from the BGP neighbor in a neighbor-specific table (two copies of the accepted routes are needed because an inbound <strong>route-map </strong>might have changed the route attributes).</p>
<h3>Workaround</h3><p>Use this procedure to find rejected routes:</p>
<ul class="Bullet1"><li>Within the BGP process configuration, enter <strong>neighbor </strong><strong><em>a.b.c.d </em></strong><strong>soft-reconfiguration in</strong> (this command might clear the BGP session).</li>
<li>Populate the per-neighbor table with the <strong>clear ip bgp </strong><strong><em>a.b.c.d </em></strong><strong>soft in</strong>.</li>
<li>Display the routes received from the neighbor with the <strong>show ip bgp neighbor </strong><strong><em>a.b.c.d </em></strong><strong>received-routes</strong>.</li>
<li>Display the routes sent by the neighbor and accepted by the inbound BGP filters with the <strong>show ip bgp neighbor </strong><strong><em>a.b.c.d </em></strong><strong>routes</strong>.</li>
<li>Do a <em>diff </em>of the two printouts (if you’ll write a short Tclsh script that does that, please feel free to send it to me or submit it in the comments).</li>
</ul>
