<div class="bloggerBody"><p><a href="http://wiki.nil.com/"><img class="ImgFLTright" src="http://www.ioshints.info/images/Wiki.png"/></a>I thought I knew all there is to know about the AS-path prepending before <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2009/02/root-cause-analysis-oversized-as-paths.html">last month’s incident</a>, which prompted me to focus on this particular Cisco IOS feature. </p>
<p>For example, did you know you could do <em>inbound </em>AS-path prepending? I didn’t, until Rodney Dunn from Cisco mentioned it in an e-mail exchange. Did you ever wonder whether the AS-path prepending affects inbound or outbound AS-path filters? I had a hunch it doesn’t, but was never sure.</p>
<p>You can find everything you never wanted to know about AS-path prepending in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/AS-path_prepending_(technical_details)"><em>AS-path prepending (technical details)</em></a><em> </em>article in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT3 wiki</a>.</p>
