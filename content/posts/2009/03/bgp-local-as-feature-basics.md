I've always thought that Cisco introduced the *BGP Local-AS* feature into IOS to support complex MPLS VPN design scenarios. Obviously I was wrong, the early documentation always describes an ISP AS merging scenario. Unfortunately, all the articles I've found skip some important details: they describe the basics and the configuration commands, but forget to mention the impact on the AS paths received by the ISP customers.

I described those details in an article that has disappeared from the Internet sometime in 2019, but fortunately [archive.org retained a copy of it](https://web.archive.org/web/20171012143846/http://wiki.nil.com/Network_migration_or_merger_with_BGP_Local-AS_feature).
