<div class="bloggerBody"><p>A reader sent me an interesting question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Do you have any advice for resetting/logging into a router (2821) where <a href="/2007/03/one-time-passwords-on-cisco-routers/">the one time user</a> of cisco:cisco has already been used?</blockquote>
<p>I couldn't offer any better advice than performing the regular password recovery procedure. Is there another solution?</p>
