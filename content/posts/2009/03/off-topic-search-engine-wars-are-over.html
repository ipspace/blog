StatCounter, the free web tracking service I'm using has recently <a href="http://blog.statcounter.com/2009/03/launch-of-free-global-stats-tool/">launched</a> <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/">global statistics tool</a> that allows you to analyze the statistics of the data they're collecting from thousands of participating web sites. An interesting one is the "Search engine" graph:<br/><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/2009/03/SearchEngineStats.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="/2009/03/s400-SearchEngineStats.jpg" style="cursor: move;"/></a></div>
As you can see, Google has approximately 90% market share, Yahoo (the second place) has less than 10%, the others are clearly irrelevant.
