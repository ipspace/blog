Justin was right: although it’s best for the Service Provider to try to push BGP as far out as possible, it might make customer’s life more complex in some scenarios. I’ve decided to write an article about these PE-CE routing protocol issues, but as I’ve started writing it, it dawned on me: this is not a technical issue, but a business one. You can find my reasoning in the “<a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid103_gci1350577,00.html"><em>Choosing customer MPLS VPN routing protocols</em></a>” article published by <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/">SearchTelecom.com</a>.</p>
