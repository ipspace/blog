<div class="bloggerBody"><p>Yesterday I’ve <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/03/line-rate-and-bit-rate.html">described the difference between <em>line rate </em>and <em>bit rate</em></a> (actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_rate">physical layer gross bit rate</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_rate">physical layer net bit rate</a>). Going to the other extreme, we can measure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodput">goodput</a> (application-level throughput), which obviously depends on multiple factors, including the TCP window sizes and end-to-end delays. There are numerous tools to test the goodput from/to various locations throughout the world (<a href="http://www.speedtest.net/index.php">speedtest.net</a> worked quite nicely for me) and you’ll soon discover that the goodput on your DSL line differs significantly from what the ISP is advertising.</p>
<!--more--><p>Apart from obvious marketing ploys, the difference arises due to the baroque <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll">Russian dolls</a> encapsulation stack used on ADSL (see the ADSL-based protocol stacks section in <a href="http://www2.rad.com/networks/2005/adsl/encaps.htm">this document</a>). A typical PPPoE connection runs IP over PPP (2 bytes) over PPPoE framing (6 bytes) over Ethernet framing (14 bytes) over RFC 1483 bridged connection (8 bytes) <ins class="corr">over AAL5 (8 bytes)</ins> over ATM cells (5 byte overhead for every 48 bytes of payload). Every IP packet is thus burdened with <ins class="corr">38</ins> bytes of DSL protocol stack overhead plus 10.4% ATM cell tax. Assuming the average IP packet size in the Internet is around 500 bytes, the DSL protocol stack overhead is 6%, resulting in a total of over 16% of lost bandwidth just to accommodate the committees that constructed this monster.</p>
<p><ins class="corr">Update @ 2009-03-27: I forgot yet another encapsulation technique: AAL5. I also need to investigate whether the RFC 1483 bridged encapsulation really uses the 8-byte header (there are numerous options in the RFC).</ins></p>
