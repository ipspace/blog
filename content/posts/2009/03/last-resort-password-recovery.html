<div class="bloggerBody"><p>Pappyar has sent me an interesting password recovery technique, which can be used in those weird circumstances when you cannot force the router to go to ROMMON (for example, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/12/recovering-from-disabled-password.html">you’ve configured <strong>no service password-recovery </strong>and the <em>break </em>signal does not work as expected</a>). Unfortunately, his trick works only if you can remove the flash memory from the router (it’s soldered in low-end models):</p>
<ol><li>Turn off the router.</li>
<li>Take out the flash.</li>
<li>Turn on the router. </li>
<li>This time router will take you to ROMMON as it cannot find an IOS image.</li>
<li>Set the configuration register with confreg 0x2142.</li>
<li>Reset (this will change the stored value of the configuration register).</li>
<li>Turn off the router.</li>
<li>Reinsert the flash.</li>
<li>Turn on the router and you are done.</li>
</ol>
