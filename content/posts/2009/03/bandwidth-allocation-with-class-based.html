<div class="bloggerBody"><p>Sebastian sent me an interesting question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I have read that we can only use 75% of the bandwidth for the custom queues as 25% is reserved for the keepalives and routing protocol updates. If I want to set 50% of bandwidth for a particular queue should it 50% of the total bandwidth or 50% of the available 75% of the bandwidth?</blockquote>
<p>Before going into the details, it’s important to remember that the WFQ (CB-WFQ is only a mechanism to sort packets into output queues) uses relative ratios (percentages) between queues to determine which packet to send (the absolute bandwidths are used just to compute the ratios).</p>
<!--more--><p>To prevent the classified traffic from starving the routing protocols and other important packets (ARP, CDP, ILMI, Frame Relay keepalives …), the router does not allow the class queues to consume more than 75% of the total interface bandwidth. The remaining 25% are used for the default class (all non-classified traffic) as well as all non-IP packets. You can change the limit with the <strong>max-reserved-bandwidth</strong> interface configuration command; just make sure you have plenty of bandwidth left for the control traffic.</p>
<p>When you configure the class-based queuing with the <strong>bandwidth [remaining] percent </strong><strong><em>percent</em></strong> command, the number you specify is the percentage of the total interface bandwidth and is used to determine the ratios in the WFQ system. Obviously, the sum of all percentages and the <strong>max-reserved-bandwidth </strong>should not be more than 100.</p>
<p>When using the <strong>bandwidth </strong><strong><em>kbps </em></strong>command, the traffic in the class you’re configuring will get at least the specified amount of bandwidth. The bandwidth percentage is computed as the specified bandwidth divided by the interface bandwidth. </p>
<p class="info">The interface bandwidth can be set based on the actual hardware (it’s not hard to guess what the bandwidth of a 100BASE-TX interface is), <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/09/multilink-bundles-have-varying.html">computed for multilink bundles</a> or configured with the <strong>bandwidth </strong>interface configuration command.</p>
