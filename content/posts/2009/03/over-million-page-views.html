Two weeks ago Douglas Crockford wrote that <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-TBPekxc1dLNy5DOloPfzVvFIVOWMB0li?p=984">his blog generated more than a million page views</a>. Since he's an icon in the mainstream Web industry with his own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford">Wikipedia listing</a>, I simply had to check how my blog compares to that. Not bad, <a href="http://statcounter.com/">StatCounter.com</a> claims I had 1.2 million page loads in two and a half years.<br/><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/2009/03/BlogVisits.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="/2009/03/s400-BlogVisits.png" style="cursor: move;"/></a></div>
If you'll remain as loyal readers as you've been in the first three months of this year, we'll probably reach the million-a-year mark in 2009.
