<div class="bloggerBody"><p>One of my regular readers asked this question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I want to shut my particular interface after 6:oo pm every day. Right now I have just the general idea as to how EEM works. What I guessed is that when the router's clock ticks 6:00 pm a syslog message might be generated and event manager will catch it and execute the particular command. But I don’t understand how EEM monitors the clock so that it knows its 6:00 pm now and it has to generate a syslog message.</blockquote>
<p>If you want a quick answer, you’ll find the exact solution in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Time-based_wireless_interface_activity">Time-based wireless interface activity</a> article in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Category:EEM">EEM category</a> in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT3 wiki</a>. However, you might want to get a bit more out of this question.</p>

<!--more--><p>If you want to use EEM, the best investment of your time would be to spend an hour or two reading its introductory documentation, particularly the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/netmgmt/configuration/guide/nm_eem_overview_ps6441_TSD_Products_Configuration_Guide_Chapter.html">section describing the event detectors</a>. It nicely describes four time-based event detectors available in EEM. You can also try searching my blog and CT3 wiki. For example, I’ve <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2006/10/periodic-router-reload.html">written about EEM <strong>timer cron </strong>event</a> more than two years ago. The blog labels and wiki categorization should be of great help: start with the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/search/label/EEM">EEM label in the blog</a> and the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Category:EEM">EEM category</a> in the CT3 wiki.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there’s always more than one way to solve a problem with Cisco IOS. <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/11/kron-poor-man-cron.html">If you’re not happy with EEM, you can use Kron</a>.</p>
