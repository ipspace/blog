<div class="bloggerBody"><p>A <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/39021">post by CiscoSubnet</a> has pointed me to the <a href="http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAlert.x?alertId=17670">official IntelliShield alert describing the AS-path incident</a>. While the alert is very well written (I wouldn’t expect less) and the associated <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/protecting_bgp.html">Protecting Border Gateway Protocol for the Enterprise</a> is excellent, I was highly amused by the following text:</p>
<blockquote class="cite"><strong>Cisco Security Intelligence Operations has identified a method through</strong> which administrators can modify device configurations to mitigate the effects of the AS path processing issue.  Administrators can limit the amount of AS path segments that are associated with any route by using the <strong>bgp maxas-limit</strong> feature …</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>bgp maxas-limit </strong>command was suggested by some members of the NANOG mailing list as early as few hours after the incident (which happened on February 16<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span>; the IntelliShield alert has been released on February 20<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span>) and <a href="/2009/02/protect-your-network-with-bgp-maxas/">I’ve released a detailed article on February 17<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span></a>. I know Cisco’s engineers did a great job in this particular case; why did someone have to run their results through the <tt><strong>/usr/local/marketese | /usr/bin/bowdlerize</strong></tt>?</p>
