title: Build a VPN Across Your IP Network with Multi-VRF Feature

One of our customers had to provide end-to-end IP transport across their enterprise network for an outsourced video surveillance solution. We implemented a true VPN solution for them (the hosts in the enterprise network cannot access the surveillance equipment and vice versa) using the Multi-VRF feature available in all recent Cisco IOS releases. 

I described the solution *Add a VPN to an Enterprise Network with Multi-VRF Functionality* article; you'll find it somewhere in [this list](/kb/Internet/).
