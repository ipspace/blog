<p>If you want to understand the real impact of the recent Data Center hype without getting pulled into the technology morass the vendors so copiously spread in their white papers, read the <em>Foundation of Green IT </em>book published by Prentice Hall. Its author, Marty Poniatowski, uses two case studies to illustrate enormous savings that can be realized through server and storage consolidation. I loved the first half of the book: the author avoids the technology issues (I loved the introduction to RAID: “I do not cover RAID background … the Internet has a wealth of information on RAID”) and uses real-life data gathered in actual project to illustrate the savings. Each case study has several chapters, ranging from starting point discovery through implementation plans and ROI analysis; exactly what you need if you’re considering going down the data center redesign path. The “Desktop Virtualization” and “Data Replication and Disk Technology Advancements” chapters are thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>The author makes the server and storage consolidation case studies even more interesting by describing actual products/solutions and inserting screenshots of actual reports throughout the text. Not surprisingly, he’s describing what he knows best: HP servers, EMC storage and VMware virtualization; a clear indication how far Cisco has to go to win the hearts and minds of the data center market.</p>
<!--more--><p>After the fantastic first half, the second half is pure disappointment. It starts with three networking chapters that clearly show networking is not the author’s strong point. All of a sudden, the interesting real-life details are replaced with technology introductions … although the author quotes an IDC report in the preface claiming that the technology represents #9 (out of 10) challenge in data center environments. You’re pulled into quagmire of IOS release numbering and PSIRT advisories; the contrast with the excellent first half is all too obvious. There’s also no ROI analysis. No surprise: the author advocates replacing 10 obsolete low-end Fast Ethernet switches with a fully redundant Catalyst <del class="wrong">6507</del><ins class="corr">C4507R-E</ins>; I’d love to see a ROI analysis that can justify that investment based on power and cooling savings.</p>
<p>The last part is a hodgepodge of topics. I was looking forward to the <em>SQL Server Consolidation</em> chapter; more so as it was written by a Microsoft’s engineer. It was boring and could be summarized in a single sentence: SQL Server is another application that can be virtualized using the rules outlined in the first five chapters. </p>
<p>The <em>Green Data Center</em> chapter is undoubtedly the best part of the second half of the book; it succinctly describes the issues of cooling, air flow, data and power cabling … but then the quality starts sliding down with <em>Cloud Computing</em> (no wonder; I have yet to find someone who can write something I will find interesting about this vaporware architecture) and <em>Simple Power Savings</em> (summary: turn off your computer at night) chapters. The last chapter; <em>Managed Services: Remote Monitoring </em>is a pure product description of a software product the author’s company is selling.</p>
<p>Regardless of the shortcomings of the last chapters (which were probably thrown in to expand the scope; a better title would be <em>Foundation of Green Data Center</em>), I can strongly recommend the book for its excellent descriptions of server virtualization and storage consolidation issues. I also have to congratulate its author for his marketing prowess; the whole book is a great case study/white paper for the services his company offers … and we’re willing to pay for the privilege to read it.</p>
