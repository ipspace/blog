title: 'IPv6 in the Data Center: is Cisco ready?'

<p>With the recent Cisco’s push into the Data Center environment and all the (not so very unreasonable) fuss around IPv4 address depletion and imminent need for IPv6, I wanted to check whether an all-Cisco shop could do the first step: deploy IPv6 on Internet-facing production servers. If you follow the various design guidelines, your setup will have at least the following elements (and I bet someone from Cisco has already told you that you also need XML firewall, Ironport and WAAS appliance):</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/2009/11/ipv6_dc.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="/2009/11/s400-ipv6_dc.png"/></a><br/></div>
<p>Now let’s see how well these boxes support IPv6. </p>
<p class="note">I’m describing the Data Center IPv6 deployment issues in the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Enterprise_IPv6_Deployment_Workshop"><em>Enterprise IPv6 Deployment</em> workshop</a>. The diagram above was taken straight from the workshop materials.</p>
<!--more--><p>Routers and switches (both Catalysts running SXI release and Nexuses running latest NX-OS) support everything you need, including IPv6 layer 3 virtualization (IPv6 in VRF, also known as 6vPE).</p>
<p class="note">I couldn’t find 6vPE support in IOS XE Release 2, but then you’d most likely need it on the core switches, not on the edge routers.</p>
<p>ASA is a bit of a problem – the current software release does not support failover configurations with IPv6. The situation rapidly worsens as you go deeper into the <em>Application Networking Services</em>. I wasn’t able to find any mention of IPv6 in ACE, XML Gateway or WAAS configuration guides. If I’ve missed something, please let me know.</p>
<p>The status of IPv6 support in various Data Center components is summarized in the following table:</p>
<table class="codeTable"><tr><th>Equipment</th><th>Level of IPv6 support</th></tr><tr><td>Routers</td><td>Yes (6vPE on IOS XE might be missing)</td></tr><tr><td>Firewalls (ASA)</td><td>No redundancy (IPv6 failover doesn’t work)</td></tr><tr><td>Data center switches</td><td>Yes (Catalyst and Nexus)</td></tr><tr><td>Firewall Service Module (FWSM)</td><td>Not in transparent mode, on the main CPU (awfully slow) in routed mode.</td></tr><tr><td>Load balancers (ACE)</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Application-level firewall (XML Gateway)</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>WAN optimization (WAAS)</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Ironport</td><td>No</td></tr></table>
