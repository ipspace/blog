<p>Last week I’ve published <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/11/challenge-cb-wfq-bandwidthpolice.html">two</a> <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/11/off-topic-universal-engineers.html">posts</a> that deserve a follow-up/summary. Don’t worry, it’s coming. I’ve been extremely busy working on a customized version of the “<a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Market_trends_in_Service_Provider_networks">Market trends in Service Provider networks</a>” presentation that I’m delivering tomorrow … and I’ve managed to stumble across two “interesting” topics involving ITU; the first one is described in the next post and the second one needs a bit more investigation.</p>
