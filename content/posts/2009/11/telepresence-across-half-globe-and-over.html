<p>A few days ago we ran an interesting test: a Telepresence session from Slovenia (somewhere in Central Europe for those of you that cannot keep track of all the emerging minicountries) to US West Coast across the Internet. The session crossed numerous Service Providers and at least one VPN tunnel, but the quality was still amazingly good â€¦ you can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKJQcOMSinE">watch it in this YouTube video</a>.</p>
