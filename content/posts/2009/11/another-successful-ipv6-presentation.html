<p>Last week I’ve delivered another very successful <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Enterprise_IPv6_Deployment_Workshop"><em>IPv6 Deployment in Enterprise Networks</em></a> presentation. It’s amazing how far into the interesting details we usually get even though the presentation is purposefully a high-level one. This time we’ve been discussing the liabilities the Service Providers might get exposed to when using Large Scale NAT and whether the enterprise networks using HTTP proxies for Internet access could avoid the migration to IPv6. </p>
<p class="info">If you’re working in a large enterprise network and think your IT team could benefit from this presentation or associated <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Enterprise_IPv6_Deployment_Workshop">IPv6 workshop</a>, <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/about/send.php?StySu=Workshop+enquiry">get in touch with me</a>.</p>
