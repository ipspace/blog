title: Simulations in certification tests

<p style="text-align: left">Anyone who has ever had the “privilege” of interviewing a <a href="/2008/12/is-it-wise-to-use-certifications-in.html">certified individual with purely theoretical knowledge</a> appreciates the <a href="/2009/01/test-real-life-skills-of-your-job.html">value of hands-on tests</a>. The creators of certifications in the IT industry (including Cisco Systems) have responded by including more and more hands-on exercises in the certification exams. Unfortunately, <strong>Cisco decided not to use the real equipment, but rather simulations</strong>. While this is definitely better than relying exclusively on multiple-choice tests, <strong>students can still work their way through the simulations without having a decent level of hands-on experience</strong>.<!--more--></p>
<p class="warn">This blog post has been written in 2009. In the meantime, almost all labs are performed in virtual environments. Hopefully nobody is pushing the simulation products any longer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>The simulations are—by definition—not equivalent to the actual devices</strong>. The few I’ve seen accepted only a limited set of configuration or monitoring commands, sometimes even dictating the order in which the commands have to be entered. <strong>It’s quite easy to find the right command if the simulation allows you to use five or ten different commands</strong>. Figuring out the correct command from a three-page list of keywords (each of them followed by another page of options) is a completely different story. In a very limited environment, someone who has only vague ideas about the configuration process and the necessary steps might <strong>be able to complete the simulation, but would not have a chance to do the same trick when faced with an actual device</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Interestingly, the solution to this dilemma has been available for over a decade: several companies on the market offer true remote lab exercises (not the kind of equipment sharing where you get access to a rack of boxes for eight hours and have to start by cleaning up the mess left by the previous student). Some of these companies offer <strong>complex scheduling options, including the ability to schedule an exercise days or even weeks in advance</strong>. The willingness of end users to entrust their e-mail or documents to a “cloud service” somewhere on the Internet also proves that the global Internet has reached the level of reliability where users have stopped wondering whether they’ll be able to access a remote service. Thus, <strong>there is no technological barrier to using actual devices in the certification exams</strong>. So why is everyone (apart from the CCIEs) still stuck with the simulations?</p>
