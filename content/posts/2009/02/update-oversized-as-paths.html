<p><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/02/protect-your-network-with-bgp-maxas.html">I was wrong about the details</a> of <a href="http://www.renesys.com/blog/2009/02/the-flap-heard-around-the-worl.shtml">yesterday's Internet brownout</a>: older IOS releases don't recognize AS-paths having more than 128 AS numbers due to improper handling of <i>extended length</i> flag in the BGP UPDATE message (CSCdr54230).</p>
<p>However, quick stress tests indicate that classic IOS releases (including 12.2SRC) can't handle AS-paths having more than 255 AS numbers. IOS is able to accept (and properly process) inbound updates with two AS_SEQUENCE segments, but does not generate valid AS-path attribute in outbound update when there are more than 255 AS numbers in the AS-path, resulting in a NOTIFICATION message and continuously flapping BGP session. The only global protection you have against this behavior is the <b>bgp maxas-limit</b> router configuration command.</p>
