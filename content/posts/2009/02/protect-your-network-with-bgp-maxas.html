<p>Have you noticed how slow the Internet was yesterday? I almost blamed my kids (sometimes they manage to overload my WAN link), but it turned out to be a global problem. It looks like a greenhorn ISP (they joined RIPE less than four months ago) in central Europe managed to generate a BGP update with too many AS numbers in the AS path, confusing older routers. It’s my wild guess that those routers did not anticipate two AS_SEQUENCE attributes in the BGP update message. <a href="http://www.renesys.com/blog/2009/02/the-flap-heard-around-the-worl.shtml">You can find the details in the Renesys blog</a>; at the peak of the instability, they were receiving over 100.000 BGP updates <em>per second</em>.</p>
<p>It’s very easy to protect yourself (and your downstream neighbors) from an operational error like this one. Cisco has <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/iproute/command/reference/irp_bgp1.html">implemented the AS-path length limiting code in IOS release 12.2</a>. One would hope that the major ISPs would have started using this feature years ago; obviously that’s not the case. I <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Limit_the_maximum_BGP_AS-path_length">wrote an article in the CT3 Wiki describing the “intricate” details of this obviously ignored IOS feature</a> just to make sure everyone understands what the <strong>bgp maxas-limit</strong> command does (and hopefully implements it in this millennium)</p>
