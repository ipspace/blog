Furthermore, <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2009/01/interactions-between-ip-routing-and-qos.html">QoS is not linked to IP routing</a>; interface queues cannot apply backpressure to IP routing tables or influence load sharing ratios.</p>
<p>The only technology that can shift the excess traffic in high-speed IP-only networks from congested links to underutilized alternate paths is MPLS traffic engineering. The “<a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid103_gci1347878_mem1,00.html"><em>Using MPLS TE to avoid core network congestion</em></a>” article I’ve written for SearchTelecom describes the basic interactions of MPLS TE and QoS and introduces <em>autotunnel </em>and <em>autobandwidth </em>concepts.</p>
