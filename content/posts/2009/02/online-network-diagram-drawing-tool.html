<div class="bloggerBody"><p>Andrew Yourtchenko invested “a few evenings” (his choice of words) and produced an <a href="http://employees.org/~andin/network/">online diagram drawing tool</a>. There’s only one word to describe it: amazing.</p>
<p class="more">I guess Andrew appreciates if you’d use the <a href="http://employees.org/~andin/network.tgz">offline copy</a> after you’ve tested the tool (otherwise we might overload his hosted account).</p>
