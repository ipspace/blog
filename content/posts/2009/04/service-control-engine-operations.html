<div class="bloggerBody"><p>The <a href="http://www.nil.com/go/ccie_experts">CCIE gurus</a> in <a href="http://www.nil.com/go/development_references">NIL’s training department</a> have recently developed a brand new <a href="http://www.nil.com/ls/nil_sceo">Service Control Engine (SCE) Operations hands-on training</a>. The course covers the real-life needs of network engineers deploying SCE-based solutions. It provides numerous design solutions and case studies and does not focus exclusively on SCE but also on the associated Subscriber Manager (SM), Quota Manager (QM) and Collection Manager (CM) servers. The hands-on labs allow you to practice standard operational tasks, including traffic policy creation, subscriber operations and maintenance tasks.</p>
