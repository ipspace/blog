<div class="bloggerBody"><p>Cisco has unveiled numerous green solutions in the last few months, including <a href="http://etherealmind.com/2008/11/17/top-5-review-asr9000/">energy-saving ASR 9000 router</a> and <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/ns726/intro_content_energywise.html">GreenWise initiative</a>. Now they went a step further and implemented some of the old energy-efficient wireless technologies, proving that you donâ€™t always need new technologies to address the energy efficiency (see also <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=top-10-myths-about-sustainability&amp;page=3">Myth #8 in Top 10 Myths about Sustainability</a>). </p>
<p>The first step in GreenWise wireless rollout are the new high-density line cards for the ASR 9000 routers. The port adapters and SFP modules in these line cards will support RFC 1149 with its <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149">low-electricity requirements</a>, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1926">low-emission focused RFC 1926</a> as well as <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4824">RFC 4824 addressing the needs of the health care vertical market</a>. The first release of the line cards will not support all <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2549">QoS requirements of RFC 2549</a> due to the limited processing power of the on-card PPU.</p>
<p>You can find detailed information on these revolutionary line cards and adapters among the other <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9853/products_data_sheets_list.html">in-depth data sheets documenting ASR 9000 platform and line cards</a> (<a href="http://www.webcitation.org/5fXlh2MXq">snapshot of the page</a>).</p>
