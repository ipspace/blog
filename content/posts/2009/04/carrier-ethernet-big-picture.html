I’ve heard so much about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_Ethernet">Carrier Ethernet</a> in the last few years (not including confusing definitions of what it’s supposed to be) that I decided to write an article about it. It was recently published by <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/">SearchTelecom</a> as “<a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid103_gci1352831,00.html">Carrier Ethernet: Big picture issues for carrier deployment</a>”.</p>
