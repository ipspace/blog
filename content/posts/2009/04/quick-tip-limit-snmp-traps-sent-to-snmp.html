<div class="bloggerBody"><p>If you use multiple SNMP servers in your network, you might want to limit the traps each server receives. Configuring this functionality is easy: just list the traps you want a server to receive at the end of the <strong>snmp-server host </strong>configuration command.</p>
<p>When you specify the list of SNMP trap types a server should receive, a trap is sent to the server only if itâ€™s listed in the <strong>snmp-server host </strong>command <em>and </em>enabled with the <strong>snmp-server enable traps </strong>command.</p>
</div>
