<p style="text-align: left">The high-end books published by Cisco Press are usually pretty good, but every now and then they manage to produce a masterpiece that has all the potential to become a legend. The “IPv6 Security” book by Scott Hogg and Eric Vyncke is definitely in this category and <strong>is a must-read for anyone who plans to deploy IPv6 in the future</strong> (that should include around 100% of the network engineers).<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: left">What I liked most about the book is the fine long-lost tradition of <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/09/knowledge-or-recipes.html">teaching the technology, its inner workings and relevant details before jumping to boxes or configuration commands</a>. Even if you know enough IPv6 to pass the CCIE written test, you can still learn a lot about how it works, the internal packet structures, the design decisions and the inherent protocol vulnerabilities. Contrary to some other security books that look like a feature list from a Request for Proposal, this one <strong>manages to establish a delicate balance between technology description, vulnerability demonstrations and well-documented router configurations</strong>. The only problem I had with router configurations included in this book is that they tend to be long and complex, but that’s definitely a Cisco IOS problem, not a fault of the authors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>The other amazing feature is the book’s lack of Cisco-centrism</strong>. While it does cover only Cisco’s equipment on the network side (which is understandable), it also provides a thorough coverage of host operating systems and descriptions of a plethora of public-domain tools that can be used to hack, probe or protect IPv6 hosts or networks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Most books written by vendor engineers reveal to a careful reader the tug-of-war struggle between the author and external (usually product marketing-driven) forces. Yet again, this book is an exception. <strong>There are no “extra” features, the coverage is consistent and the level of detail doesn’t fade as you get closer to the last chapters</strong>. The topics covered by the book are included because they are needed, not because someone wanted to sell his favorite features.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">It doesn’t make sense for this review to describe each individual chapter in detail; you can always get the table of contents on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/IPv6-Security-Networking-Technology/dp/1587055945/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cisioshinandt-20&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1238486168&amp;sr=1-1">Amazon.com</a>. Let me just conclude by saying that this book will get a place of honor on my bookshelf.</p>
