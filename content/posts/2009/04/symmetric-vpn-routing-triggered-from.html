<div class="bloggerBody"><p>A few days ago, Brent <a href="http://forum.nil.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=45">asked a really interesting question</a> in <a href="http://forum.nil.com/">NIL’s forum</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I am wondering if there is a way to change routing preference from using one VPN link to another VPN link, and making this change only at one side (head end) of the bundled vpn's and have the traffic path still remain symmetric.</blockquote>
<p>One of the solutions I’ve proposed (<a href="http://forum.nil.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=45">using BGP with weights and MED on the central router</a>) worked really well for him.</p>
<p class="more">If you have an interesting network-related problem, you might consider using <a href="http://forum.nil.com/">NIL’s forums</a> to ask <a href="http://www.nil.com/go/ccie_experts">NIL’s CCIEs</a> for an opinion. If you’re new to BGP and would like to use it in your enterprise network, start with the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/BGP">BGP resource center</a> in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT3 wiki</a>.</p>
