<div class="bloggerBody"><p>George sent me a question that surfaced age-old memories:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I saw the Serial 0/1/0 interface in one of your articles. I understand the Serial 0/1 command as accessing the sub interface of Serial 0 with the 1st interface. But I have never seen the 2nd 0 being used. What is the 2nd "0", and how is it to be used?</blockquote>
<p>In the ancient times when the high-end router was an <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/routers/ps428/tsd_products_support_eol_series_home.html">AGS+</a>, the interface names were kept simple (for example, <em>Serial0</em>). When the Cisco 7000 was introduced with <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/routers/ps359/products_tech_note09186a00800c8282.shtml">online insertion and removal</a> (OIR) capability, router's life became more complex, as its actual hardware (and thus the interface names) might change while it's running.</p>
<!--more--><p>To work around this problem, the interface names changed with Cisco 7000 (and broke quite a few of our scripts). Every interface name on that router had two parts: the slot number and the port-in-slot number. Later the same convention was adopted for most modular routers (it doesn’t make sense to have all your interfaces renumbered if you exchange a 2-port WAN card with a 4-port WAN card) and with the addition of WIC (Wan Interface Card) adapters which are effectively module-on-a-module, we’ve got the third layer of interface hierarchy. The <em>Serial2/1/0</em><em> </em>interface is thus port#0 on WIC#1 on NM#2.</p>
<p>There are (at least) two other special characters in the interface names:</p>
<ul class="Bullet1"><li>Dot (.) indicates a subinterface. <em>Serial0/1/0.101 </em>is subinterface 101 on WAN interface <em>Serial0/1/0</em>.</li>
<li>Colon (:) indicates a channel or channel group on a channelized interface (BRI, E1, T1 …).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re aware of any other interface name format, please take your time to write a comment.</p>
