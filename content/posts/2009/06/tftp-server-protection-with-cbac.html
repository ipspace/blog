<div class="bloggerBody"><p>I had an interesting debate with an engineer who wanted to use TFTP between a router and a server reachable through an <em>outside </em>interface. He realized that he needed to configure (application-level) TFTP <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2007/06/inspect-router-generated-traffic.html">packet inspection for router-generated traffic</a>, but unfortunately Cisco IOS does not support this particular combination.</p>
<p>His query prompted me to read the TFTP RFC, which clearly documents that the data packets sent by the server are coming from a different UDP port number (thus the need for application-level inspection). The results of my tests are available in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/TFTP_server_protection_with_Context-Based_Access_Control_(CBAC)">TFTP server protection with Context-Based Access Control (CBAC)</a> article.</p>
