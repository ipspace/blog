A few months ago, a [small ISP was able to disrupt numerous BGP sessions in the Internet core by prepending over 250 copies of its AS number to the outbound BGP updates](https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/02/root-cause-analysis-oversized-as-paths.html). While you should use the **bgp maxas-limit** command to limit the absolute length of AS-path in the inbound updates, you might also want to drop all excessively prepended BGP paths.

For more details, read the [*Filter Excessively Prepended BGP Paths*](/kb/tag/BGP/Filter_Excessively_Prepended_BGP_Paths.html) article.
