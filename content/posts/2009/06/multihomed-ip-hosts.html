<div class="bloggerBody"><p>A few weeks ago, a member of the NANOG mailing list <a href="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/nanog/users/115046">asked an interesting question</a>: is it OK for a host to have two physical interfaces in the same IP subnet (obviously with two different IP addresses)?</p>
<p>The follow-up discussion uncovered an interesting fact: although such a configuration is quite unusual in the modern IP world, it’s explicitly permitted by RFC 1122. The discussion also exposed numerous problems you might experience when trying to deploy this design on a Linux host as well as some misconceptions about the source IP addresses in TCP and UDP packets.</p>
<p>I’ve summarized the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Multihomed_IP_hosts">topologies defined in RFC 1122</a>, <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Multihomed_IP_hosts">IP addressing rules pertinent to TCP/UDP clients and servers</a> as well as <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Multihomed_IP_hosts">problems you might experience</a> in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Multihomed_IP_hosts"><em>Multihomed IP hosts</em></a><em> </em>article in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT3 wiki</a>.</p>
