<div class="bloggerBody"><p><a href="http://wiki.nil.com/"><img class="ImgFLTright" src="http://www.ioshints.info/images/Wiki.png"/></a>A few months ago, a <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2009/02/root-cause-analysis-oversized-as-paths.html">small ISP was able to disrupt numerous BGP sessions in the Internet core by prepending over 250 copies of its AS number to the outbound BGP updates</a>. While you <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Limit_the_maximum_BGP_AS-path_length">should use the bgp maxas-limit command to limit the absolute length of AS-path in the inbound updates</a>, you might also want to drop all excessively prepended BGP paths. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Filter_excessively_prepended_BGP_paths"><em>Filter excessively prepended BGP paths</em></a><em> </em>article in the CT3 wiki describes the AS-path access list you can use to drop any BGP prefix that has more than X consecutive copies of the same AS number.</p>
