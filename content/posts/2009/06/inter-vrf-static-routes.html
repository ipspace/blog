<div class="bloggerBody"><p>Swapnendu was trying to implement inter-VRF route leaking in <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Multi-VRF_based_VPN">multi-VRF environment</a> without using route targets. He decided to use inter-VRF static routes, but got concerned after <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk436/tk832/technologies_configuration_example09186a0080231a3e.shtml">reading the following paragraph from Cisco’s documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">You can not configure two static routes to advertise each prefix between the VRFs, because this method is not supported. Packets will not be routed by the router. To achieve route leaking between VRFs, you must use the import functionality of route-target and enable Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) on the router. No BGP neighbor is required</blockquote>
<!--more--><p>There is no reason why inter-VRF static routes on point-to-point interfaces would not work. However … if Cisco's documentation states something is not supported, that's exactly what it is: not supported. It might work for you, it might not work on specific platforms and it might be broken in a future software release (like <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/12/mpls-support-on-1800-series-routers.html">MPLS VPN on 1800 routers</a>). You're using it at your own risk and if it stops working you can't even complain to the TAC (because they'll tell you it's unsupported).</p>
<div class="info"><ul><li>All the details of Multi-VRF design and deployment are covered in the “<em>Virtual router connectivity</em>” chapter of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1587051125?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cisioshinandt-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1587051125">MPLS and VPN Architectures (Volume II)</a> book.</li>
<li>You might want to use inter-VRF NAT instead of route leaking. It’s described in the “<a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/EnterpriseMultiVRF/"><em>Add a VPN to an Enterprise Network with Multi-VRF Functionality</em></a>” <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner">IP Corner</a> article.</li>
