<div class="bloggerBody"><p>I’m looking for a touch screen device that would work (well) with PowerPoint. I’d like to start drawing my diagrams with a pen, not with a mouse; I have a completely unfounded irrational belief that drawing with a pen might be faster and easier than using a mouse. Any (tested) ideas?</p>
