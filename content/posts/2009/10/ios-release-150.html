<div class="bloggerBody"><p>This is not an April 1<sup>st</sup> post: I’ve just realized that Cisco quietly released IOS 15.0M (mainstream). Haven’t tested it yet, but the images for a large variety of platforms are already available on CCO. The <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/15_0/15_0_1_m/15_0_1_m_newfeatlist.html">new features listed in the documentation include</a>:</p>
<ul class="Bullet1"><li>Full BFD support, including static routes, BFD-in-VRF and BFD-over-Frame Relay (next step: test it on a 2800-series router);</li>
<li>DHCP authentication;</li>
<li>DMVPN tunnel health monitoring;</li>
<li>EEM 3.1 (whatever that is, the EEM documentation hasn’t been updated yet);</li>
<li>Interaction between IS-IS and LDP;</li>
<li>BGP local convergence in MPLS VPN networks (the feature has already been available in 12.2 SRC, now it’s available on more platforms);</li>
<li>OSPF graceful shutdown and OSPF TTL security check features are available on more platforms;</li>
<li>Intra-zone traffic inspection in zone-based firewall.</li>
</ul>
<p>It looks like (as expected) the 15.0 release is a grand merge of all previous IOS trains (with a few extra features). Good job; finally we have something new to play with :)</p>
