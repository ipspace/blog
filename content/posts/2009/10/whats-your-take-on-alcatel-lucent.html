<p>Approximately a month ago Alcatel-Lucent launched <a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/convergedbackbone/"><em>Converged Backbone Transformation</em></a> (are they sharing <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/10/ios-packaging-moores-law-won.html">marketing wizards with Cisco</a> … or is the excessive hype an industry-wide phenomenon?): a visionary(?) convergence of IP and optical technologies. If you haven’t heard about it yet, you could try to start with the <a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/DocumentStreamerServlet?LMSG_CABINET=Docs_and_Resource_Ctr&amp;LMSG_CONTENT_FILE=Other/Alcatel-Lucent_Redefines_the_Core_IDC_Newsflash.pdf">IDC report published on Alcatel-Lucent’s web site</a> (I’m always amazed how some people manage to tell so little in so many words). </p>
<p>Once you get past the fluff to the details, it could be that they're implementing a lot of common-sense. For example, it looks like the <em>lambda-level grooming </em>replaces GBIC/SFP transceivers with something that can generate multiple lambdas on the router and feed these lambdas directly into the DWDM gear. In my understanding, it replaces the <em>GE port-GBIC-fiber-GBIC-GE port-lambda generation-DWDM</em> chain with the shorter and cheaper <em>GE port-lambda GBIC-fiber-lambda port-DWDM</em> chain (obviously, I might be completely wrong; it’s hard to deduce the details from a press release). </p>
<p>Anyhow, I’d really appreciate your thoughts on this launch. Does it make sense? How does it compare to what Cisco and Juniper are doing? Is this a move in the right direction … or is Alcatel-Lucent playing a catch-up and trying to cover it with a grand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchitecture">marketecture</a>?</p>
