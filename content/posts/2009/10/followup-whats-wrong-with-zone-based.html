title: 'Followup: What’s wrong with the Zone-Based Firewalls book'

<p>I’d like to thank all the readers that took time and responded to my question about the failure of my Deploying Zone-Based Firewalls book. The sad short conclusion is: while everyone would love to have an electronic copy of the book, the technology and the mindsets are simply not ready yet. Here are the details:</p>
<!--more--><p><strong>You hate DRM. </strong>So do I. Every DRM scheme treats you like a common criminal that has to be severely restricted so that he can do the least damage to the “high-value” property the DRM is trying to protect (not to mention the risks of DRM failures, sellers going bankrupt etc.). For example, the Adobe Digital Editions (if it works at all … I was never able to get it running properly on my laptop) allow you to install the same book on a few machines, but you can’t carry it with you as you could a paper copy.</p>
<p><strong>DRM on books is either too restricted or useless</strong>. As someone wrote in his comment, he prints the every digital book the moment he receives it (and you can always print it to a PDF printer). If the DRM protection doesn’t allow you to print the book, it’s probably too restricted; if it does, it’s useless.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone loves downloadable PDF. </strong>Pirates included. Let’s be realistic: if you can view protected PDF files within an open-source viewer on Linux (and copy “protected” material from them), anyone with enough time can unprotect them, remove <em>downloading user </em>indication (PDF is not so hard to modify) and post them.</p>
<p><strong>Safari is no protection.</strong> The digital books available on Safari in HTML and PDF format can be pirated as easily as anything else. For example, I’ve found the complete <em>MPLS and VPN Security </em>book from Cisco Press available “for free” in HTML format. I doubt Cisco Press released it that way; it was probably scraped from Safari (or some other HTML source).</p>
<h4>Other issues</h4><p>The fact that Cisco was giving away copies in non-DRM PDF format, the stealth marketing the book received (numerous comments indicated the readers using the zone-based firewalls were not aware the book exists) and problems with the ordering platform (you can’t order the DRM-protected PDF from Amazon, you have to do it through Cisco Press web site) didn’t help either.</p>
<p>The title of this post is “what’s wrong with my book”, so I’ll stop here. Many readers made very positive comment and offered useful suggestions that I’ll definitely follow. I would also recommend that you buy your copy of the book on Kindle or through Safari to avoid the Adobe DRM hassle.</p>
