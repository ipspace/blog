<p>The Slovenian IPv6 summit where I <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/09/deploying-ipv6-in-enterprise-networks.html">presented my views on IPv6 deployment in enterprise networks</a> was a huge success, with over 130 attendees (not bad for a country with only 2M people) and Martin Levy from Hurricane Electric as the keynote speaker. The event (<a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sl&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fipv6.go6.si%2F%3Fpage_id%3D836">the program as translated by Google</a>) was organized by fantastic people from the <a href="http://ipv6.go6.si/">Go6 Institute</a>. Unfortunately the go6 web site is only in Slovenian (try Google translator if you want to be highly amused or totally confused), but you can <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/IOSHints/ipv6-deployment-in-enterprise-networks">view my presentation</a>, read the <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20091012006254&amp;newsLang=en">Hurricane Electric press release</a> or <a href="http://ipv6.go6.si/?p=1620">browse the photos</a> (I’m in the right-hand picture in the third row).</p>
<p>Someone took notes and <a href="http://ipv6.go6.si/?p=1654">posted them on the go6 web site</a>. The notes for Martin’s keynote and my presentation are in English (just search for our names).</p>
<p class="info">Last but not least, if you’re based in Europe and you’d like me to deliver <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/IOSHints/ipv6-deployment-in-enterprise-networks">my presentation</a> at your local IPv6 event, <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/about/send.php">send me a message</a>.</p>
