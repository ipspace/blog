<p>A quick question for you: in two years since my <a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=1587053101">Deploying Zone-based Firewalls digital short cut</a> (marketese for downloadable PDF) was published, we’ve sold around 200 copies of it. Obviously we’re doing something wrong and I’d appreciate your opinion: is it the topic (are you using ZB firewall on Cisco IOS?), the format (would you prefer paper copy?), the platform (Cisco IOS as a firewall), pricing ($14.99 for 112 pages) or something else?</p>
