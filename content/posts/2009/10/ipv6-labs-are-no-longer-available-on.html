<p>Csaba asked me about the availability of our <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2008/02/ipv6-remote-labs-on-partner-education.html">IPv6 remote labs on Partner Education Connection</a>. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I was happy when I found this information, but after a while I realized that IPv6 labs are no more available on PEC site. Do you know any details why this topic has been removed from PEC or it can be that IPv6 is still there just I couldn't find it?</blockquote>
<p>Cisco has removed almost all external remote labs from PEC in October. To increase the confusion, some of them might still appear in the catalog, but you cannot start them. The only thing we could do was to inform the users landing on our web site that the labs are no longer available and that they could buy them from our product catalog.</p>
