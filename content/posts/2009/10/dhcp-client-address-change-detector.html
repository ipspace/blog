<div class="bloggerBody"><p><a href="http://wiki.nil.com/"><img class="ImgFLTright" src="http://www.ioshints.info/images/Wiki.png"/></a>In a previous post I’ve described <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2009/09/dhcp-logging-in-cisco-ios-is-nightmare.html">how useless DHCP logging is when you try to detect change in DHCP-assigned IP address</a>. Fortunately the removal of the old IP address (triggered by the DHCPNAK server response) and configuration of the new IP address (sent in the DHCPACK response) triggers a change in the IP routing table that can be detected with the new IP routing table event detector introduced in EEM 3.0 (available from Cisco IOS release 12.4(22)T).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Detect_DHCP_client_address_change_with_EEM_applet">EEM applet that detects the changed DHCP-assigned IP address</a> (including the initial address assignment which also triggers the syslog message) is described in the CT3 wiki.</p>
