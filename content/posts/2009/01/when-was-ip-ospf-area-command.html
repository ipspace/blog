<blockquote class="cite">The <strong>ip ospf area </strong>does not work on all platforms/IOS versions. I noticed that it works on 7600s(12.2SRB4), but not on 7200(12.2(23)). Is it IOS/platform specific or a newly introduced command? </blockquote>
<p>There are two reasonably accurate ways to figure out which IOS release contains the command you're interested in: the Feature Navigator and the IOS reference documentation. </p>
<p>It's sometimes hard to discover how the IOS marketing called the feature implementing your command, so the IOS reference manuals usually yield a faster answer. However, you still have to select the correct reference manual to open ... unless you use the <a href="http://tools.cisco.com/Support/CLILookup/cltSearchAction.do">Command Lookup Tool</a>, which quickly finds the relevant part of the documentation. In my case, I easily figured out that the <strong>ip ospf area </strong>command became available in 12.0S, 12.3T (and therefore 12.4), 12.2SB and 12.2SRB.</p>
<p class="info">To add icing to the cake, you can add the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/tsweb/searchplugins/plugin_homepage.html">Command Lookup Tool to your browser’s search toolbar</a>.</p>
