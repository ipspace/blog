<div class="bloggerBody"><p>I’ve just opened the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/public/news_training/itsnews/200901.html">January Technical Services News</a> from Cisco. Nothing in there that would really interest me. Almost no routing protocols (one OSPF article), no BGP, no MPLS VPN. Based solely on this newsletter, one could get the feeling that I’m producing more documents covering core IP routing in a month than Cisco (I am positive that’s not the case).</p>
<p>But maybe Cisco’s engineers are refocusing on the new <a href="http://supportwiki.cisco.com/">Support Wiki</a>. Not really. After I’ve filtered out sequential changes to a single document, there were only <a href="http://supportwiki.cisco.com/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges&amp;days=30&amp;limit=100&amp;hideminor=1">11 significantly changed documents in the Support Wiki in the last 30 days</a>.</p>
<p>So I’m left wondering … what’s going on? Has everything already been written about the core IP routing features and the productive minds have shifted to voice and wireless? Are the engineers focused on IP routing becoming the dinosaurs? What’s your perspective?</p>
<p>But one thing is clear: I need to slow down.</p>
