<p style="text-align: left">Numerous companies use <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/12/certifications-new-barrier-to-entry.html">certifications to screen job candidates</a>. Even if all the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2008/12/is-it-wise-to-use-certifications-in.html">caveats associated with this process</a> are given, you might encounter candidates who have multiple high-level certifications but <a href="http://unroutable.blogspot.com/2008/10/certification-musings.html">cannot differentiate a router from a box of cheese</a>. How can you identify (and reject) such people?<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Surprisingly, the solution is very easy: <strong>give them access to a few boxes and assign a simple configuration task</strong>. For high-end candidates, develop a scenario that closely mimics your network—or what you plan your network to be in a year (after all, you’re hiring people to work on your network), build a small test lab and give each candidate a few hours to complete the task. Provide Internet access, too; <strong>having the ability to find solutions on the Net is an important skill these days</strong>. When the work is done (assuming that the candidate doesn’t just run out of the building when you mention the lab), <strong>review the configuration with the candidate and let him/her explain what was done and why</strong>.</p>
<p class="warn">This whole process is undoubtedly time-consuming, so you should use it only in the very last step of the selection process, when the number of candidates is manageable. However, the <strong>results will more than justify the costs</strong>: you’ll be able to select the candidates who have proven to you that they’re the best available.</p>
