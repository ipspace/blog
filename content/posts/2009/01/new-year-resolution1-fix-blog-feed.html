<div class="bloggerBody"><p>More than a year ago, I got extremely upset by the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/11/your-opinion-matters-full-versus-short.html">SEO spammers that copied content from my blog feed</a> and decided to reduce the feed into article summaries. However, I didn’t want to have half-finished sentences in my feed the way Blogger or Wordpress implement their short feed format. As I have already implemented something similar to the Wordpress’ <em>more</em> tag in Blogger, that would be a natural cutoff point. For shorter posts, I would like to retain whole paragraphs … or, as I’ve summarized the dilemma: <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/12/feed-format-conclusions.html">I would like to give you enough information to decide whether you want to read the article or not</a>.</p>
<!--more--><p>Finally I found time to implement a reasonably good feed filter that:</p>
<ul class="Bullet1"><li>Does not touch the purely introductory posts (for example, those that point you to a Wiki article). If I followed a link from my feed reader to a post whose single purpose is to send me to another article, I know I would be mightily annoyed.</li>
<li>Cuts off the posts that have the <em>more </em>tag at that point, giving me total control over what I want to have in the summary of a lengthy post.</li>
<li>Reduces the post to approximately 350 characters (HTML markup not included in the count) while retaining its structure (a top-level paragraph, quote or DIV is never truncated).</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">If you experience any problems with the new feed or would like to use my solution (warning to OpenSource zealots: it’s written in VBScript), please do <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Contact">let me know</a>.</p>
