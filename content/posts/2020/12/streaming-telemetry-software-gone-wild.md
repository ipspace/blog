Remember [my rant](/2020/12/updated-ansible-parsing-content.html) how "_fail fast, fail often sounds great in a VC pitch deck, and sucks when you have to deal with its results_"? Streaming telemetry is no exception to this rule, and [Avi Freedman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avifreedman/) (CEO of Kentik) has been on the receiving end of this gizmo long enough to have to deal with several generations of experiments... and formed a few strong opinions. 

Unfortunately Avi is still a bit more diplomatic than [Artur Bergman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oebqlzblfyo) -- another CEO I love for his blunt statements -- but based on his [NFD16 presentation](/2017/09/nfd16-first-impressions.html) I expected a lively debate, and I was definitely not disappointed.
