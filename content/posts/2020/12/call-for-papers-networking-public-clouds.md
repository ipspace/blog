In early November we organized a [2-day network automation event](https://www.ipspace.net/NetAutSol/Live) as part of our [Network Automation](https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions) course and the participants loved the new format... so we decided to use the same approach for the Spring 2021 [Networking in Public Clouds course](https://www.ipspace.net/PubCloud/).

This time we're trying out another bit of the puzzle: while we have plenty of ideas whom to invite, we'd love to get the most relevant speakers with hands-on deployment experience. If you've built an interesting public cloud solution, created a networking focused automation or monitoring tool, helped organizations migrate into a public cloud, or experienced a phenomenal failure, we'd like to hear from you. Please check out our [Call for Papers](https://www.ipspace.net/PubCloud/Call_for_Papers) and send us your ideas. Thank you!
