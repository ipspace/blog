One of my readers encountered an interesting problem when upgrading a data center fabric to 100 Gbps leaf-to-spine links:

* They installed new fiber cables and SFPs;
* Everything looked great... until someone started complaining about application performance problems.
* Nothing else has changed, so the culprit must have been the network upgrade.
* A closer look at monitoring data revealed CRC errors on every leaf switch. Obviously something was badly wrong with the whole batch of SFPs.

Fortunately my reader took a closer look at the data before they requested a wholesale replacement... and spotted an interesting pattern:
<!--more-->

* All leaf switches _apart from one_ had _input_ CRC errors on _one of the uplinks_ but not the other. What if there was a problem with the spine switch?
* The spine switch on the other side of the "faulty" uplinks had _input_ CRC errors on the link toward the one leaf switch with no CRC errors, and _output_ CRC errors on all other links.

Knowing Ethernet fundamentals, one should ask a naive question at this point: "_isn't CRC checked when receiving packets and how could you get one on the transmit side?_" Fortunately my reader also understood the behavior of cut-through switching and quickly identified what was really going on:

* The one link with no errors on the leaf switch had a bad transceiver, resulting in CRC errors on the spine switch, but no errors in the other direction;
* The spine switch was configured for cut-through switching, so it propagated the corrupted packets, and _stomped the CRC on egress ports_ to prevent the downstream devices from accepting the packet... increasing the _transmit CRC error_ counter at the same time.
* Downstream leaf switches received corrupted packets originally sent over the faulty link and increased their _receive CRC error_ counters.

They replaced the faulty SFP, the errors disappeared, and life was good. As for the original performance problem... maybe it wasn't the network ;)
