As always, it's time to shut down our virtual office and disappear until early January… unless of course you have an urgent support problem. Any paperwork ideas your purchasing department might have will have to wait until 2021.

I hope you’ll be able to disconnect from the crazy pace of networking world, forget all the unicorns and rainbows (and [broccoli forest of despair](https://networkingnerd.net/2012/11/08/juniper-land-of-unicorns-and-broccoli/)), and focus on your loved ones -- they need you more than the dusty router sitting in a remote office. We would also like to wish you all the best in 2021!
