title: "Making LLDP Work with Linux Bridge"

Last week I described how I [configured PVLAN on a Linux bridge](/2020/12/pvlan-libvirt.html). After checking the desired partial connectivity with **ios_ping** I wanted to verify it with LLDP neighbors. Ansible **ios_facts** module collects LLDP neighbor information, and it should be really easy using those facts to check whether port isolation works as expected.

{{<cc>}}Ansible playbook displaying LLDP neighbors on selected interface{{</cc>}}
```

- name: Display LLDP neighbors on selected interface
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: true
  vars:
    target_interface: GigabitEthernet0/1
  tasks:
  - name: Display neighbors gathered with ios_facts
    debug:
      var: ansible_net_neighbors[target_interface]
```

Alas, none of the routers saw any neighbors on the target interface.

Fortunately, I wasn't the [first one experiencing this problem](https://xkcd.com/979/). It turns out Linux bridge blocks packets sent to IEEE-reserved MAC addresses (MAC addresses used by LLDP, LACP, STP, 802.1X, PBB control plane), but you can change that behavior by modifying the **group_fwd_mask** system parameter.

You can find all the gory details in a [blog post by Robin Gilijamse](https://interestingtraffic.nl/2017/11/21/an-oddly-specific-post-about-group_fwd_mask/), what we need to do is to [set group_fwd_mask to 0x4000](https://the-bitmask.com/2017/08/04/fwd-lldp-frames-on-linuxbridge/). To do that we need to write the desired value into **â€Œ/sys/class/net/*device*/bridge/group_fwd_mask**. The device name is the Linux bridge name (not *libvirt* network name) and to find it, we need to use **virsh net-info** command.

Another boring task worth automating. Here's the Bash script doing it (invoke it with *libvirt* network name).

```
#!/bin/bash
network=${1:-NBMA}
bridge=$(virsh net-info ${network}|grep Bridge|awk '{ print $2 }')
echo "libvirt network ${network} is Linux bridge ${bridge}"
echo "... enabling LLDP on ${bridge}"
sudo sh -c "echo 0x4000 >/sys/class/net/${bridge}/bridge/group_fwd_mask"
```

After changing the **group_fwd_mask**, LLDP works like a charm:
