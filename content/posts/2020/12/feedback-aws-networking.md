Deciding to create [AWS Networking](https://www.ipspace.net/Amazon_Web_Services_Networking) and [Azure Networking](https://www.ipspace.net/Microsoft_Azure_Networking) webinars wasn't easy -- after all, there's so much content out there covering all aspects of public cloud services, and a plethora of certification trainings (including free training from AWS).

Having that in mind, it's so nice to [hear from people who found our AWS webinar useful](https://www.ipspace.net/Amazon_Web_Services_Networking#Happy_Campers) ;)

> Even though we are working with these technologies and have the certifications, there are always nuggets of information in these webinars that make it totally worthwhile. A good example in this series was the ingress routing feature updates in AWS. 

> It can be hard to filter through the noise from cloud providers to get to the new features that actually make a difference to what we are doing. This series does exactly that for me. Brilliant as always. 

Other engineers use our webinars to prepare for AWS certifications -- read [this blog post](https://neckercube.com/posts/2020-12-18-how-i-passed-the-aws-advanced-networking-specialty-exam/) by [Jedadiah Casey](https://twitter.com/Wax_Trax) for more details.
