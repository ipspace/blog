After _[figuring out what business problem you're trying to solve](/2020/09/video-define-the-problem-first.html)_ and _[what the users expect to get from you](/2020/11/video-know-user-needs.html)_ it's time for the next crucial question: _[should you buy a shrink-wrapped product/solution or build your own](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/NetBiz/BF3%20-%20Should%20You%20Build%20or%20Buy%20a%20Solution.mp4)_? I addressed that question in the third part of _[Focus on Business Challenges First](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetBiz#BF)_ presentation.

Not surprisingly, the same dilemma [applies to network automation solutions](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutSol&module=1#M1S3), and is often the [source of endless time wasting discussions](https://twitter.com/ioshints/status/1332678958203228161) that I really should have stopped engaging in, but [sometimes duty calls](https://xkcd.com/386/) ;)
