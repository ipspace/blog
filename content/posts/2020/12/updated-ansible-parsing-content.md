Recording the same content for the third time because [software developers decided to write code before figuring out what needs to be done](/2019/09/measure-twice-cut-once-ansible/) is disgusting... so it took me a long long while before I collected enough willpower to rewrite and retest [all the examples](https://github.com/ipspace/NetOpsWorkshop/tree/master/Ansible/Networking/Get-Operational-Data) and re-record the *[Getting Operational Data](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Ansible#NET_DATA)* section of *[Ansible for Networking Engineers](https://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers)* webinar.

The new videos explain how to consume data generated by **show** commands in JSON or XML format, and how to parse the traditional  text-based **show** printouts. I dropped mentions of (semi)failed experiments like Ansible **parse_cli** and focused on things that work well: TextFSM, in particular with **ntc-templates** library, pyATS/Genie, and TTP. On the positive side, I liked the slick new **cli_parse** module... let's hope it will stay that way for at least a few years.

On a totally unrelated topic, I realized (again) that *fail fast, fail often* sounds great in a VC pitch deck, and sucks when you have to deal with its results.
