[Donal O Duibhir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/podomere/) was trying to get me to present at [INOG](https://inog.net/) for ages, and as much as I'd love to get to Ireland we always had a scheduling conflict.

Last week we finally made it work - unfortunately only in a virtual event, so I got none of the famous Irish beer - and the video about [alternate universes of public cloud networking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8mQEOvRNmE&feature=youtu.be) is already online.

> Multi-cloud works best in Powerpoint

> In the end there will be a VM somewhere. Serverless means, you outsourced the sysadmin

Enjoy... and don't forget to watch the fantastic [Psychology of IPv6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDy-lwtMn-I&feature=youtu.be) presentation by Veronika McKillop.
