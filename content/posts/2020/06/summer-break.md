Almost [30 webinars](https://www.ipspace.net/Webinars/#Recent_webinars), an [online course](https://www.ipspace.net/PubCloud/), and [over 140 blog posts later](/2020/) it's time for another summer break. 

While we'll do our best to reply to support and sales requests (it might take us a bit longer than usual), don’t expect anything deeply technical for the next two months... but of course you can still [watch over 280 hours of existing content](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual), [listen to over 100 podcast episodes](https://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild/), or [read over 3500 blog posts](/).

We’ll be back with [tons of new content](https://www.ipspace.net/Webinars/Sessions) in early September.

In the meantime, automate everything, get away from work, turn off the Internet, and enjoy a few days in your favorite spot with your loved ones!
