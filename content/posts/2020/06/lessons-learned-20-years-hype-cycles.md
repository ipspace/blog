Michael Mullany analyzed [20 years of Gartner hype cycles](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/8-lessons-from-20-years-hype-cycles-michael-mullany) and got some (expected but still interesting) conclusions including:

* Nobody noticed major technologies even when they were becoming mainstream
* Lots of technologies just die, others make progress when nobody is looking
* We might get the idea right and fail badly at implementation
* It takes a lot longer to solve some problems than anyone expected

Enjoy the reading, and keep these lessons in mind the next time youâ€™ll be sitting in a software-defined, intent-based or [machine-learning](https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/10/worth-watching-machine-learning-in.html) $vendor presentation.
