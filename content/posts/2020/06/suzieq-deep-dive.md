In early May 2020 I [wrote a blog post introducing SuzieQ](/2020/05/suzieq-useful-network-management-system.html), a [network observability platform](https://github.com/netenglabs/suzieq) Dinesh Dutt worked on for the last few years. If that blog post made you look for more details, you might like the [Episode 111](http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_111-SuzieQ.mp3) of [Software Gone Wild](https://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild/) in which we went deeper and covered these topics:

* How does SuzieQ collect data
* What data is it collecting from network devices
* What can you do with that data
* How can you customize and extend SuzieQ
