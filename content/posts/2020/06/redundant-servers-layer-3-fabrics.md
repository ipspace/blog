A long while ago I decided to write an article explaining how you could run VMware NSX on ESXi servers with redundant connections to two top-of-rack switches on top of a layer-3-only fabric (a fabric with IP subnets and VLANs limited to a single top-of-rack switch). Turns out that's [Mission Impossible](/2020/02/do-we-need-complex-data-center-switches/), so I put the article on the back burner and slowly forgot about it.

Well, not exactly. Every now and then my subconsciousness would kick it up and I'd figure out yet-another reason why it's REALLY hard to do it right. After a while, I decided to try again, and completely rewrote the article. The first part is already online, more details coming (hopefully) soon.
