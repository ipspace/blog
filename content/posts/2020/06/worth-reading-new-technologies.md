Every few years someone within the ITU-T (the standard organization that mattered when we were still dealing with phones, virtual circuits and modems) realizes how obsolete they are and tries to [hijack](/2010/09/ipv6-experts-strike-again.html) and/or [fork](/2010/11/what-is-mpls-tp-and-is-it-relevant.html) the Internet protocol development. Their latest attempt is the "New IP" framework, and Geoff Huston did a great job [completely tearing that stupidity apart in his May 2020 ISP column](https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2020-05/futuretech.html). My favorite quote:

> It’s really not up to some crusty international committee to dictate future consumer preferences. Time and time again these committees with their lofty titles, such as “the Focus Group on Technologies for Network 2030” have been distinguished by their innate ability to see their considered prognostications comprehensively contradicted by reality! Their forebears in similar committees missed computer mainframes, then they failed to see the personal computer revolution, and were then totally surprised by the smartphone.

Enjoy!
