In one of [his recent blog posts](https://networkingnerd.net/2020/08/28/iron-chef-certification-edition/) Tom Hollingsworth described what I semi-consciously felt about the CCIE lab exam for at least 25 years: it's full of contrived scenarios that look more like Iron Chef than real life. 

I understand they had to make the lab harder and harder to stop cheating (because talking with candidates and flunking the incompetents is obviously not an option), and there's only so much one can do with a limited set of technologies... but forcing networking engineers to find ever-more-devious ways to solve overly-complex problems is nothing else but fuel for [rampant MacGyverism](/2013/08/temper-your-macgyver-streak/).

Anyway, I don't think this mess will ever be fixed, so the only thing we can do is to [enjoy the rant](https://networkingnerd.net/2020/08/28/iron-chef-certification-edition/).
