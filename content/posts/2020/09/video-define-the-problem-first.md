In December 2019 I finally turned my _[focus on business challenges first](https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/12/focus-on-your-business-not-fancy.html)_ presentation into a short webinar session (part of _[Business Aspects of Networking Technologies](https://www.ipspace.net/Business_Aspects_of_Networking_Technologies)_ webinar) starting with _[defining the problem before searching for a solution](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/NetBiz/BF1%20-%20Define%20the%20Problem%20Before%20Searching%20for%20a%20Solution.mp4?doccode=NetBiz)_ including three simple questions:

* What BUSINESS problem are you trying to solve?
* Are there good-enough alternatives or should you really invest into new technology and/or equipment?
* Is the problem worth solving?
