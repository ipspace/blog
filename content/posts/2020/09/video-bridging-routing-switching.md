If you're working solely with IP-based networks, you're likely assuming that hop-by-hop destination-only forwarding is the only packet forwarding paradigm that makes sense. That is not true; even today's networks use a variety of forwarding mechanisms, most of them called some variant of *routing* or *switching*.

What exactly is the difference between the two, and what is bridging? I'm answering these questions (and a few others, like what's the difference between data-, control- and management planes) in the [Bridging, Routing, and Switching Terminology](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/SW1%20-%20Terminology.mp4?doccode=Net101) video.
