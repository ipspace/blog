[Post-quantum cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography) (algorithms resistant to quantum computer attacks) is quickly turning into another steaming pile of hype vigorously explored by various security vendors. 

[Christoph Jaggi](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Christoph_Jaggi) made it his task to debunk at least some of the worst hype, collected information from people implementing real-life solutions in this domain, and wrote an [excellent overview article](/kb/QuantumCrypto/) explaining the potential threats, solutions, and current state-of-the art. 

You (RFC 6919) OUGHT TO read his article before facing the first vendor presentation on the topic.
