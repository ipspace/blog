Earlier this year, [Pete Lumbis](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Pete_Lumbis) returned as an ipSpace.net webinar guest speaker with a great presentation describing data center switching ASICs from the perspective of networking engineers. After a [brief intro](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/DCFabric/AS1%20-%20Introduction.mp4?doccode=DCFabric), he started with [ASIC Basics](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/DCFabric/AS2.1%20-%20ASIC%20Basics.mp4?doccode=DCFabric)... a topic which generated a [25-minute Q&A session](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/DCFabric/AS2.2%20-%20ASIC%20Basics%20-%20Questions%20and%20Answers.mp4?doccode=DCFabric).
