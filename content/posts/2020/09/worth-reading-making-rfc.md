Years ago I was naive enough to participate in writing an IETF document. Three years later we [finally managed to turn it into an RFC](/2015/02/rfc-7454-bgp-operations-and-security/), and I decided that was enough for one lifetime.

But wait, it gets worse... as Geoff Huston [argues in his article](https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2020-08/ietfstd.html), the lengthy review process doesn't necessarily result in better (or more precise) documents.

Seems like we managed to turn IETF into yet another standard body like IEEE, ISO or ITU/T.
