One of the _weekend reads_ [collected by Russ White](https://rule11.tech/) contained a pointer to a [hilarious description of blockchain](https://thecorrespondent.com/655/blockchain-the-amazing-solution-for-almost-nothing/86649455475-f933fe63) - a solution in search of a problem. Here are a few quotes to get you started (and I had a really hard time selecting just a few):

> I’ve never seen so much bloated bombast fall so flat on closer inspection. 

> At its core, blockchain is a glorified spreadsheet.

> The only thing is that there’s a huge gap between promise and reality. It seems that blockchain sounds best in a PowerPoint slide.

Someone should use that article as a framework and replace blockchain with OpenFlow or SDN ;)
