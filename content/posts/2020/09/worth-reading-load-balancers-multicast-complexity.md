Justin Pietsch published another must-read article, this time dealing with [operational complexity of load balancers and IP multicast](https://elegantnetwork.github.io/posts/Lessons-from-load-balancers-and-multicast/). Here are just a few choice quotes to get you started:

* A critical lesson I learned is that running out of capacity is the worst thing you can do in networking
* You can prevent a lot of problems if you can deep dive into an architecture and understand itâ€™s tradeoffs and limitations
* Magic infrastructure is often extremely hard to troubleshoot and debug

You might find what he learned useful the next time you're facing a unicorn-colored slide deck from your favorite software-defined or intent-based vendor ;))
