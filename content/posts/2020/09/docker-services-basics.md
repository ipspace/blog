Last week I [published an overview of how complex (networking-wise) Docker Swarm services can get](https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/08/docker-swarm-services.html). This time let's focus on something that should have been way simpler: [running container-based services on a single Linux host](/kb/DockerSvc/index.html).

In the [first part of this article](/kb/DockerSvc/index.html) I'm focusing on the basics, including [exposed ports](/kb/DockerSvc/10-Exposed.html), and [published ports](/kb/DockerSvc/20-Published.html).
