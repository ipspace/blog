I hope you\'re familiar with [Clarke\'s third law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws) (and leave it to your imagination to explain how it relates to SDN ;). In case you want to look beyond the Machine Learning [curtain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RQxD4Ff7dY), you might find the [Machine Learning Explained](http://rodneybrooks.com/forai-machine-learning-explained/) article highly interesting. Spoiler: it all started in 1960s with over 2000 matchboxes.
