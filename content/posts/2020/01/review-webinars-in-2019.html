<p>A year ago I wrote about <a href="/2019/01/webinars-plans-for-2019.html">ipSpace.net plans for 2019</a>. While we created over 50 hours of webinar content and over 20 hours of course content in 2019, let’s see how well we delivered on my promises.</p>
<blockquote><p>Following AWS Networking webinar, we’ll do a similar one on Azure (in early autumn 2019) and GCP (late 2019 or early 2020)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Microsoft_Azure_Networking">Azure: done</a>. GCP: postponed. Let’s see how <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">serious</a> Google is about that particular project.<!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p>The materials for Docker 101 refresh has been ready for quite a while. It’s currently scheduled for late spring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Failed. Current plan: <a href="https://www.sig-switzerland.ch/docker/">on-site workshop on March 10th 2020</a> (triggering a refresh of the materials) with live webinar session scheduled for April 9th 2020.</p>
<blockquote><p>Matthias Luft will run a series of webinars on cloud security</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Cloud_Security">Done</a> with more sessions scheduled in near future.</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ll do more on VMware NSX</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ipspace.net/VMware_NSX_Technical_Deep_Dive">Done</a>. Another NSX-T update planned after the next major NSX-T release.</p>
<blockquote><p>We hope Mitja Robas will have time to do Cisco ACI deep dive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Failed. Mitja got pulled into a totally different direction.</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ll also start a completely new series focused on networking fundamentals</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work">Done</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rachel Traylor will continue her series of math-in-networking webinars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Fundamentals">Done</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dinesh Dutt will complement that material with Open Networking webinars explaining how to do networking on Linux and Linux-based network devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost… Dinesh decided to focus on <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Network_Operating_System_Models">Network Operating Systems</a>.</p>
<p>From the “might do” list of things we delivered <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/EVPN_Technical_Deep_Dive">EVPN in Service Provider networks</a>… and for whatever reason nobody wanted to touch Kubernetes or OpenStack networking ;)</p>
<p>Overall: pretty good.</p>
<p>Of course we also did a number of things we didn’t talk about or didn’t even consider in January 2019:</p>
<ul><li>Dinesh Dutt talked about <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=EVPN#HOSTS">running EVPN on hosts</a>, and Lukas Krattiger explained how to do <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=EVPN#MH">EVPN multihoming</a> and <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=EVPN#L47SVC">service insertion with EVPN</a>;</li>
<li>Donald Sharp explained the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/FRRouting_Architecture_and_Features">architecture and features of FRR routing suite</a>;</li>
<li>Pete Lumbis described <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DCFabric#CUMULUS">recent features introduced in Cumulus Linux</a>;</li>
<li>Christopher Werny augmented the existing IPv6 security webinar with <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_security">recent hands-on experience</a>;</li>
<li>Matthias Luft did a brief <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Cloud_Computing">introduction to cloud computing</a>;</li>
<li>I did a refresh of <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Designing_Private_Cloud_Infrastructure">Designing a Private Cloud Infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Interconnects">Data Center Interconnects</a> webinars;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to get access to all these goodies, there’s only one thing you have to do; <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual">standard or expert subscriptions</a> are waiting for you.</p>
