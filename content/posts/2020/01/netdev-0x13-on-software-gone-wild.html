<p>The last <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild/">Software Gone Wild</a> podcast recorded in 2019 <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_108-NetDev_0x13.mp3">focused on advances in Linux networking</a> - in particular on interesting stuff presented at NetDev 0x13 conference in Prague. The guests (in alphabetical first name order) <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/person/Jamal%20Hadi%20Salim">Jamal Hadi Salim</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrijeet-mukherjee-b275/">Shrijeet Mukherjee</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sowmini/">Sowmini Varadhan</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-herbert/">Tom Herbert</a> shared their favorite topics, and commented on the future of Linux networking.<!--more--></p>
<hr/><p>Shortly after the blog post was published, <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Donald_Sharp">Donald Sharp</a> (of the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/FRRouting_Architecture_and_Features">FRR fame</a>) sent me detailed explanation of FRR threading behavior we briefly touched upon during our chat<hr/><p>Currently both BGP and Zebra have been  modified to take advantage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads">pthreads</a>. Each pthread does use the  micro thread/event loop as you alluded to Shrijeet but they are  independent entities now.</p>
<p>Zebra creates a pthread per connecting protocol as well as having a  dplane and processing pthreads. So for example if you have BGP and  OSPF running, Zebra would have 4 pthreads running. BGP has a i/o  pthread, keepalive pthread and main processing pthread (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iVeuwHlEFDqwMXXG1SCMe4ngJf8dHjPbKln4Pz0B9vw/edit?usp=sharing">more details</a>). </p>
<p>Long term plans are to eventually add more pthreads but only after  appropriate profiling shows a need to break up processing a bit more.  The only protocol that I foresee someone adding pthreads to is PIM in  the near future, mainly because that protocol is very chatty.  <div class="jump-link" data-markdown="1"><a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_108-NetDev_0x13.mp3">Listen to the podcast</a></div>
