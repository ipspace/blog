title: Public Cloud Networking Security is Different

<p>If you’re running a typical (somewhat outdated) enterprise data center, you’re using tons of VLANs and firewalls, use VLANs as security zones, and <a href="/2015/05/replacing-central-router-with-next.html">push inter-VLAN traffic through firewalls for inspection</a>. Security vendors love that approach - when inspecting traffic they can add no value to (like database- or backup sessions), the firewalls quickly become choke points that have to be upgraded.</p>
<!--more--><p>Networking security in public clouds is totally different - you’re supposed to use <a href="/2013/03/the-spectrum-of-firewall-statefulness.html">stateful packet filters</a> (usually called security groups) in front of every VM and use dynamically-updated VM groups instead of IP addresses or subnets to specify traffic source and destination. Inserting your own <a href="/2012/11/virtual-firewall-taxonomy.html">VM-based firewall</a> into the forwarding path is pretty hard in AWS and Azure… and might become expensive as public cloud providers happily charge you for every VM resource you use.</p>
<p class="info">AWS recently launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-vpc-ingress-routing-simplifying-integration-of-third-party-appliances/">Ingress VPC Routing</a> feature that makes it easier to inspect traffic coming from the outside of your cloud environment, but the setup is still interestingly complex.</p>
<p>Is it safe to replace traditional firewalls with packet filters? Should you bring your own firewall appliance or use edge firewalls provided by major public cloud providers? Should you combine edge firewall with intra-cloud security groups? How hard would it be to insert your own firewall VM into the forwarding path, and is it worth it? Can you do it for intra-cloud traffic, or does it work only for external traffic? How could you implement a firewall instance failover? We’ll address all these questions in our <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/PubCloud/">Networking in Public Cloud Deployments</a> online course.
