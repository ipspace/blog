<p>I hope you're familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws">Clarke's third law</a> (and leave it to your imagination to explain how it relates to SDN ;). In case you want to look beyond the Machine Learning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RQxD4Ff7dY">curtain</a>, you might find the <a href="http://rodneybrooks.com/forai-machine-learning-explained/">Machine Learning Explained</a> article highly interesting.
