<p>I always tell networking engineers attending our <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course to create minimalistic data models with (preferably) no redundant information. Not surprisingly, that’s a really hard task (see <a href="/kb/DataModels/">this article</a> for an example) - using a simple automation tool like Ansible you end with either a messy and redundant data model or Jinja2 templates (or Ansible playbooks) full of hard-to-understand and impossible-to-maintain business logic.</p>
<p>Stephen Harding solved this problem the right way: his <a href="https://github.com/sjhloco/ip_auto_lab/tree/master/data_model">data center fabric deployment solution</a> uses a dynamic inventory script that translates operator-friendly fabric description (data model) into template-friendly set of device variables.<!--more--></p>
<p>That by itself would be no mean feat, but he went much further. His solution supports tenants, L3VNIs, L2VNIs, VLANs, single- or dual-homed interfaces, and per-tenant routing protocols… resulting in a solution pretty close to what those people who use Cisco ACI as VLAN manager do (warning: trolling detected, no need to react :D).</p>
<p>I would highly recommend you explore his solution, and I’m positive he won’t be upset if you improve it and submit a pull request ;)</p>
<p>You might also want to explore our <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/NetAutSol/Solutions">Network Automation Solutions Showcase</a> - sample solutions created by the attendees of our <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course.</p>
