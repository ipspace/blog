<p>It's amazing how heaping layers of complexity (see also: SDN or intent-based whatever) manages to destroy performance faster than Moore's law delivers it. The <a href="https://danluu.com/input-lag/">computer with lowest keyboard-to-screen latency was (supposedly) Apple II built in 1983</a>, with modern Linux having keyboard-to-screen RTT matching the <a href="https://wondernetwork.com/pings">transatlantic links</a>.</p>
<p>No surprise there: Linux has been <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/11/04/an-analysis-of-performance-evolution-of-linuxs-core-operations/">getting slower with every kernel release</a> and it takes an enormous effort to fine-tune it (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oebqlzblfyo">assuming you know what to tune</a>). Keep that in mind the next time someone with a hefty PPT slide deck will tell you to build a "provider cloud" with packet forwarding done on Linux VMs. You can make that work, and smart people made that work, but you <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2016/03/you-want-your-network-to-be-like.html">might not have the resources to replicate their feat</a>.</p>
