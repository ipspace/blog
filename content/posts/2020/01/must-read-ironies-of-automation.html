<p>Stumbled upon a 35-year-old article <a href="https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Bainbridge_1983_Automatica.pdf">describing the ironies of automation</a> (HT: <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2020/01/08/ironies-of-automation/">The Morning Paper</a>). Here’s a teaser…</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately automatic control can ‘camouflage’ system failure by controlling against the variable changes, so that trends do not become apparent until they are beyond control.</p>
