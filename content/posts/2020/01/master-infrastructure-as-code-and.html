<p>Doing the same thing and hoping for a different result is supposedly a definition of insanity… and managing public cloud deployments with an unrepeatable sequence of GUI clicks comes pretty close to it.</p>
<p>Engineers who mastered the art of public cloud deployments realized decades ago that the only way forward is to treat infrastructure in the same way as any other source code:<!--more--></p>
<ul><li>Keep the infrastructure definition in a set of text-based configuration files;</li>
<li>Keep track of changes with a version control tool (Git if you want to be hip, RCS if you’re an aging guru with socks and sandals);</li>
<li>Use an infrastructure-as-code tool to align the current state of your infrastructure with the desired state defined in your configuration files. If this sounds like an intent-based system, you’re right - smart engineers were doing it way before marketers realized the selling value of another buzzword).</li>
</ul>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/PubCloud/">Networking in Public Cloud Deployments</a> online course, we’ll explore the automated cloud infrastructure deployments, infrastructure-as-code tools, and related concepts like immutable infrastructure. Going one step further, you’ll use these concepts throughout the hands-on exercises. We expect you’ll submit your solutions as a set of deployment-ready text files in a Git repository using any tool of your choice. You could use vendor-specific tools like AWS CloudFormation or Azure Resource Manager, multi-cloud tools like Ansible or Terraform, or whatever other tools you want to try out.</p>
