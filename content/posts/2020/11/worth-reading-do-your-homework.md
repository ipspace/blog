Tom Hollingsworth wrote [another must-read blog post](https://networkingnerd.net/2020/11/13/looking-for-a-mentor-dont-forget-this-important-step/) in which he explained what one should do **before** asking for help:

> If someone comes to me and says, “I tried this and it failed and I got this message. I looked it up and the response didn’t make sense. Can you tell me why that is?” I rejoice. That person has done the legwork and narrowed the question down to the key piece they need to know. 

In other words (again his), _do your homework first_ and then ask relevant questions.
