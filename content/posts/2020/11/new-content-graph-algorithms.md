Last week we enjoyed the second half of _[Graph Algorithms](https://www.ipspace.net/Graph_Algorithms_in_Networks)_ lecture by [Rachel Traylor](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Rachel_Traylor), this time focusing on [flow- and connectivity challenges](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Algorithms#FLOW).

After an easy start defining flows and walking us through various _maximum flow_ algorithms, Rachel explained _circulations_ and _saturating flows_, switched into high gear with (supposedly painless) intro to [linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) and _minimum cost flow_ problems, and concluded with _dynamic flows_ and _using flows to explore graph connectivity_.
