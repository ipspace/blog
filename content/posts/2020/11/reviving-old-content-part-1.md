More than a decade ago I published tons of materials on a web site that eventually disappeared into digital nirvana, leaving heaps of broken links on my blog. I decided to clean up those links, and managed to save some of the vanished content from the Internet Archive:

* [OSPF Flooding Filters in Hub-and-Spoke Environments](/kb/tag/OSPF/OSPF_Flood_Reduction_Hub_Spoke.html)
* [Implicit and Explicit Null Label in MPLS networks](/kb/tag/MPLS/Implicit_Explicit_NULL.html)
* [Default Routes in BGP](/kb/tag/BGP/Default_Route.html)
* [Filter Excessively Prepended BGP Paths](/kb/tag/BGP/Filter_Excessively_Prepended_BGP_Paths.html)

I also updated dozens of blog posts while pretending to be Indiana Jones, including:
<!--more-->
* [Management, Control, and Data Planes in Network Devices and Systems](https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/08/management-control-and-data-planes-in.html)
* [Control Plane Protection Overview](https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/11/control-plane-protection-overview.html)
* [BGP Route Reflector Details](https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/08/bgp-route-reflector-details.html)
* [Control Plane Protection Overview](https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/11/control-plane-protection-overview.html)
* [OSPF Router ID Selection: the Gory Details](https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/04/ospf-router-id-selection-all-details.html)

You'll find the list of all blog posts updated within the last 30 days in the *Recently Updated* box in the right-hand sidebar.

And now I'm off to another archeological dig ;)
