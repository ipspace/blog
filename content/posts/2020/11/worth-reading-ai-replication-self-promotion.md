From [AI is wrestling with a replication crisis](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/12/1011944/artificial-intelligence-replication-crisis-science-big-tech-google-deepmind-facebook-openai/) (HT: [Drew Conry-Murray](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewconrymurray/))

> Last month Nature published a damning response written by 31 scientists to a study from Google Health that had appeared in the journal earlier this year. Google was describing successful trials of an AI that looked for signs of breast cancer in medical images. But according to its critics, **the Google team provided so little information about its code and how it was tested that the study amounted to nothing more than a promotion of proprietary tech** (emphasis mine).

No surprise there, we've [seen it before](/2018/03/before-commenting-on-someone-mentioning/) (not to mention the "_look how awesome we are, but we can't tell you the details_" [Jupiter Rising article](https://research.google/pubs/pub43837/)).
