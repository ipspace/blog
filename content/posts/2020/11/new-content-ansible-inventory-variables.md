When restructuring our [online courses](https://www.ipspace.net/Courses) we decided to make the video content that was previously part of Ansible online course available with [Standard ipSpace.net Subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/). 

If you haven’t enrolled into our [automation online course](https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions) (which always included the extra bits) you’ll find the following additional content in our [Ansible for Networking Engineers](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Ansible) webinar:
<!--more-->
- [Debugging Ansible playbooks and Jinja2 templates](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Ansible#DEBUGGING)
- [Sample playbook](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Ansible#SAMPLES): collect SSH keys from network devices
- Case study: store network device configurations into a Git repository
- Case study: create network diagram with Ansible and Graphviz
- [WAN services deployment case study](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Ansible#WAN_SVC_CS)

We also added new material explaining [Ansible inventory and variables in more details](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Ansible#ANSIBLE_DD), including YAML-formatted inventories, fact caching, and a deep dive into Ansible special (and magic) variables… and I couldn’t resist updating the introductory videos &#x1F601;

{{<note>}}We made no other changes automation course content - you can access it after registering for course, or when choosing the course as part of your Expert subscription.{{</note>}}
