After (hopefully) [agreeing on what routing, bridging, and switching are](https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/09/video-bridging-routing-switching.html), let's focus on the first important topic in this area: how do we get a packet across the network? Yet again, there are three fundamentally different technologies:

* Source node knows the full path (source routing)
* Source node opened a path (virtual circuit) to the destination node and uses that path to send traffic
* The network performs hop-by-hop destination-address-based packet forwarding.
