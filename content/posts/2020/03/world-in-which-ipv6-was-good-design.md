A lot of people are confused about the [roles of network layers](https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/09/response-osi-model-is-lie.html) ([some more than others](https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/03/omg-what-is-layer-2.html)), the interactions between MAC addresses, IP addresses, and TCP/UDP port numbers, the [differences between routing and bridging](https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/07/is-fibre-channel-switching-bridging-or.html)... and why [it's so bad to bridge across large distances ](https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/02/live-vmotion-into-vmware-on-aws-cloud.html)(or in large networks).

I tried to explain most of those topic in [How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work) webinar (next session coming on April 2nd), but as is usually the case someone did a much better job: you MUST READ the poetic and hilariously funny [World in which IPv6 was a good design](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20170810) by [Avery Pennarun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/apenwarr/).
