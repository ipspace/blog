<p>After decades of riding the Moore’s law curve the networking bandwidth should be (almost) infinite and (almost) free, right? WRONG, as I explained in the <em><a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/F2.3%20-%20Bandwidth%20Is%20%28Not%29%20Infinite%20and%20Free.mp4?doccode=Net101">Bandwidth Is (Not) Infinite and Free</a></em> video (part of <em><a href="https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work">How Networks Really Work</a></em> webinar).</p>
<p>There are still pockets of Internet desert where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cap">mobile- or residential users have to deal with traffic caps</a>, and if you decide to move your applications into any public cloud you better check how much bandwidth those applications consume or you’ll be the next victim of the <a href="http://blog.thestateofme.com/2019/12/12/the-great-bandwidth-swindle/">Great Bandwidth Swindle</a>.
