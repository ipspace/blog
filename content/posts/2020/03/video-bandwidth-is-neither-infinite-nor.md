After decades of riding Moore's law curve, the networking bandwidth should be (almost) infinite and (almost) free, right? WRONG, as I explained in the *[Bandwidth Is (Not) Infinite and Free](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/F2.3%20-%20Bandwidth%20Is%20%28Not%29%20Infinite%20and%20Free.mp4?doccode=Net101)* video (part of *[How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work)* webinar).

There are still pockets of Internet desert where [mobile- or residential users have to deal with traffic caps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cap). If you decide to move your applications into any public cloud you better check how much bandwidth those applications consume, or you'll be the next victim of the [Great Bandwidth Swindle](http://blog.thestateofme.com/2019/12/12/the-great-bandwidth-swindle/), for more details, [watch the video](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/F2.3%20-%20Bandwidth%20Is%20%28Not%29%20Infinite%20and%20Free.mp4?doccode=Net101).
