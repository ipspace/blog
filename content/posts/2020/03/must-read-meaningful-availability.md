Defining service availability using the [famous X nines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability#%22Nines%22) (and all the hacks like "planned downtime doesn't count") is pretty useless in a highly distributed system where the only thing that really matters is the user experience, not ping response times. One should ask *what precisely should we be measuring, and how could we make sure we can act on the measurements*

More details in a [concise analysis](https://blog.acolyer.org/2020/02/26/meaningful-availability/) of the [Meaningful Availability paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_hauer_prepub.pdf) by the one-and-only [The Morning Paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/).
