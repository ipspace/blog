When I've seen my good friends [Christopher Werny](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Christopher_Werny) and Enno Rey talk about IPv6 security at RIPE78 meeting, another bit of one of my puzzles fell in place. I was planning to do an update of the [IPv6 security webinar](https://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_security) I'd done with [Eric Vyncke](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Eric_Vyncke), and always wanted to get it done by a security practitioner focused on enterprise networks, making Christopher a perfect fit.

As it was almost a decade since we did the original webinar, Christopher started with an [overview of IPv6 security challenges ](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/IPv6Sec/E1%20-%20IPv6%20Security%20Overview.mp4?doccode=IPv6Sec)(TL&DR: not much has changed).
