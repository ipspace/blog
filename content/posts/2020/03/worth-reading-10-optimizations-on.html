<p>Stumbled upon an <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2984631">article by Tom Limoncelli</a>. He starts with a programming question (skip that) but then goes into an interesting discussion of what’s really important.</p>
<p>Being focused primarily on networking this is the bit I liked most (another case of <em><a href="/2020/02/video-end-to-end-latency-is-not-zero.html">Latency Matters</a></em>):</p>
<blockquote><p>I once observed a situation where a developer was complaining that an operation was very slow. His solution was to demand a faster machine. The sysadmin who investigated the issue found that the code was downloading millions of data points from a database on another continent. The network between the two hosts was very slow. A faster computer would not improve performance. <p>The solution, however, was not to build a faster network, either. Instead, we moved the calculation to be closer to the data.</p>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lesson learned: always figure out the real problem and what the most effective way of solving it as opposed to <a href="/2013/04/this-is-what-makes-networking-so-complex.html">pushing the problem down the stack</a> or <a href="/2020/02/the-myth-of-scaling-from-on-premises.html">into the cloud</a>.</p>
