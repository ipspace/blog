title: What Data Center Switches Should I Buy with VMware NSX?

---

<p>Another interesting question I got from an ipSpace.net subscriber:</p>
<blockquote><p>Assuming we can simplify the physical network when using overlay virtual network solutions like VMware NSX, do we really need datacenter switches (example: Cisco Nexus instead of Catalyst product line) to implement the underlay?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s recap what we <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/02/do-we-need-complex-data-center-switches.html">really need to run VMware NSX</a>:<!--more--></p>
<ul><li>Multiple VRFs;</li>
<li>VLANs stretched across at least two ToR switches (or IP host routing hacks), potentially combined with MLAG.</li>
<li>Jumbo frames to support NSX-generated VXLAN packets carrying full-sized Ethernet frames.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next question: how big is your fabric?</p>
<p>If you’re small enough for <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=BCloud#2SWITCHES">two switches</a>, go with a solution that uses two independent switches - you really don’t want to run your whole infrastructure on a glorified stackable switch (regardless of whether it’s called VSS, IRF or VCF). Also, keep it as simple as possible - kick out any vendor that <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/02/using-evpn-in-very-small-data-center.html">tries to sell you VXLAN with EVPN and BGP</a>.</p>
<p>If you need more than two switches, you’ll have to build a fabric (I would opt for a leaf-and-spine fabric) that supports multiple VRFs and VLANs spanning more than one ToR switch. As <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/11/the-evpn-dilemma.html">most vendors abandoned the proprietary fabric craze</a>, you have two options:</p>
<ul><li>Traditional bridging with leaf-to-spine MLAG;</li>
<li>VXLAN-based overlay networking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last time I looked at my calendar it was 2020. Maybe we should <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/03/should-i-go-with-vxlan-or-mlag-with-stp.html">stop using the MLAG+STP hacks</a> even when you find them in <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/05/dont-base-your-design-on-vendor.html">old vendor marketing materials</a>.</p>
<p>To recap - you’re looking for switches that:</p>
<ul><li>Do MLAG with independent control planes;</li>
<li>Support multiple VRFs;</li>
<li>Support VXLAN-based layer-2 transport;</li>
<li>(Optionally) Have EVPN control plane.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have a list of requirements, it should be easy to figure out what switches meet them.

<p class="update">2020-03-11: Added <strong>jumbo frames</strong> requirement based on feedback from Jerome Catrouillet. Thank you!</p>
