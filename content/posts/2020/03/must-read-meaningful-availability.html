<p>Defining service availability using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability#%22Nines%22">famous X nines</a> (and all the hacks like “planned downtime doesn’t count”) is pretty useless in a highly distributed system where the only thing that really matters is the user experience, not ping response times.
