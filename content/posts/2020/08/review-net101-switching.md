One of the most annoying part in every training content development project was the ubiquitous question somewhere at the end of the process: "_and now we'd need a few review questions_". I'm positive anyone ever involved in a similar project can feel the pain that question causes...

Writing good review questions requires a particularly devious state of mind, sometimes combined with "_I would really like to get the answer to this one_" (obviously you'd mark such questions as "_needs further research_", and if you're [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) the question would be "_prove that P != NP_").

Now imagine [generating over 170 challenging review questions](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/RQ-Switching.md?doccode=Net101) out of 4-hour content. That's exactly what [Miha Markočič](https://www.ipspace.net/Team:Miha_Markocic) managed to do when I asked him to write "_a few_" questions covering the [Switching, Routing and Bridging](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Net101#SWITCH) part of [How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work) webinar.
