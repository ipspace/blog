Brett Lykins published an excellent description of 
[what an automation Minimum Viable Product could be](https://blog.networktocode.com/post/netdevops-concepts-mvp/). 

Not surprisingly, he's almost perfectly in sync with what we've been telling networking engineers in [ipSpace.net Network Automation online course](https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions):

* Go for quick wins
* Do read-only stuff before modifying device configurations
* Test, test, test...
