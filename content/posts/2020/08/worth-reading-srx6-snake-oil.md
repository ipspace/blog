I wanted to write a "_SRv6 makes ~~no~~ little sense_" blog post for a long while, but there were always more relevant topics to focus on. Fortunately I won't have to write it anytime soon; [Ethan Banks](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Ethan_Banks) did a fantastic job with [SR(x)6 - Snake Oil Or Salvation?](https://packetpushers.net/srx6-snake-oil-or-salvation/). Make sure you read it before attending the next "_SRx6 will save the world_" vendor presentation.
