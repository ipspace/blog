The _can we trust routing protocols_ series of blog posts I wrote in April 2020 ([part 1](/2020/04/can-we-trust-bgp-next-hops-part-1.html), [part 2](/2020/04/can-we-trust-bgp-next-hops-part-2.html), [response from Jeff Tantsura](/2020/04/next-hop-vtep-reachability-evpn.html)) culminated in an interesting discussion with Russ White and Nick Russo now published as [The Hedge Episode 43](https://rule11.tech/the-hedge-pdocast-episode-43-ivan-pepelnjak-and-trusting-routing-protocols/).
