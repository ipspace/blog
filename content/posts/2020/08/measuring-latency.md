A while ago someone pointed me to an [interesting talk explaining why 99th percentile represents a pretty good approximation of user-experienced latency on a typical web page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ8ydIuPFeU) (way longer version: [Understanding Latency and Application Responsiveness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpBwt-rO07o), also [How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Misery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fiV3JUXylM))

If you prefer reading instead of watching videos, there's also [everything you know about latency is wrong](https://bravenewgeek.com/everything-you-know-about-latency-is-wrong/).
