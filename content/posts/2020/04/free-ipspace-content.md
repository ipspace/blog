Most of us are in some sort of lockdown (or quarantine or shelter-in-place or whatever it's called) at the moment. Some have their hands full balancing work and homeschooling their kids (hang in there!), others are getting bored and looking for networking-related content (or you wouldn't be reading this blog).

If you're in the latter category you might want to browse some of the [free ipSpace.net content](https://www.ipspace.net/Free):   [almost 3500 blog posts](/), [dozens of articles](/kb), over a hundred [podcast episodes](https://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild/), over [20 free webinars](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free), and another 30+ webinars with sample videos that you can [access with free subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free).

Need more? [Standard subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/) includes 260 hours of video content and if you go for [Expert subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual) and select the [network automation course](https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions) as part of the subscription, you'll get another 60 hours of content plus hands-on exercises, support, access to Slack team... hopefully enough to last you way past the peak of the current pandemic.
