Being stuck at home like most everyone else we're continuing the increased pace of content production in May 2020:

* I'll continue the [Introduction to Containers and Docker](https://www.ipspace.net/Docker101) update. We got through the basics the last time and will cover Linux namespaces and how Docker uses them on May 5th.
* We finally found an independent guest speaker familiar with Cisco ACI. [Mario Rosi](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Mario_Rosi) will start the Cisco ACI series with an [introductory webinar](https://www.ipspace.net/Cisco_ACI_Introduction) on May 12th.
* [Dinesh Dutt](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Dinesh_Dutt) will continue his [Network Automation Tools](https://www.ipspace.net/NetTools) update on May 19th.
* Hoping to get through _Introduction to Docker_ on May 5th, I plan to do a deep dive into Docker Networking on May 26.
* Finally, I'm positive I won't cover all the [bridging and routing material](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work) I created in today's webinar, so we'll continue with routing protocol basics on May 28th.
