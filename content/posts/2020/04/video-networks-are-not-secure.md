It's amazing how many people still believe in Security Fairy (the mythical entity that makes your application magically secure), fueling the whole industry of security researchers who happily create [excruciatingly detailed talks of how you can use whatever security oversight to wreak havoc](https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/11/omg-vxlan-is-still-insecure.html) (even when the [limitations of a technology are clearly spelled out in an RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7348#section-7)).

In the _[Networks Are Not Secure](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/F2.4%20-%20Networks%20Are%20%28Not%29%20Secure.mp4?doccode=Net101)_ (part of _[How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work)_ webinar) I described why we should never rely on network infrastructure to provide security, but have to implement it higher up in the application stack.
