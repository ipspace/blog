Every time I'm [complaining about the stupidities $vendors are trying to sell us](/2020/02/live-vmotion-into-vmware-on-aws-cloud/), someone from vendorland saddles a high horse and starts telling me how I got it all wrong, for example:

> It is a duty of a pre-sales, consultant, vendor representative to inform the customer about the risk.

When you stop laughing (maybe it was just April Fools' joke ;), here's how the reality of that process looks like (straight from one of my readers):

> I remember when the VM guys and their managers were telling me (like they had discovered the solutions to all of ours problems) about "with VXLAN we can move a machine from one country to another, and keep having service with the same IP" ... while looking at me with the "I'm so smart" face... and me thinking shit... I'm doomed :) ... I don't even want to start explaining ... but in the long run I had to anyway.
