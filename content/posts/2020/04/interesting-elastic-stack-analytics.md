[Adrian Giacometti](https://adriangiacometti.net/index.php/about-adrian/) described how he [used Elastic Stack (ELK) to build a dashboard for his integration tests and network logs](https://adriangiacometti.net/index.php/2020/04/05/free_analytics_with_elk/).

Maybe it's time to build our own network monitoring systems from open-source components instead of paying vendors big bucks for slick PowerPoint slides.
