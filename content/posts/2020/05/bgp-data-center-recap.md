Got mentioned in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/vpackets/status/1253371082788220929?s=11) a while ago:

> Watching @ApstraInc youtube stream regarding BGP in the DC with @doyleassoc and @jtantsura.Maybe BGP is getting bigger and bigger traction from big enterprise data centers but I still see an IGP being used frequently. I am eager to have @ioshints opinion on that hot subject.

Maybe I've missed some breaking news, but assuming I haven't my opinion on that subject hasn't changed.

I've been writing, talking, and teaching about various aspects of using BGP in data center fabrics (including "do we really need it") for over five years, and I know it's hard to collect all that information, so I did it for you: ipSpace.net [BGP in Data Center Fabrics resource page](https://www.ipspace.net/kb/tag/BGP-DC.html).

As for the hotness of the topic: 

* It was hot when [Petr Lapukhov presented the first idea at NANOG](https://archive.nanog.org/sites/default/files/wed.general.brainslug.lapukhov.20.pdf) in 2013 or [described how to build scalable data centers with BGP in May 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJbqnOdD3cg), but maybe not when a startup decides to use it to promote their product in 2020.
* It turned into a lemming run with many data center switching vendor [promoting it as the best thing invented since sliced bread](https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/11/bgp-as-better-igp-when-and-where.html).
* When [combined with EVPN on an old BGP code base](https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/02/the-evpnbgp-saga-continues.html) it usually gets so complex that you need an automation solution on top of it to stay sane (notable exception: FRRouting).

No wonder Apstra sees BGP-only data centers as a gift from networking gods ;)
