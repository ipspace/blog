The [third hands-on exercise](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=PubCloud&module=3#HOMEWORK) in our [Networking in Public Cloud Deployments](https://www.ipspace.net/PubCloud/) online course asks the students to deploy a web server in a public cloud of their choice using infrastructure-as-code principles.

Not surprisingly, [Erik Auerswald](https://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~auerswal/) created [another fantastic writeup](https://github.com/auerswal/pubcloud2020/tree/master/ex3-web) when solving that exercise, including _exploring the problem space_, detailed description of his Terraform-based solution, and testing procedures. Enjoy!
