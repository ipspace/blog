Loved the [article from Philip Laplante about environmental antipatterns](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1035617). I’ve seen plenty of *founderitis* and *shoeless children* in my life, but it was *worshipping the golden calf* that made me LOL:

> In any environment where there is poor vision or leadership, it is often convenient to lay one’s hopes on a technology or a methodology about which little is known, thereby providing a hope for some miracle. Since no one really understands the technology, methodology, or practice, it is difficult to dismiss. This is an environmental antipattern because it is based on a collective suspension of disbelief and greed, which couldn’t be sustained by one or a few individuals embracing the ridiculous.

That paragraph totally describes the belief in the magical powers of [long-distance vMotion](/2015/02/before-talking-about-vmotion-across.html), SDN (I published a whole book debunking its magical powers), [building networks like Google does it](/2016/03/you-want-your-network-to-be-like.html), [intent-based whatever](/2017/09/intent-based-hype.html), [machine learning](/2020/03/machine-learning-in-networking-products.html)…
