[Pete Lumbis](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Pete_Lumbis) started his [Cumulus Linux 4.0 update](https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics#Update_Sessions) with an overview of differences between Cumulus Linux on hardware switches and Cumulus VX, and continued with an in-depth list of ASIC families supported by Cumulus Linux.

You can watch his presentation, as well as the more in-depth overview of Cumulus Linux concepts by Dinesh Dutt, in the recently-updated [What Is Cumulus Linux All About](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/DCFabric/M80%20-%20What%20Is%20Cumulus%20Linux%20All%20About.mp4?doccode=DCFabric) video.
