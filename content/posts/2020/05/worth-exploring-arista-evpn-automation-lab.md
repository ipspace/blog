David Varnum created a [fantastic leaf-and-spine fabric of vEOS switches running with GNS3 and automated with Ansible playbooks](https://overlaid.net/2019/02/19/arista-bgp-evpn-ansible-lab/).

Not only that - his blog post includes detailed setup instructions, and the [corresponding GitHub repository](https://github.com/varnumd/ansible-arista-evpn-lab) contains all the source code you need to get it up and running.
