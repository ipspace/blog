[Mat Jovanovic](https://www.matscloud.com/about/) decided to [follow my lead](https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/03/ipspace-blog-runs-on-hugo.html) and migrate his blog from Blogger to Hugo, using Docsy theme, AWS Amplify as the CI/CD pipeline, and AWS S3 as the hosting platform.

Nice job... but he did way more than that - [he documented the whole process](https://www.matscloud.com/blog/2020/04/24/hugo-with-docsy-and-aws-amplify/), including tool selection, setup, and Blogger migration.

Thank you Mat! Every time I see someone publishing blog posts about open-source tools on Medium I'll send them a link to your blog (with a comment "_this is how you should blog about open-source solutions_").
