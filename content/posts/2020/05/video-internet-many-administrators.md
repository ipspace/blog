It's amazing how many people assume that The Internet is _a thing_, whereas in reality it's a mishmash of interconnected independent operators running mostly on goodwill, misplaced trust in other people's competence, and (sometimes) pure dumb luck. 

I described a few consequences of this sad reality in the _[Internet Has More than One Administrator](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/F2.5%20-%20Internet%20Has%20More%20than%20One%20Administrator.mp4?doccode=Net101)_ video (part of _[How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work)_ webinar), and Nick Buraglio and Elisa Jasinska provided even more details in their _[Surviving the Internet Default-Free Zone](https://www.ipspace.net/Surviving_the_Internet_Default_Free_Zone)_ webinar.
