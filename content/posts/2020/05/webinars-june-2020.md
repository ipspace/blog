Here's the final push before we hit the summer break at the end of June (and recover a bit from the [relentless production of new content](https://www.ipspace.net/Webinars/#Recent_webinars) we had throughout the first half of 2020):

* I finished the [Introduction to Containers and Docker](https://www.ipspace.net/Docker101) update just in time to cover the nuances of [Docker Networking](https://www.ipspace.net/Docker_Networking_Deep_Dive) before the summer break. The first live session will take place today, the second one on June 11th.
* Later this week (May 28th) we'll have some fun with [routing protocol basics](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work).
* [Dinesh Dutt](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Dinesh_Dutt) covered [Vagrant in his last live session](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetTools#SIMULATE) and plans to cover [other network simulation tools](https://www.ipspace.net/NetTools) on June 2nd.
* We did a "_[should I use VMware NSX or Cisco ACI](https://www.ipspace.net/VMware_NSX,_Cisco_ACI_or_Standard-Based_EVPN)_" webinar a few years ago. In the meantime both vendors launched major new features, so it's high time for a [thorough refresh](https://www.ipspace.net/VMware_NSX,_Cisco_ACI_or_Standard-Based_EVPN) starting on June 9th.
* [Mario Rosi](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Mario_Rosi) will continue the [Cisco ACI Introduction](https://www.ipspace.net/Cisco_ACI_Introduction) series on June 16th.
* David Barroso [described the basics of Nornir](https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions#DB18) in our [network automation course](https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions). We'll turn that material into an [independent webinar](https://www.ipspace.net/Nornir) (available with [standard ipSpace.net subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/)) and David plans to augment it with a deep dive into Nornir internals in a live session on June 18th.
* I will need another live session on June 23rd to continue the NSX-or-ACI comparison, and we plan to start the summer break on June 25th.
