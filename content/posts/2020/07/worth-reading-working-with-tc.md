Here's one of the weirdest ideas I've found recently: [patch together two dangling ends of virtual Ethernet cables with PBR](http://www.dasblinkenlichten.com/working-with-tc-on-linux-systems/). 

To be fair, Jon Langemak used that example to demonstrate how powerful **tc** could be. It's always fun to see a totally-unexpected aspect of Linux networking... even though it looks like the creators of those tools believed in Perl mentality of [creating a gazillion variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it) of [line noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-only_language) to get the job done.
