Got sick and tired of conference keynotes? You might love the [Lies, Damned Lies, and Keynotes](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/lies-damned-lies-and-keynotes/) rant by Corey Quinn. Here are just two snippets:

> They’re selling a fantasy, and you’ve been buying it all along.

> We’re lying to ourselves. But it feels better than the unvarnished truth.

Enjoy!
