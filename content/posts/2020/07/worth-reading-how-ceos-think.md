Robert Graham wrote a great article [explaining why CEOs don't care much about cybersecurity](https://blog.erratasec.com/2020/07/how-ceos-think.html) or any other non-core infrastructure (including networking, unless you happen to be working for a service provider). It's a must-read if you want to understand the **** you have to deal with in enterprise environments.
