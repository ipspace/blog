In mid-September, Carl Buchmann, Fred Hsu, and Thomas Grimonet had an excellent presentation describing [Arista's Ansible roles and collections](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutUC#CS_EOS). They focused on two collections: [CloudVision integration](https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-cvp), and [Arista Validated Designs](https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd). All the videos from that presentation are available with [free ipSpace.net subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free).
