Carl Montanari recently published an interesting blog post on the [punditry of network APIs](https://www.montanari.io/posts/2020/on_the_punditry_of_network_apis/) (including hilarious fact that "_SNMP is also an API_"), and as someone sent me a link to that post he commented "_it reminds me of a few blog posts you wrote a while ago_". 

Speaking of those blog posts... last July I was getting bored and put together a [list of interesting blog posts I published on that topic](https://www.ipspace.net/kb/tag/cli-or-api.html). Enjoy!
