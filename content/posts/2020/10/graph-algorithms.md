After a bit more than a year, we ran another math-focused webinar last week: [Rachel Traylor](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Rachel_Traylor) came back to [talk about graph algorithms](https://www.ipspace.net/Graph_Algorithms_in_Networks), focusing on tree-, path- and center problems.

In her lecture you'll find:

* maximum branching algorithms (and I couldn't stop wondering why we don't use them for OSPF- or IS-IS flooding)
* path algorithms including the ones used in OSPF, IS-IS, or BGP, as well as algorithms that find K shortest paths
* center problems (for example: where do I put my streaming server or my BGP route reflector)

You'll need [Standard or Expert ipSpace.net subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual) to [watch the videos](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Algorithms).
