[James Miles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-m-974903a0/) got tons of really interesting questions while watching the [Network Operating System Models](https://www.ipspace.net/Network_Operating_System_Models) webinar by [Dinesh Dutt](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Dinesh_Dutt), and the only reasonable thing to do when he sent them over  was to schedule a Q&A session with Dinesh to discuss them.

We got together last week and planned to spend an hour or two discussing the questions, but (not exactly unexpectedly) we got only halfway through the list in the time we had, so we're continuing next week.

[This is how far we've got](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NOSModels#DDNOS):
<!--more-->
* What exactly is an operating system, and why do we need one?
* Are network operating systems special, and if so, why?
* How do network operating systems integrate with switching ASICs?
* How exactly is that integration done if you're using Linux-based network operating system (Cisco NX-OS, Arista EOS, Cumulus Linux, SONiC)?
* How would you compare different network operating systems... and why would you consider Junos to be better than Cisco IOS?

For whatever reason we couldn't avoid getting pulled down the  "_virtual machines versus containers_" rabbit hole, but it was definitely an interesting detour that we'll use next week when discussing virtualized network devices.
