My friend Marjan Brade≈°ko wrote a great article [describing how we tend to forget common sense and rely too much on technology](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/does-your-hammer-own-you-marjan-bradesko/). I would strongly recommend you read it and start thinking about the choices you make when building a network with magic software-intent-defined-intelligent technology from your preferred vendor.
