In mid-September Ethan Banks invited me to [chat about multi-cloud networking](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/day-two-cloud-070-the-state-of-multi-cloud-networking/) in the [Day Two Cloud podcast](https://packetpushers.net/series/day2cloud/). It was just a few weeks after Corey Quinn published a fantastic _[Multi-Cloud is the Worst Practice](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/multi-cloud-is-the-worst-practice/)_ rant, which perfectly matched my observations, so I came well prepared ;)
