The designers of Cumulus Linux CLI were always focused on simplifying network device configurations. One of the first features along these lines was [BGP across unnumbered interfaces](https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/02/bgp-configuration-made-simple-with.html), then they introduced simplified EVPN configurations, and recently [auto-MLAG and auto-BGP](https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/10/auto-mlag-and-auto-bgp-in-cumulus-linux.html).

You can watch a short description of these features by [Dinesh Dutt](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Dinesh_Dutt) and [Pete Lumbis](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Pete_Lumbis) in [Simplify Network Configuration with Cumulus Linux](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/DCFabric/M83%20-%20Simplify%20Network%20Configuration%20with%20Cumulus%20Linux.mp4?doccode=DCFabric) and [Smart Datacenter Defaults](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/DCFabric/M83A%20-%20Smart%20Datacenter%20Defaults.mp4?doccode=DCFabric) videos (part of [Cumulus Linux](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DCFabric#CUMULUS) section of [Data Center Fabrics](https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics) webinar).
