While I keep telling you that [Google-sized solutions aren't necessarily the best fit for your environment](/2020/03/the-stupidity-of-trying-to-be-like.html), some of the hyperscaler presentations contain nuggets that apply to any environment no matter how small it is.

One of those must-watch presentations is [Fault Tolerance through Optimal Workload Placement](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=332024971479280&extid=Y9TkZOeMqLFHeDOv) together with a  wonderful [TL&DR summary](http://highscalability.com/blog/2020/9/22/snakes-in-a-facebook-datacenter.html) by the one-and-only [Todd Hoff](https://twitter.com/toddhoffious) of the High Scalability fame.
