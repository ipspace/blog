A few weeks ago we [published an interesting discussion on network operating system details](https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/10/network-operating-systems-qa.html) based on an excellent set of questions by [James Miles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-m-974903a0/).

Unfortunately we got so far into the weeds at that time that we answered only half of James' questions. In the second Q&A session [Dinesh Dutt](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Dinesh_Dutt) and myself [addressed the rest of them](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NOSModels#DDVIRT) including:

* How hard is it to virtualize network devices?
* What is the expected performance degradation?
* Does it make sense to use containers to do that?
* What are the operational implications of running virtual network devices?
* What will be the impact on hardware vendors and networking engineers?

And of course we couldn't avoid the famous _last question_: "_Should network engineers program network devices?_"
