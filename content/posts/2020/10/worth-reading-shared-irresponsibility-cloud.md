A long while ago I [wrote a blog post along the lines of](/2014/05/its-ok-to-let-developers-go-amazon-web/) "_it's ridiculous to allow developers to deploy directly to a public cloud while burdening them with all sorts of crazy barriers when deploying to an on-premises infrastructure_," effectively arguing for self-service approach to on-premises deployments.

Not surprisingly, the reality is grimmer than I expected (I'm appalled at how optimistic my predictions are even though I always come across as a die-hard grumpy pessimist), as explained in [The Shared Irresponsibility Model in the Cloud](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud/the-shared-irresponsibility-model-in-the-cloud-is-putting-you-at-risk/a/d-id/1338940) by Dan Hubbard.
