<p>After <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/01/video-fallacies-of-distributed-computing.html">introducing the fallacies of distributed computing</a> in the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work">How Networks Really Work</a> webinar, I focused on the first one: <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/F2.1%20-%20Network%20Is%20%28Not%29%20Reliable.mp4?doccode=Net101">the network is (not) reliable</a>.</p>
<p>While that might be understood by most networking professionals (and ignored by many developers), here’s an interesting shocker: even TCP is not always reliable (see also: <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">Joel Spolsky’s take on Leaky Abstractions</a>).</p>
