<p>After my response to the <a href="/2019/11/facts-and-fiction-bgp-is-hot-mess.html"><em>BGP is a hot mess</em> topic</a>, <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/about/">Corey Quinn</a> graciously invited me to discuss BGP issues on his podcast. It took us a long while to set it up, but we eventually got there… and the <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/aws-morning-brief/networking-in-the-cloud-fundamentals-bgp-revisited-with-ivan-pepelnjak/">results were published last week</a>. Hope you’ll enjoy our chat.</p>

I’ll cover similar topics in the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Upcoming_Internet_Challenges">Upcoming Internet Challenges webinar</a>. </div>
