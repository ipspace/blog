<p>Dinesh Dutt, a <a href="/2018/08/is-bgp-good-enough-with-dinesh-dutt-on/">pragmatic IP routing guru</a>, the mastermind behind <a href="/2015/02/bgp-configuration-made-simple-with/">great concepts like simplified BGP configuration</a>, and <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Dinesh_Dutt">one of the best ipSpace.net authors</a>, finally decided to start blogging.
