<p>Starting with a short message to anyone interested in our on-site events in Switzerland: on March 10th we’re running our <a href="https://www.sig-switzerland.ch/docker/">first 2020 workshop, focusing on Docker and containers</a>.</p>
<p>I totally reworked the material, adding tons of new Docker networking examples (including deep dive into <strong>iptables</strong>) and a few fun things like building an Ansible container, or starting the whole NetBox stack with a single command. Even if you don’t plan to deploy containers in your production network, you might drop by just for that part.</p>
<p>And now for the upcoming webinars:<!--more--></p>
