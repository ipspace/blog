After the "shocking" revelation that [a network can never be totally reliable](/2020/02/video-network-is-not-reliable.html), I addressed another widespread lack of common sense: due to laws of physics, [the client-server latency is never zero](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/F2.2%20-%20Latency%20Is%2%28Not%29%20Zero.mp4?doccode=Net101) (and never even close to what a developer gets from the laptop's loopback interface).
