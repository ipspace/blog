<p>Considering VMware’s <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/09/vmotion-enhancements-in-vsphere.html">enrapturement with vMotion</a> the following news (<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/01/youre-responsible-for-resiliency-of.html?showComment=1580417029396#c5624129873759076242">reported by Salman Naqvi in a comment to my blog post</a>) was clearly inevitable:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was surprised to learn that <a href="https://cloud.vmware.com/vmc-aws/faq#workload-migration">LIVE vMotion is supported between on-premise and Vmware on AWS Cloud</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What’s more interesting is <em>how did they manage to do it?</em><!--more--></p>
<p>A few basics first:</p>
<ul><li>VMware-on-AWS has little to do with AWS or public cloud. It’s a vSphere/NSX-T/VSAN cluster managed by VMware and running on AWS bare-metal servers. The only difference between VMware-on-AWS and a vSphere cluster running in any collocation facility is that they had to cope with the fact that <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/01/there-is-no-layer-2-in-public-cloud.html">AWS doesn’t care about layer-2 tricks</a>.</li>
<li>VMware-on-AWS runs NSX-T, so the question really becomes “<em>how do you do a vMotion between two NSX-T instances or between a traditional vSphere cluster and an NSX-T instance?</em>”</li>
</ul>
<p>Since VMware introduced cross-vCenter vMotion, it’s easy to migrate a running virtual machine across multiple vCenter deployments… all you need is a matching port group name on both ends, and end-to-end layer-2 connectivity if you expect the virtual machine to keep communicating with its environment.</p>
<p>The “magic” of live vMotion to VMware-on-AWS thus boils down to “<em>how do I get layer-2 connectivity into AWS?</em>”. Well, you don’t - AWS is not stupid enough to allow you to bring your flooding challenges into their environment… but there’s always <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/12/where-would-you-need-gre.html">the duct-tape-of-networking</a>.</p>
<p>NSX-T includes L2VPN - bridging across an IPsec-protected GRE tunnel. Hooray, problem solved. You might experience MTU issues I was told (and that’s probably why they want you to have a DirectConnect link into AWS), but who cares about such minor inconveniences when you can do what everyone always wanted: move a running server into AWS.</p>
<p>You probably know my opinion on the feasibility of <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/02/before-talking-about-vmotion-across.html">long-distance vMotion</a>, long-distance bridging and L2 DCI, and the latest VMware’s trick didn’t change it a bit. If anything, the L2 DCI features they’re offering in NSX-T release 2.5 are worse than what Cisco had in OTV a decade ago</p>
<div class="note" data-markdown="1">I’m not saying that you should do L2 DCI or endorsing OTV, but if you absolutely want to do crazy things, at least do them right. </div>
<p><strong>Long story short</strong>: the only advice I can give you regarding this marketing gimmick is what <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/10/worth-watching-machine-learning-in.html">James Mickens told people enchanted with the promise of ML/AL</a>:</p>
<ul><li>In three words: Think before deploying.</li>
<li>In two words: Think first.</li>
<li>In one word: Don’t.</li>
</ul>
