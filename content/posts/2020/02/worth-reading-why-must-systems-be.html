<p>Every now and then I find an IT professional claiming <a href="/2012/10/if-something-can-fail-it-will/">we should not be worried about split-brain scenarios because you have redundant links</a>.</p>
<p>I might understand that sentiment coming from software developers, but I also encountered it when <a href="/2015/10/sometimes-you-have-to-decide-how-badly/">discussing stretched clusters</a> or even SDN controllers deployed across multiple data centers.</p>
<p>Finally I found a great analogy you might find useful. A reader of my blog pointed me to the awesome <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2016/01/03/correlation.html">Why Must Systems Be Operated</a> blog post explaining the same problem from the storage perspective, so the next time you might want to use this one: “<em>so you’re saying you don’t need backup because you have RAID disks</em>”. If someone agrees with that, don’t walk away… RUN!</p>
