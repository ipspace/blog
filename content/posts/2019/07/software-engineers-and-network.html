<p>I was saying “<em>you’ll get the best network automation (or SDN) results if you pair network engineers with software engineers</em>” for ages, but there’s always someone else saying it more eloquently, in this case Jeremy Schulman in his <a href="https://medium.com/@jeremy.schulman/https-technology-mlblogs-com-hire-sweng-for-networking-2158756e80b9">recent blog post</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions#JS19">Jeremy will talk about ChatOps</a> in Autumn 2019 <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course, but of course you’re more than welcome to ask him other questions as well.</p>
