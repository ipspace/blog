<p>I was listening to a <a href="https://thenetworkcollective.com/2019/06/bgp-blunder/">nice podcast with Nick Buraglio</a> discussing the recent BGP hijack SNAFU impacting Cloudflare (and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-verizon-and-a-bgp-optimizer-knocked-large-parts-of-the-internet-offline-today/">their reaction</a>) and while I usually totally agree with Nick, I think that he tried to be way too nice when saying (paraphrasing) “I think Cloudflare was a bit harsh - I would prefer a more community-oriented approach along the lines of <em>how could we help you do your job better</em>”<!--more--></p>
<p>That response would be totally appropriate for a small customer who cobbled their BGP configuration from google-and-paste results (don’t get me started), or for a small ISP that can barely keep afloat, but the SNAFU generator in this particular instance was Verizon, a NYSE-traded ISP with decades of experience.</p>
<div class="note">CloudFlare being unable to reach Verizon for eight hours probably didn’t improve their mood...</div>
<p>Also, it’s not like they were hit by a particularly insidious BGP bug (like the overly-long AS path crashing Cisco IOS, or unknown BGP attributes crashing another BGP implementation). They didn’t have a single mechanism in place that would prevent a fat-finger customer from bringing down their core routing.</p>
<p>Even worse, numerous mechanisms they could have used were known for decades - we’re not talking about RPKI or BGPsec but simple stuff like “don’t accept transit prefixes from your customers” and “limit the number of prefixes you accept from a customer”. Most of them are documented in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7454">Best Current Practice 194</a> (RFC 7454), and it’s just the matter of figuring them out and implementing them consistently... which brings me to the root problem.</p>
<p>I’m somewhat naive and believe that Verizon has enough great engineers and in-house BGP knowledge to (almost) guarantee the SNAFU was not caused by technical incompetence, but gross management-level negligence... and there’s only one way to fight that: on the stock market.</p>
<p>Time for a campfire story... A few years ago numerous European ISPs pretended they didn’t need IPv6. Head-in-the-sand strategy worked for most of them, but at least one got a rude awakening when an analyst asked the CEO about their IPv6 strategy on a quarterly results call. </p>
<p>So all we need to make Internet a slightly more secure place is industry analysts asking “what is your strategy to stop BGP hijacks from affecting your customers” on earning calls. Will it happen? This is where I usually stop being an optimist...</p>
