<p>A long while ago I published my solution for <a href="https://github.com/ipspace/MPLS-infrastructure">automated L3VPN provisioning</a>… and I’m really glad I can point you to a much better one ;)</p>
<p>Håkon Rørvik Aune decided to tackle the same challenge as his hands-on assignment in the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> course and created a <a href="https://github.com/hraune/net-automation/tree/master/L3VPN">nicely-structured and well-documented solution</a> (after creating a playbook that <a href="https://github.com/hraune/net-automation/tree/master/reporting">creates network diagrams from OSPF neighbor information</a>).</p>
<p>Want to be able to do something similar? You missed the Spring 2019 online course, but you can get the mentored self-paced version with <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual">Expert Subscription</a>.</p>
