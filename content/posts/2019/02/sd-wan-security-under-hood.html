<p>A while ago we published a guest blog post by <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Christoph_Jaggi">Christoph Jaggi</a> explaining the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/08/security-aspects-of-sd-wan-solutions.html">high-level security challenges of most SD-WAN solutions</a>… but what about the low-level details?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scada.sl/">Sergey Gordeychik</a> dived deep into implementation details of SD-WAN security in his 35C3 talk (<a href="https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/system/event_attachments/attachments/000/003/661/original/SD-WAN_-_35C3_-_publish.pdf">slides</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfn2Q0sDqOY">video</a>).</p>
<p>TL&amp;DW: some of the SD-WAN boxes are as secure as $19.99 Chinese webcam you bought on eBay.<!--more--></p>
<p>Even more fun: you’ll find some of the worst offenders as <em>leaders</em> in the Gartner’s 2018 <a href="https://www.silver-peak.com/sd-wan-edge-gartner-magic-quadrant-2018">Magic Quadrant for WAN Edge Infrastructure</a>. Looks like cloudy visions and PowerPoint count more than quality of implementation.</p>
<p>However, we shouldn’t be surprised. What could you expect to happen when vendors that were good in a totally different technology area decide to “<em>explore the market adjacencies</em>” and buy digital camera manufacturer or slap together a bunch of outdated open-source software and call the hodgepodge software-defined.</p>
