<p>One of the rules of sane social media presence should be <em>donâ€™t ever engage with evangelists believing in a particular technology religion</em>, more so if their funding depends on them spreading the gospel. I was called <em>old-school networking guru from ivory tower</em><em> </em>when pointing out the drawbacks of TRILL, and clueless incompetent (in more polite words) when retweeting a tweet pointing out the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0152-7.epdf?referrer_access_token=b8g0sOJqPz65HBcolfhEiNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NdJEcpPQZqiP9V_5sRM6OFeEt1maRlkYa2rAMRc-x1aQl7SokzPBhFuBWBrHzSU7tcnIzqYuudsGiiO3PoitcCxNLtospps76D2sFti-sZ-HMZnq2hCX4SW3qNVCX-IwqjOIj56eyqVoooZl0vWGlbnO9tuA8vrlnpT-sha4iO-52WTQUurWpN0zy98oqtSKvE9ZqUbhI_d4CrbyvpMBLLTpggBRCxnZ9R4os6A9lYniNYFOBfVDf7jZCL3ocdpbjFOtHlqrEwlWnc0cg9t2Wb&amp;tracking_referrer=www.theguardian.com">realities of carbon footprint of proof-of-work technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, just a few days after that Bruce Schneier <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/02/blockchain_and_.html">published a lengthy essay on blockchain and trust</a>, and even the evangelists find it a bit hard to call him incompetent on security topics. Please read what he wrote every time someone comes along explaining how blockchains will save the world (or solve whatever networking problems like VTEP-to-MAC mappings).</p>
