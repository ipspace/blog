<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-boj-49474618/">Antonio Boj</a> sent me this interesting challenge:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Is there any way to avoid, prevent or at least mitigate bridging loops when using VXLAN with EVPN? Spanning-tree is not supported when using VXLAN encapsulation so I was hoping to use EVPN duplicate MAC detection.</blockquote>
<p>MAC move dampening (or anything similar) doesn’t help if you have a forwarding loop. You might be able to use it to identify there’s a loop, but that’s it… and while you’re doing that your network is melting down.<!--more--></p>
<p>As most hardware doesn’t support VXLAN-to-VXLAN bridging, it’s almost impossible to get bridging loop within VXLAN domain (though never say never), and if you implement <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/09/valley-free-routing-in-data-center.html">valley-free-routing design</a> you won’t get IP forwarding loops either. The IP transport backbone is thus pretty much loop-free.</p>
<p>Usually VXLAN Tunnel Endpoints (VTEPs) use automatic VXLAN-to-VLAN split horizon: whatever a switch gets from a VXLAN tunnel is only forwarded to corresponding VLAN, the only exception being <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Clos#MULTISITE">Cisco’s multi-site architecture</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of what you do in the network core, the VLAN edge ports have the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2016/03/spanning-tree-protocol-stp-and-bridging.html">real potential to mess up your network</a>, including the infamous “<em>let’s plug the TX fiber to RX to see if the cable is OK</em>” layer-1 troubleshooting and “<em>I wonder if I can solve the bonding on my Windows server by bridging the interfaces together</em>” approach favored by a CCIE friend of mine.</p>
<p>The only way to protect your network from those stupidities is to use the ancient protection mechanisms available in traditional bridged networks: make the edge switches (VTEPs) STP roots, turn on BPDU guard and root guard, enable storm control…</p>
<p>However, while the mechanisms to use on the edge ports haven’t changed with introduction of VXLAN, some of these features might not work for VLANs bridged into VXLAN. Carefully read the documentation and release notes before choosing the hardware infrastructure for your data center fabric… and whenever in doubt set up a lab and try to break it.
