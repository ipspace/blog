<p>Erik Dietrich (of the <a href="https://daedtech.com/tag/expert-beginner/">Expert Beginner</a> fame) published another great blog post <a href="https://daedtech.com/should-i-write-a-book/">explaining when and why you should write a book</a>. For the attention-challenged here’s my CliffNotes version:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Realize you have no idea what you’re doing (see also: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>)</li>
<li>Figure out why you’d want to spend a significant amount of your time on a major project like book writing;</li>
<li>It will take longer (and will be more expensive) than you expect even when considering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law">Hofstadter’s law</a>.</li>
</ul>
