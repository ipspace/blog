<p>I’m always amazed at how fast the time flies. I have no idea where May disappeared to, it seems like it was only yesterday when I was writing about <a href="/2019/01/webinars-plans-for-2019.html">webinar plans in 2019</a>… and yet it’s only a month till <a href="/2018/06/time-for-summer-break.html">ipSpace.net Summer Break</a>™.</p>
<p>During June 2019 I’ll continue updating <em></em><a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Designing_Private_Cloud_Infrastructure"><em></em><em></em><em>Designing the Private Cloud Infrastructure</em></a><em></em><em></em><em></em> webinar, and start a new pet project: <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work"><em>How Networks Really Work</em></a> – I’m literally minutes away from traveling to a quiet spot in the middle of nowhere where I’ll work on the materials. In between these webinars you’ll find me in Zurich where I’ll run <a href="https://www.sig-switzerland.ch/microsoft_azure_networking-2/"><em>Microsoft A</em><em>zure Networking</em></a> workshop on June 12<sup>th</sup> in parallel with <a href="https://www.sig-switzerland.ch/conference/sigs-technology-conference-2019/">SIGS Technology Conference</a>.</p>
<p>As you might expect we have plenty of things already lined up for autumn 2019… more about that in a week or two.</p>
