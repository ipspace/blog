<p>Topology changes are a bane of large STP-based networks, and when they become a serious challenge you could probably use a tool that could track down what’s causing them. </p>
<p>I’m sure there’s a network management tool out there that can do just that (please write a comment if you know one); <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eder-gernot-147b98120/">Eder Gernot</a> decided to <a href="https://github.com/edergernot/networkautomation">write his own</a> while working on a <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutSol&amp;module=2#M2S4">hands-on assignment</a> in the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course. Like most course attendees he <a href="https://github.com/edergernot/networkautomation">published the code on GitHub</a> and might appreciate pull requests ;)</p>
<p>Wonder what else course attendees created in the past? <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/NetAutSol/Solutions">Here’s a small sample</a>.</p>
