<p>One of the toughest challenges in the hands-on part of <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course is the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutSol&amp;module=3#M3S6">create a data model describing your service</a> exercise.</p>
<p>Networking engineers never had to think about data models describing their networks or services, and the first attempt often results in something that looks like simplified device configuration in YAML or JSON format.</p>
<p>I wrote a long article describing how you can slowly redesign your box-focused data model into a network-focused one. The first parts <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/kb/DataModels/">describing the problem</a> and <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/kb/DataModels/10-Removing%20Duplicate%20Data.html">initial deduplication</a> are <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/kb/DataModels/index.html">already online</a>.</p>
