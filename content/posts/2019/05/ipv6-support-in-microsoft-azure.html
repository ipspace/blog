<p>TL&amp;DR: MIA</p>
<p>Six years ago, when I was talking about overlay virtual networks at Interop, I loved to joke that we must be living on a weird planet where <em>Microsoft has the best overlay virtual networking implementation</em>… at least as far as IPv6 goes.</p>
<p>Even then, their data plane implementation which was fully dual-stack-aware on both tenant- and underlay level was way ahead of what System Center could do.<!--more--> If I remember correctly (and I’m positive <a href="https://twitter.com/ehorley">@ehorley</a> will be quick to correct me), you could configure either IPv4 or IPv6 but not dual-stack tenant networks.</p>
<p>Fast-forward six years. After completing the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Amazon_Web_Services_Networking">AWS Networking</a> webinar, I started preparing the materials for my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Microsoft_Azure_Networking_(Workshop)">Microsoft Azure Networking workshop</a>, expecting at least a parity with AWS as far as IPv6 goes. As my Twitter followers might have noticed I was bitterly disappointed. The only IPv6 functionality available in Azure is:</p>
<ul><li>Private IPv6 addresses on VM NICs;</li>
<li>Public IPv6 addresses on outside interfaces of load balancers;</li>
<li>Load balancing of incoming IPv6 traffic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Virtual machines can’t even communicate over IPv6, and needless to say there are no subnets, user-defined routes, network security groups… The state of IPv6 in Azure is best summarized by this “key benefit” from their documentation:</p>
<blockquote class="cite"><p>Meet government regulations requiring that new applications be accessible to IPv6-only clients</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To rephrase: <em>we have IPv6 so you can have a tick in the box</em>.</p>
<p>Compare that to AWS that has full feature parity between IPv4 and IPv6 in:</p>
<ul><li>Virtual networks;</li>
<li>Security groups;</li>
<li>Routing;</li>
<li>Internet access;</li>
<li>Load balancers.</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as I’d love to see a public infrastructure cloud market with many strong players, it seems we have a replica of networking hardware market, this time called <em>AWS and seven dwarfs</em>.</p>
<p>Want to know more about networking in Microsoft Azure? The <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=AzureNet">slide deck is ready</a> and available to ipSpace.net subscribers. I’ll <a href="https://www.sig-switzerland.ch/microsoft_azure_networking/">run a workshop using this material in Zurich (Switzerland) on June 12th</a>, and a webinar sometime in autumn 2019.</p>
