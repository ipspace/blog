<p>I hate listening to “this is what we were doing this year” podcasts as they usually turn into pointless blabbering, self-congratulations and meaningless plans (think New Year resolutions). <a href="https://packetpushers.net/podcast/full-stack-journey-028-turning-the-mic-on-scott-lowe/">The Full Stack Journey Episode 28</a> with Scott Lowe was an amazing deviation from this too-common template.</p>
<p>If you don’t have time to listen to the podcast (but you <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6919#page-4">OUGHT TO</a> do it) here’s what I loved most: “<em>When faced with the onslaught of new technologies, don’t panic. Wait a few months to see which ones survive</em>”.<!--more--></p>
<p>Maybe networking truly is different, but I wouldn’t wait a few months but a year or two. Remember when Cisco ACI was launched? It might be safe to use it now. Remember early Juniper videos promising the nirvana of EVPN/VXLAN and demonstrating how simple the configuration was a year before the code actually shipped… and a few years before it was ready for production use?</p>
<p>Whatever networking technology the vendors are pushing, wait at least a few months before you start gathering data, then a bit more before you start playing with it in the lab, and way longer before you deploy it in production… while carefully evaluating whether the technology <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/this-is-what-makes-networking-so-complex.html">solves a real business problem</a> that <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/01/long-distance-vmotion-stretched-ha.html">cannot be solved by changing the way you work</a>, fixing your design, eliminating the snowflakes or (god forbid) talking with the application team and figuring out common goals.</p>
<p>However, that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be considering interesting ideas that use age-old technologies in novel ways like (ta-da) network automation. There’s no good reason you should still hand-craft your configurations instead of using templates, or use arcane naming conventions to keep track of versions and changes instead of pushing everything into source code control repository like Git.</p>
<p>Likewise, it’s stupid to yammer about the lack of $vendor-supplied tools when you could easily build your own, and even worse to claim you cannot get data out of the network when all you need is a framework that can execute the same <strong>show</strong> command on all devices in your network, parse the printout to extract useful data (thank you, $vendors for not providing an API that would return structured data), and create a report.</p>
<p>Also, it might be worth exploring the world around you. For example, if you master enough HTML to create a web page you can immediately start creating PDF reports (there’s an open-source tool that generates PDF from HTML), and if you manage to master the somewhat-arcane DOT syntax it’s extremely easy to create graph descriptions that can be turned into images (or PDF) or into dynamic graphs displayed on web pages.</p>
<p>The only roadblock on this journey is your mindset. You have to decide whether you want to keep yammering, or whether you want to become tool-builder. The choice is yours, and there’s no need to panic - like most things in life, it’s not as hard as it looks when you’re starting (and we have a <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">great course to help you get to your destination</a>).</p>
