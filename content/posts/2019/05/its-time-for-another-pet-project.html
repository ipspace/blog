title: It's Time for Another Pet Project

<p>More than a decade ago I decided to start a pet project: a blog describing interesting details of networking technologies. The idea quickly morphed into vendor-neutral webinars - the first one took place in February 2010. A year or two later I had my first guest speaker and as of today we had <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Authors">more than 50 industry experts</a> participating in <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Webinars">ipSpace.net webinars</a> and <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Courses">online courses</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime the ipSpace.net team grew: I had video and audio editors for years, <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Team:Irena_Marcetic">Irena Marčetič</a> took over marketing, logistics, and production in 2018, and we got a team of webinar moderators that will help us with guest speaker webinars (last week we ran the first guest speaker webinar where I didn’t have to be involved - hooray ;)<!--more--></p>
<p>Hopefully this will give me a bit more time to get back to my pet project: explaining the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work">fundamentals of how networks really work</a>. We’ll start the journey on June 18th, and while you won’t be able to attend the live sessions without having a <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">paid ipSpace.net subscription</a> I’ll make most of the materials part of the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free">free subscription</a>.</p>
<p>However, here’s how you can earn your seat in the live sessions even if you don’t have an ipSpace.net subscription: send me a really cool question you’d like to see addressed in the webinar and if I decide to talk about it, you’ll be there to ask additional questions ;)</p>
