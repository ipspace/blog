Last week [I explained](/2019/05/data-deduplication-in-network.html) how you could take a [typical first attempt at a network automation data model](/kb/DataModels/) and [reduce the amount of duplicate data](/kb/DataModels/10-Removing%20Duplicate%20Data.html)... but the data model we used was still describing a set of seemingly disconnected boxes.

How about [restructuring the whole thing](/kb/DataModels/20-Restructure.html) and describing what networks really are - graphs made of nodes (network devices) and links?
