<p>I hope I'm still allowed to quote a paragraph from someone else's article (thank you, EU, you did a great job). Here's what Jeffrey Zeldman <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/nothing-fails-like-success/">wrote about startup business models</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">A family buys a house they can’t afford. They can’t make their monthly mortgage payments, so they borrow money from the Mob. Now they’re in debt to the bank and the Mob, live in fear of losing their home, and must do whatever their creditors tell them to do.</blockquote>
<p>Read the article and think about how it applies to unicorn-based networking technologies ;)</p>
