title: How Hard Is It to Manage Your Intent?

<p><em>This blog post was initially sent to subscribers of my SDN and Network Automation mailing list. </em><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscribe/Five_SDN_Tips"><em>Subscribe here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Remember the “<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/06/what-is-intent-based-networking.html"><em>every device configuration is really an expression of our intent</em></a>” discussion? Forgetting the wrong level of abstraction (we mostly don’t want to deal with all the idiosyncratic stuff network devices want to see in their configurations) and box-oriented thinking caused by device-level intent for the moment, let’s focus on another aspect: how hard is it to manage your intent?<!--more--></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>If you want to change your intent (in plain English: device configuration), how hard is it to get from current configuration to the new one?</li>
<li>How hard is it to see what intent has been passed to the system (in plain English: how is the device or system configured)?</li>
</ul>
<p>In you’re working with decent networking devices you’re probably wondering why I’m even bringing up these topics. After all, the answer to the first one is <em>replace configuration </em>and the answer to the second one is <em>show configuration</em>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, not all network devices support <em>configuration replace</em> functionality (for example, <strong>configure replace </strong>was added to Nexus OS in April 2018), and even if a network device supports non-disruptive replacement of its configuration, it might not allow you to replace parts of the configuration without an interesting carefully-choreographed dance of configuration commands. </p>
<p>Note: the only exception I know of is Junos that treats device configuration as a data model that can be manipulated in any way you wish and implemented when you’re satisfied with its state. Arista’s <strong>config sessions </strong>might work the same way.</p>
<p>Now imagine you’re evaluating an abstracted intent-based system with a beautiful GUI and a REST API. Don’t forget to ask these questions (and don’t back down until you get the answers):</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Can you easily <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2018/04/dont-get-obsessed-with-rest-api.html">replace your intent when you want to</a> or do you have to <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2018/05/layers-of-single-pane-of-glass.html">work through GUI (or API calls)</a> to massage the current state of the system into what you want it to be?</li>
<li>Can you see all of your intent in a single place or do you have to <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2018/06/automation-win-document-cisco-aci.html">navigate through GUI screens and take notes of what’s configured</a> (or execute a dozen of API calls to get it)?</li>
<li>Can you track a history of changes to your intent?</li>
<li>Can you track the changes to your intent with standard version-control tools like Git/GitLab/GitHub/… or do you have to use tools embedded into the system? Are there any such tools available in the system?</li>
<li>How easy is it to automate changes to your intent (like implementing the same fix to all tenants configured in the system)?</li>
<li>How easy is it to integrate the intent-based system into whatever application testing/deployment pipeline?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: You might have noticed that the above questions describe <em>infrastructure-as-code </em>concepts ;)</p>
