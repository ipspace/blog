<p>Every time a new simple programming language is invented, we go through the same predictable cycle:</p>
<ul><li>Tons of hype;</li>
<li>Unbounded enthusiasm when people who never worked in target environment realize they could get something simple done in a short time;</li>
<li>Ever-worsening headaches as the enthusiasts try to get a real job done with the shiny new tool;</li>
<li>Disappointment;</li>
<li>A more powerful language is invented to replace the old one.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few years ago we experienced the same cycle when OpenFlow was the-one-tool-to-bind-them all.<!--more--> Not surprisingly, P4 (a more powerful language) was quickly proposedâ€¦ ironically by the same people who were telling us how awesome OpenFlow was.</p>
<p>Is P4 just another heap of hype or is it useful? <a href="https://nsg.ee.ethz.ch/home/">Networked Systems Group</a> at ETH Zurich created some interesting applications with P4 and <a href="https://vanbever.eu/">Laurent Vanbever</a> (of the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/10/software-defined-ixp-with-laurent.html">software-defined IXP</a> and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/11/fibbing-ospf-based-traffic-engineering.html">Fibbing</a> fame) was kind enough to describe them in <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_102-Real-Life_P4.mp3">Episode 102</a> of <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a>.</p>
