<p>I’m not the only one telling people not to bet the farm on Santa Claus and dancing unicorns. Pete Welcher wrote a nice blog post <a href="https://www.netcraftsmen.com/the-cloud-is-not-magic/">describing the implications of laws of physics and data gravity</a> (I described the gory details in <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Designing_Active-Active_and_Disaster_Recovery_Data_Centers"><em>Designing Active-Active Data Centers</em></a> and <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Amazon_Web_Services_Networking"><em>AWS Networking Deep Dive</em></a> webinars).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russ White <a href="https://rule11.tech/the-network-sized-holes-in-serverless/">reviewed an article</a> that (without admitting it) <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03383.pdf">discovered that serverless is just software running on other people’s servers</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
