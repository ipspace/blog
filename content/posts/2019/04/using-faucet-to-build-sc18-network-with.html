title: Using Faucet to Build SC18 Network with OpenFlow

<p>Remember how Nick Buraglio tried to <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/12/running-open-daylight-in-production.html">use OpenDaylight to build a small part of SuperComputing conference network</a>… and ended up with a programmable patch panel?</p>
<p>This time he repeated the experiment using <a href="https://faucet.nz/">Faucet SDN Controller</a> – an OpenFlow controller focused on getting the job done – and <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_101-Faucet_at_SC18.mp3">described his experience in Episode 101</a> of <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a>.</p>
<p>We started with the usual “<em>what problem were you trying to solve” </em>and quickly started teasing apart the architecture and got geekily focused on interesting things like:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>How do you integrate Faucet with external autonomous systems?</li>
<li>How did they automate Faucet configuration generation from conference-wide database?</li>
<li>How stable is Faucet?</li>
<li>What hardware can you run Faucet on?</li>
<li>How could you do network monitoring with Faucet?</li>
<li>How do you implement highly-available cluster of Faucet controllers?</li>
<li>What are the limits of OpenFlow-based networks?</li>
<li>What switches can you use with Faucet and what are the minimum requirements to have a usable OpenFlow switch?</li>
</ul>
<p>And just in case you want to know more about Cisco’s and HPE’s programmable ASICs, we covered them in <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/04/programmable-asics-on-software-gone-wild.html">Episode 76</a> (Cisco) and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/06/software-defined-hardware-forwarding.html">Episode 37</a> (HPE).</p>
