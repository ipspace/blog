title: Why Is MPLS Segment Routing Better than LDP?

<p>A while ago I made a statement along the lines of “<em>MPLS s</em><em>egment routing is the best thing that happened to MPLS control plane in a decade”</em>. Obviously some MPLS-focused engineers disagree with that and a few years ago I decided to write a lengthy blog post explaining the differences between using MPLS SR with IGP (or BGP) versus more traditional <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/01/bgp-free-service-provider-core-in.html">IGP+LDP approach</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously, I wasn’t making any progress on that front, so the only way forward was to record a short video on the topic which didn’t work well either because the end-result was a set of three videos (available with <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free">free</a> or <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual">paid</a> ipSpace.net <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">subscription</a>).</p>
