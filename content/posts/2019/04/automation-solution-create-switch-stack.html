<p>Have you ever wondered how many free ports you have on your stackable campus switches? I’m sure there must be a wonderful network management tool that creates that reports with a click of a button… but what if the tool your PHB purchased based on awesome PowerPoint and glitzy demo can’t do that?</p>
<p>Nadeem Lughmani decided to solve this challenge as a <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutSol&amp;module=2#M2S4">hands-on assignment</a> in the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course and created an Ansible playbook and a Python plugin that <a href="https://github.com/nadeemnet/up_interfaces">counts the total number of ports and number of free ports for each switch stack specified in the device inventory</a>.</p>
<p>Wonder what else course attendees created in the past? <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/NetAutSol/Solutions">Here’s a small sample</a>.</p>
