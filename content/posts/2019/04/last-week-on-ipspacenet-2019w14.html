<p>Last Thursday I started another experiment: a series of live webinar sessions focused on <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/NetBiz">business aspects of networking technologies</a>. The first session expanded on the idea of <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/11/the-three-paths-of-enterprise-it.html">three paths of enterprise IT</a>. It covered the commoditization of IT and networking in particular, vendor landscape, various attempts at segmenting customers, and potential long-term Enterprise IT paths. <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetBiz">Recording is already online</a> and currently available with <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">standard subscription</a>.</p>
<p>Although the attendance was lower than usual, attendees thoroughly enjoyed it – one of them sent me this: “<em>the value of ipSpace.net is that you cut through the BS</em>”. Mission accomplished ;)</p>
