title: 'Commentary: We’re stuck with 40 years old technology'

<p>One of my readers sent me this email after reading my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/02/loop-avoidance-in-vxlan-networks.html">Loop Avoidance in VXLAN Networks</a> blog post:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Not much has changed really! It’s still a flood/learn bridged network, at least in parts. We count 2019 and talk a lot about “fabrics” but have 1980’s networks still.</blockquote>
<p>The networking fundamentals haven’t changed in the last 40 years. We still use IP (sometimes with larger addresses and augmentations that make it harder to use and more vulnerable), <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/08/what-went-wrong-tcpip-lacks-session.html">stream-based transport protocol</a> on top of that, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/08/what-went-wrong-socket-api.html">leak addresses up and down the protocol stack</a>, and rely on technology that was <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/02/lets-get-rid-of-thick-yellow-cable.html">designed to run on 500 meters of thick yellow cable</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>Even worse, we still believe (in most parts) we should do <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/04/what-is-layer-2-and-why-do-we-need-it.html">bridging within a subnet</a> and routing across subnets. Until we admit we were wrong and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/05/reinventing-clns-with-l3-only-forwarding.html">start doing routing on IP addresses</a> (see also: CLNP and OSI stack) we won’t be making any progress.</p>
<p>Broken **** misusing transparent bridging behavior obviously doesn’t help - the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/this-is-what-makes-networking-so-complex.html">real reason</a> we have to support the brokenness is <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/01/revisited-need-for-stretched-vlans.html">all the weird stuff that would stop working if we go from bridging to routing</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Sure, the classic bridging has <em>partially</em> been replaced with “fabrics” which hopefully are routed these days (heck, we had routed L2 with fabricpath or trill many years ago!). </blockquote>
<p>While <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/07/why-is-trill-not-routing-at-layer-2.html">TRILL and FabricPath were almost routing on layer-2</a> they could never get away from the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/07/bridging-and-routing-is-there.html">fundamentals of bridging</a>: lack of address summarization, data-plane based learning, and flooding - the three characteristics that make bridging inherently non-scalable.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">But with a few exceptions like your blog (thank you!) nobody, especially not the vendors, focus on the big problem: the edge, where things get a bit out of control. </blockquote>
<p>No wonder: dealing with real-life problems is not sexy, often doesn’t sell, and usually turns out to be a huge morass.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">As you mentioned, it is not particular hard to implement reactive fixes: run an active protocol to detect the loop; you mention STP but vendors should have defined a separate L2 probe, the job is important enough to have a separate protocol. Send a probe, detect a packet with a fabric-owned src-MAC on another fabric-edge port, shutdown the particular port(s). </blockquote>
<p>STP does the job just fine unless <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2016/03/reader-comments-spanning-tree-woes.html">someone actively messes it up</a>:</p>
<ul><li>Properly configured fabric edge ports would send BPDUs and shut down on receiving one (<ins>BPDU guard and-or</ins> root guard <ins>depending on whether you’re trying to detect a forwarding loop or an external switch</ins>)</li>
<li>If a node passing packets between two interfaces doesn’t recognize BPDUs, loop prevention works because BPDUs make it to the other end and trigger root guard.</li>
<li>If a node acts like 802.1 bridge, STP stops the loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, some people believe <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/08/stp-and-expert-beginners.html">it’s better to turn off STP</a> (because everyone tells them STP is a mess), and at least <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/09/dear-vmware-bpdu-filter-bpdu-guard.html">some vendors are more interested in pretending there’s no problem</a> than in fixing it by shutting down the offending node/port.</p>
<p>Could we “solve” the problem by adding another STP-like protocol (like VMware beacon frames)? I’m positive there are vendors out there doing something along these lines with proprietary protocols (would appreciate pointers in the comments).</p>
<p>However, I have a nasty feeling that trying to create a standard protocol to solve that challenge would quickly bring us into “turtles all the way down” scenario - who would define what MAC address should be used for that protocol, and what happens when you connect two fabrics together?</p>
<p>The only real solution I see is to:</p>
<ul><li>Admit that data-link layer connects adjacent nodes;</li>
<li>Stop pretending that we can use a technology that was designed to connect nodes to a shared cable when implementing multi-site networking;</li>
<li>Use <em>routing</em> regardless of whether it uses IP prefixes, IP addresses or even MAC addresses to build robust and stable networks.</li>
</ul>
