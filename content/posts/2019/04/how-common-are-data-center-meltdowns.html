<p>We all know about catastrophic headline-generating failures like AWS East-1 region falling apart or a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/01/large-layer-2-domains-strike-again.html">major provider being down for a day or two</a>. Then there are failures known only to those who care, like <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/06/another-spectacular-layer-2-failure.html">losing a major exchange point</a>. However, I’m becoming more and more certain that the known failures are not even the tip of the iceberg - they seem to be <a href="https://www.redbull.com/int-en/tv/video/AP-1P353TQQW1W11/climbing-icebergs-in-greenland">the climber at the iceberg summit</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>I’m occasionally running on-site design workshops and although I don’t keep track, my guess is that at least 25% of the companies I’m running workshops in experienced a more-or-less catastrophic bridging-caused meltdown in not-so-distant past. Sometimes it stays within a data center and impacts the performance of all hosts attached to the affected VLAN, sometimes they manage to bring down two data centers (hooray for Stretched VLANs).</p>
<p>It might be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias">selection bias</a>. Customers engaging me usually run complex environments that might be by definition prone to weird failures. On the other hand, at least some of them run well-managed environments, and they got a bridging loop even though they did all the right things.</p>
<p>It might be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>. I keep telling people how dangerous large L2 environments are, so I might remember those workshops where they told me “yeah, that happened recently” better than others.</p>
<p>Or it could be that the vendors are truly peddling broken technology (of course only because the customers ask for it, right?) and we’re paying the price of CIOs or high-level architects making decisions based on glitzy PowerPoints and “impartial” advice from $vendor consultants.</p>
<p>I simply don’t have enough data points to know better, and it seems <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2016/10/the-network-is-reliable-and-other.html">we made no real progress in the last few years</a> - all I could find was anecdata. Your feedback would be highly appreciated.</p>
