<p>People who can explain complex topics in simple terms, or focus on the essentials of a particular topic are exceedingly rare… and two of the best are <a href="https://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/">Randall Munroe of the XKCD fame</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk">Julia Evans</a>, the mastermind behind <a href="https://wizardzines.com/">WizardZines</a>. I loved her recent <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/08/27/curl-exercises/">curl</a> and <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/08/30/git-exercises--navigate-a-repository/">git</a> exercises, and I’m guessing a lot of people in this industry would benefit from her latest <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/09/12/new-zine-on-http/">HTTP</a> zine.</p>
<p>Similarly to what I did a long time ago with ipSpace.net, Julia recently <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/09/13/a-year-explaining-computer-things/">decided to go all-in</a>, leaving her job and focusing on explaining things. I hope it will work out and we’ll keep enjoying her tidbits of wisdom for years to come.</p>
