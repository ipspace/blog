title: 'Just Published: NSX-T Technical Deep Dive Slide Deck'

<p>Last year when I was creating the first version of <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/VMware_NSX_Technical_Deep_Dive">VMware NSX Deep Dive content</a>, NSX-V was mainstream and NSX-T was the new kid on the block. A year later <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/08/brief-history-of-vmware-nsx.html">NSX-V is mostly sidelined, and all the development efforts are going into NSX-T</a>. Time to adapt the webinar to new reality… taking the usual staged approach:</p>
<ul><li>The <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NSX#SLIDES">new slide deck covering NSX-V and NSX-T</a> is ready. It includes early information about NSX-T release 2.5; I’ll fill in the details once the documentation becomes public.</li>
<li>I’ll use the slide deck in <a href="https://www.sig-switzerland.ch/vmware-nsx-architecture-deep-dive/">day-long workshop in Zurich on September 10th</a>.</li>
<li>The live webinar sessions (including updated NSX-T 2.5 content) will start on November 14th.</li>
</ul>
