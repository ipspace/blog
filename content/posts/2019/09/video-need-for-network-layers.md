After identifying some of the challenges every network solution must address ([part 1](https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/08/video-networking-challenges.html), [part 2](https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/08/video-introducing-transmission.html), [part 3](https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/09/video-beyond-two-nodes.html)) we tried to tackle an interesting question: "*how do you implement this whole spaghetti mess in a somewhat-reliable and structured way?*"

The Roman Empire had an answer more than 2000 years ago: divide-and-conquer (aka "*eating the elephant one bite at a time*"). These days, we call it *layering* and *abstractions*.

In the [Need for Network Layers](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/L2.1%20-%20The%20Need%20for%20Network%20Layers.mp4?doccode=Net101) video, I listed all the challenges we have to address and then described how you could group them in meaningful modules (called *networking layers*).
