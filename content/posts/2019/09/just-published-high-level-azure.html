<p>Last week we started the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Microsoft_Azure_Networking">Microsoft Azure Networking</a> saga that will eventually mirror the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Amazon_Web_Services_Networking">AWS Networking</a> materials.</p>
<p>I <a href="/2019/08/recently-published-azure-networking.html">recorded the hands-on demos in advance</a> so we had plenty of time to discuss Azure API and CLI, geographies, regions and availability zones, high-availability concepts, and deployments modelsâ€¦ and spent the second half of the live session focusing on virtual networks, subnets, interface, and IP addresses. The <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=AzureNet">videos are already online</a> and accessible with <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual">Standard ipSpace.net Subscription</a>.</p>
<p>Next step (on September 24th): network security and user-defined routes.</p>
