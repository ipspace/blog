---

<p>Last week we started the Autumn 2019 <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course with an interesting presentation from <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Matthias_Luft">Matthias Luft</a> focused on open-source supply chain security</p>
<p><strong>TL&amp;DR</strong>: Can I download whatever stuff I found as my first Google hit and use it in my automation solution? ****, NO!</p>
<p>Matthias covered these topics:<!--more--></p>
<ul><li>Discovering dependencies in large open-source projects;</li>
<li>The basics of supply chain security and trust;</li>
<li>Technical mechanisms one can use to increase trust, and heuristics of trust;</li>
<li>An overview of well-known software supply chain security incidents (including YAML/JSON parsing vulnerability in Ansible)</li>
<li>Fundamental challenges we’re facing in brave new open-source world (from unknown authors to unknown security posture of source code)</li>
<li>Potential mitigations, including a pragmatic approach of establishing an in-house software inventory and monitoring vulnerability feeds)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone ever attending the automation course can already <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutSol&amp;module=1#M1S6A">access the materials</a> (we believe in <em>lifetime access</em>)… and if you never attended the course you can get them with <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual">Expert ipSpace.net Subscription</a>.</p>
