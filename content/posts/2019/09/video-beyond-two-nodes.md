In the introductory videos of [How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work) webinar I described the [mandatory elements of any networking solution](https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/08/video-networking-challenges.html) and [additional challenges you have to solve when you can't pull a cable between the adjacent nodes](https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/08/video-introducing-transmission.html).

It's time for the next bit of complexity: what if we have [more than two nodes connected to the same network segment](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/L1.3%20-%20Beyond%20Two%20Nodes.mp4?doccode=Net101)? Welcome to the world of multi-access networks and data link control.
