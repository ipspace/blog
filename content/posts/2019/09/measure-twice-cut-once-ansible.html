<p>As I was preparing the materials for <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible 2.7 Update</a> webinar sessions I wanted to dive deeper into declarative configuration modules, starting with “<em>I wonder what’s going on behind the scenes</em>”</p>
<p>No problem: configure EEM applet command logging on Cisco IOS and execute an <strong>ios_interface</strong> module (more about that in another blog post)</p>
<p>Next step: let’s see how multi-platform modules work. Ansible has <strong>net_interface</strong> module that’s supposed to be used to configure interfaces on many different platforms significantly simplifying Ansible playbooks.<!--more--></p>
<div class="info" data-markdown="1">I hate Ansible’s “<em>let’s develop almost-identical but differently-named modules for every platform</em>” approach to network automation and use NAPALM wherever possible. </div>
<p>Starting with the <a href="https://github.com/ipspace/NetOpsWorkshop/blob/master/Ansible/Networking/Declarative-Configuration/ios-loopback.yml"><strong>ios_interface</strong> sample playbook</a>, I <a href="https://github.com/ipspace/NetOpsWorkshop/blob/master/Ansible/Networking/Declarative-Configuration/net-loopback.yml">changed <strong>ios_interface</strong> call into <strong>net_interface</strong></a>, ran the playbook on IOS and NX-OS devices, and failed miserably:</p>

<p>What could possibly go wrong? Here’s a slide from my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible for Networking Engineers</a> webinar explaining how platform-independent modules really work:</p>
<div class="separator"><a href="/2019/09/s1600-Ansible_Net_Interface_Details.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="/2019/09/s600-Ansible_Net_Interface_Details.png" style="border: 1px #E0E0E0 solid"/></a></div>
<p>Got it? The <strong>net_interface</strong> module is just a thin layer of veneer using platform-specific <strong>something_interface</strong> modules (selected based on <strong>ansible_network_os</strong> variable) to do the real work.</p>
<p>Still doesn’t explain the failure, does it? Let’s check the parameters of <strong>ios_interface</strong> and <strong>nxos_interface</strong> (the modules implementing <strong>net_interface</strong> behind the scenes):</p>
<ul><li><strong>ios_interface</strong> (and <strong>eos_interface</strong>) has a single parameter (<strong>state</strong>) specifying interface state. It can take four values: <em>present, absent, up</em> and <em>down</em>.</li>
<li><strong>nxos_interface</strong> has two parameters: <strong>state</strong> which accepts values <em>present</em> and <em>absent</em>, and <strong>admin_state</strong> which can be <em>up</em> or <em>down</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can probably see the problem by now: there’s absolutely no way you could bring an IOS and a NX-OS interface in UP state using the same set of parameters.</p>
<p>Old woodworkers had a saying that might be applicable to many software projects not just Ansible: “<em>measure twice, cut once.</em>” In this particular case it seems we’re in the “<em>I cut it three times and it’s still too short</em>” territory :(</p>
