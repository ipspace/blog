<p>In <a href="/kb/Internet/PMTUD/">Never-Ending Story of IP Fragmentation</a> I described how you could use TCP Maximum Segment Size to minimize the impact of IP fragmentation and PMTUD blackholes (<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/01/tcp-mss-clamping-what-is-it-and-why-do.html">more details on TCP MSS clamping</a>)â€¦ but one has to wonder how people use TCP MSS in the wild and what values you might see.</p>
<p>As is often the case, Geoff Houston found a way to measure them, and published the answer: <a href="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2019-07/mss.html">TCP MSS Values</a></p>
