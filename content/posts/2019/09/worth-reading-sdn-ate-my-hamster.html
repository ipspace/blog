<p>A long while ago Daniel Dib <a href="http://lostintransit.se/2019/02/04/sdn-ate-my-hamster/">wrote a nice blog post</a> on “<a href="/2016/07/why-is-every-sdn-vendor-bashing.html">SDN will make the networking engineers obsolete</a>” theme. While it sounds like beating a dead horse, the SDN craze isn’t subsiding, so another healthy dose of common sense might come handy.</p>
<p><strong>Hint</strong>: if you’re not following Daniel’s blog, you should… even though he decided to make old farts’ life harder by publishing on LinkedIn.</p>
