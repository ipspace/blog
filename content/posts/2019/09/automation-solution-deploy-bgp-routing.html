<p>A while ago Ruben Tripiana tried to <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/01/use-yang-data-models-to-configure.html">configure BGP on Cisco IOS using IETF YANG data models</a>â€¦ and failed. In Spring 2019 <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions online course</a> Chris Crook decided to deploy BGP routing on multiple platforms using YANG data models instead of configuration templates. Not only did he succeed, he also <a href="https://github.com/ctopher78/network-automation-course/blob/master/Homework3/README.md">documented his work</a> and the tools he used, and <a href="https://github.com/ctopher78/network-automation-course/tree/master/Homework3">published the solution</a> so you can replicate his efforts.</p>
<p>You can find many more network automation solutions created by the attendees of our automation course in <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/NetAutSol/Solutions">solutions showcase</a>.</p>
