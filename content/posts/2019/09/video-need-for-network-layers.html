<p>After identifying some of the challenges every network solution must address (<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/08/video-networking-challenges.html">part 1</a>, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/08/video-introducing-transmission.html">part 2</a>, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/09/video-beyond-two-nodes.html">part 3</a>) we tried to tackle an interesting question: “<em>how do you implement this whole spaghetti mess in a somewhat-reliable and structured way?</em>”</p>
<p>The Roman Empire had an answer more than 2000 years ago: divide-and-conquer (aka “<em>eating the elephant one bite at a time</em>”). These days we call it <em>layering</em> and <em>abstractions</em>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/L2.1%20-%20The%20Need%20for%20Network%20Layers.mp4?doccode=Net101">Need for Network Layers</a> video I listed all the challenges we have to address, and then described how you could group them in meaningful modules (called <em>networking layers</em>).</p>
