<p>I always love to hear from networking engineers who managed to start their network automation journey. Hereâ€™s what one of them wrote after watching <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible for Networking Engineers webinar</a> (part of <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">paid ipSpace.net subscription</a>, also available as an <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Courses">online course</a>).</p>
<blockquote class="cite">This webinar helped me a lot in understanding Ansible and the benefits we can gain. It is a big area to grasp for a non-coder and this webinar was exactly what I needed to get started (in a lab), including a lot of tips and tricks and how to think. It was more fun than I expected so started with Python just to get a better grasp of programing and Jinja.</blockquote>
<p>In early 2019 we made the webinar even better with a series of live sessions covering new features added to recent Ansible releases, from core features (loops) to networking plugins and new declarative intent modules.</p>
