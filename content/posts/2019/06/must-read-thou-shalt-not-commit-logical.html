<p>Found a <a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/">fantastic list of common logical fallacies</a>. It's a must read for anyone having at least occasional interaction with non-Vulcans... and when you stop laughing (or screaming, or both) make sure you go through the <a href="https://yourbias.is/">companion web site</a> to understand bugs in your wetware that sabotage your attempts at being perfectly logical.</p>
