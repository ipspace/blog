title: Use Per-Link Prefixes in Network Data Models

<p>We got pretty far in our <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/05/data-deduplication-in-network.html">data deduplication in network data model</a> journey, from <a href="/kb/DataModels/">initial attempts</a> to <a href="/kb/DataModels/30-Generalize%20Network%20Model.html">network modeled as a graph</a>… but we still haven’t got rid of all the duplicate information.</p>
<p>For example, if we have multiple devices connected to the same subnet, why should we have to specify IP address and subnet mask for every device (literally begging the operators to make input errors). Wouldn’t it be better (assuming we don’t care about exact IP addresses on core links) to assign IP addresses automatically?</p>
