<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielfjteycheney/">Daniel Teycheney</a> attended the Spring 2019 <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course and sent me this feedback after completing it (and creating some <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/NetAutSol/Solutions">interesting real-life solutions</a> on the way):</p>
<hr/><p>I spent a bit of time the other day reflecting on how much I’ve learn’t from the course in terms of technical skills and the amount I’ve learned has been great. I literally no idea about things like Git, Jinja2, CI testing, reading YAML files and had only briefly seen Ansible before.</p>
<p>I’m not an expert now, but I understand these things and have real practical experience on these subjects which has given me great confidence to push on and keep getting better.<!--more--></p>
<p>There is so much content, of such high quality available from the course and I plan to keep coming back and touch up on areas when need be.</p>
<p>The quality of speakers that were available on the course was staggering. They were operating on a different level to myself, but I hold aspirations for getting there one day. Some of the presentations completely blew my mind and you don’t get these experiences without enrolling in this course.</p>
<p>Finally, I really enjoyed getting personal feedback from yourself on my assignments and things that I could improve. Getting access to you with all your experience reviewing the assignments was a real help and a real feature of my experience.</p>
<p>Thanks again for providing this course and I will be recommending it to others who are interested in network automation.</p>
<hr/><p>Sounds interesting? Hurry up - there are only a <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions#register">few early bird tickets left</a>.</p>
