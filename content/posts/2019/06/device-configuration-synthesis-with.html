<p>When I was still at university the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-generation_programming_language">fourth-generation programming languages</a> were all the hype, prompting us to make jokes along the lines “fifth generation will implement <em>do what I don’t know how</em>”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://nsg.ee.ethz.ch/home/">research team working in Networked Systems Group</a> at ETH Zurich headed by prof. <a href="https://www.vanbever.eu/">Laurent Vanbever</a> got pretty close. The <a href="https://netcomplete.ethz.ch/">description of their tool</a> says:<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite"><p>NetComplete automatically autocompletes configurations for routers running multiple interacting protocols, including policy-based protocols (BGP) and shortest-path protocols (OSPF), and it also supports static routes. NetComplete takes as input configurations with “holes” that identify the parameters to be completed and “autocompletes” these with concrete values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like magic? Laurent shared some of the implementation details in <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_103-NetComplete.mp3">Episode 103</a> of <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild/">Software Gone Wild</a>, and you’ll find even more information on <a href="https://netcomplete.ethz.ch/">their web site</a>. Want to figure out how it all works? <a href="https://github.com/nsg-ethz/synet-plus">Download the tool</a> and start exploring.</p>
