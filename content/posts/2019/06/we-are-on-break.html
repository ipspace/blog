<p>It’s high time for another summer break (I get closer and closer to burnout every year - either I’m working too hard or I’m getting older ;).</p>
<p>Of course we’ll do our best to reply to support (and sales ;) requests, but it might take us a bit longer than usual. I will publish an occasional <em>worth reading</em> or <em>watch out</em> blog post, but don’t expect anything deeply technical for the new two months.</p>
<p>We’ll be back (hopefully refreshed and with tons of new content) in early September, starting with <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">network automation course</a> on September 3rd and <a href="https://www.sig-switzerland.ch/vmware-nsx-architecture-deep-dive/">VMware NSX workshop</a> on September 10th.</p>
<p>In the meantime, try to get away from work (hint: automating stuff sometimes helps ;), turn off the Internet, and enjoy a few days in your favorite spot with your loved ones!</p>
