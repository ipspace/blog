title: Device Configuration Synthesis with NetComplete on Software Gone Wild

When I was still at university the [fourth-generation programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-generation_programming_language) were all the hype, prompting us to make jokes along the lines "fifth generation will implement *do what I don't know how*"

The [research team working in Networked Systems Group](https://nsg.ee.ethz.ch/home/) at ETH Zurich headed by prof. [Laurent Vanbever](https://www.vanbever.eu/) got pretty close. The [description of their tool](https://netcomplete.ethz.ch/) says:
<!--more-->
> NetComplete automatically autocompletes configurations for routers running multiple interacting protocols, including policy-based protocols (BGP) and shortest-path protocols (OSPF), and it also supports static routes. NetComplete takes as input configurations with "holes" that identify the parameters to be completed and "autocompletes" these with concrete values.

Sounds like magic? Laurent shared some of the implementation details in [Episode 103](http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_103-NetComplete.mp3) of [Software Gone Wild](https://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild/), and you'll find even more information on [their web site](https://netcomplete.ethz.ch/). Want to figure out how it all works? [Download the tool](https://github.com/nsg-ethz/synet-plus) and start exploring.
