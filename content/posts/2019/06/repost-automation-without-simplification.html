<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>The <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/11/no-scripting-required-to-start-your.html"><em>No Scripting Required to Start Your Automation Journey</em></a><em> </em>blog post generated lively discussions (and a bit of trolling from the anonymous peanut gallery). One of the threads focused on “<em>how does automation work in real life IT dep</em><em>artment</em><em> where it might be challenging to simplify operations before automating them due to many exceptions, legacy support…</em>”</p>
<p>Here’s a great answer provided by another reader:<!--more--></p>
<hr/><p>One small step at a time. :-)</p>
<p>First, if you have 100 switches, do you really have 100 different brands and models, or do you perhaps just have five brands and ten models?</p>
<p>Start then with the brand/model that you think will be the most common/important for you going forward. Identify fragments of commonality. E.g, all switches should do syslogging to $LOGSERVER, fetch time using SNTP from $NTPSERVER, and have SNMP set up to allow read using community "public", and no write access over SNMP.</p>
<p>Then write automation modules to make sure those things are what they are supposed to be. Even just having scripts to <strong>check</strong> that things are correct (and just complain if they are not) can be a big help.</p>
<p>You also need to nudge, cajole, bully and/or force commonality going forward. This is a multi-year project... Make sure that your users and management knows the costs of being unique.</p>
<p>Identify unnecessary differences. Do you have the same linecards in the same slots in your core routers/switches, or is a certain card in slot 1 in one router and in slot 3 in the other? Is distribution switch X connected to port 17 in one core router and port 23 in the other? Do you have the same VLANs/VRFs on all the uplinks from switch Y?</p>
