<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>TL&amp;DR: We ran two workshops in Zurich last week – a quick peek into <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Network_and_Security_Automation_with_Ansible">using Ansible for network automation</a> and updated <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Designing_Infrastructure_for_Private_Clouds">Building Private Cloud Infrastructure</a>. You can access workshop materials with any <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">paid ipSpace.net subscription</a>.</p>
<p>Now for the fun part…<!--more--></p>
<p>As always, the workshops were a boutique event. We usually get around a dozen attendees, resulting in a cozy atmosphere where we could discuss real-life challenges and solve at least a few pressing problems. As always, the attendees were keen on squeezing the most out of the day and asked tons of really interesting questions – expect to see a series of blog posts based on the discussions we had over lunch and the evening beer.</p>
<p>Couldn’t make it? No worries – the next one (focusing on Azure networking) will be in June, and we’ll run at least two more in early September and late November. The <em>save-the-date </em>emails will go out pretty soon, and who knows, maybe the stars will align and you’ll be able to combine a vacation in Europe with a workshop in Switzerland like an attendee from New Zealand managed to do.</p>
