<p>Spring started for real, so it was time for some early-spring cleaning and I managed to complete two webinars during last week:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>We covered the gory details of LISP and layer-2 <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Interconnects">data center interconnects</a> on Tuesday;</li>
<li>The third <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible for Networking Engineers</a> update session on Thursday covered <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Ansible#NET_CFG">network device configuration management</a> (merge, fetch, compare, replace, rollback and save) and declarative configuration modules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both webinars are part of standard <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">ipSpace.net subscription</a></p>
