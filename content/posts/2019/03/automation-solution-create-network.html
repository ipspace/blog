<p>Chris Crook decided to work on a pretty typical problem for his second hands-on assignment in the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course: create a network diagram from adjacency data.</p>
<p>He decided to rely on BGP adjacencies (I would usually use LLDP) and added an interesting twist: instead of Ansible he used <a href="https://github.com/nornir-automation/nornir">Nornir</a> with NAPALM.<!--more--></p>
<p>We would usually generate network diagrams with Graphviz, but Chris found a <a href="http://viz-js.com/">JavaScript library</a> that takes graph description in DOT format and displays it dynamically in a web page. Pure awesomeness ;)</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/ctopher78/network-automation-course/tree/master/Homework2">view his solution on GitHub</a> (I like how clean his <a href="https://github.com/ctopher78/network-automation-course/blob/master/Homework2/render_bgp_topology.py">Python code</a> looks) and learn more about Nornir straight from its author: <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions#DB18">David Barroso</a> did a <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutSol&amp;module=9#NORNIR">deep dive into Nornir</a> during the Autumn 2018 automation course (content accessible to course attendees and users with <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual">Expert Subscription</a>).</p>
