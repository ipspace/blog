<p>Wherever you look you find three kinds of people: those that build tools they need, those that find the tools they need, and those that yammer about the lack of tools without ever doing anything to solve the problem.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielfjteycheney/">Daniel Teycheney</a> is clearly in the first category. When faced with “<em>collect some data and create a simple report</em>” hands-on assignment during the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> course he started <a href="https://github.com/writememe/BlgNetAutoSol/tree/master/2_Easy_Wins">creating a toolbox of playbooks that can be used in initial network auditing</a>. I’m positive you’ll find tons of useful tidbits in his code ;)</p>
