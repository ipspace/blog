<p>A few weeks ago, I had an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmnRf0HCy_Q">interesting video chat with David Bombal</a> in which we covered a wide variety of topics including</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>What would you do if you started networking today?</li>
<li>How do you increase the value of your knowledge?</li>
<li>Networking hasnâ€™t changed in the last 40 years and whatever you learn about networking will still be valid 20 years from now;</li>
<li>Why should I learn and implement network automation?</li>
<li>When should I start learning about network automation?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: David posted the whole list of topics with timestamps in the pinned comment under the video.</p>
