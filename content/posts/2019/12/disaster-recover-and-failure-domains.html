<p>One of the responses to my <em><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/09/disaster-recovery-test-faking-another.html">Disaster Recovery Faking</a></em> blog post focused on failure domains:</p>
<blockquote class="cite"><p>What is the difference between supporting L2 stretched between two pods in your DC (which everyone does for seamless vMotion), and having a 30ms link between these two pods because they happen to be in different buildings?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope you agree that a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/05/layer-2-network-is-single-failure.html">single broadcast domain is a single failure domain</a>. If not, let agree to disagree and move on - my life is too short to argue about obvious stuff.<!--more--></p>
<p>Having a VLAN stretched across multiple pods destroys the idea of having pods in the first place (unless you need them for physical structure and/or scaling reasons) - you merged two potential availability zones into one.</p>
<p>Doing the same across multiple data centers has the same effect: you <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/01/long-distance-vmotion-stretched-ha.html">destroyed all the benefits of large investments you made when building a second site</a>, unless you use the second site solely as a cold/warm backup for the primary site. I don’t know many organizations where CIO or bean counters would agree to that approach.</p>
<p>There’s also a minor technical detail: WAN links fail more often than data center infrastructure (see also: <a href="https://twitter.com/lightingguy32/status/1131189271828860928">fiber finder in its natural habitat</a>). Stretching a VLAN across two data centers to build an active-active architecture <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/11/stretched-vlans-and-failing-firewall.html">introduces a weak link and effectively reduces the availability of that architecture</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you can’t (easily) do the same mistake if you use a public cloud as your backup site - most public cloud providers are sane enough to work exclusively on layer-3 and offer direct L3 (routed) links or IPsec-based VPN connectivity as the only means of building hybrid clouds (even when the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/11/stretched-layer-2-subnets-in-azure.html">whole thing looks like stretched VLANs to untrained eyes</a>). Not at least surprisingly, some enterprise networking- or virtualization vendors offer all sorts of crazy schemes on top of IP transport to stretch the VLANs to places they don’t belong to.</p>
