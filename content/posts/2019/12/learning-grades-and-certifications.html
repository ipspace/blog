<p>Cleaning my Inbox I found links to two interesting blog post: <a href="http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html">The Lesson to Unlearn</a> and <a href="https://daedtech.com/coders-in-the-hands-of-a-missing-god-how-newly-minted-freelancers-badly-miss-the-point/">Coders in the Hand of a Missing God</a>.</p>
<p>You might also want to read my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/tag/certifications.html">old certification ramblings</a>, or watch the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work">How Networks Really Work</a> webinar in case you care more about knowledge than certifications.</p>
