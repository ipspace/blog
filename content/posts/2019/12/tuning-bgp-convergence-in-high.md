Two weeks ago [Nicola Modena](https://www.ipspace.net/Expert:Nicola_Modena) explained how to [design BGP routing](/kb/BGPHighAvailability/10-BGP-Design/) to implement [resilient high-availability network services architecture](/kb/BGPHighAvailability/). The next step to tackle was obvious: [how do you fine-tune convergence times](/kb/BGPHighAvailability/30-Controlling-BGP-Convergence/), and how does BGP convergence compare to the more traditional FHRP-based design.
