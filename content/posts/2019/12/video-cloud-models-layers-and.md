In late spring 2019, [Matthias Luft](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Matthias_Luft) and [Florian Barth](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Florian_Barth) presented a short [webinar on cloud concepts](https://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Cloud_Computing), starting with the obvious topic: [cloud models, layers, and responsibilities](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Cloud101/1%20-%20Cloud%20Models,%20Layers%20and%20Responsibilities.mp4?doccode=Cloud101).
