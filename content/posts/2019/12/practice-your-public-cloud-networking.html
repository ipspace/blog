title: Practice Your Public Cloud Networking with Hands-On Exercises
url: /2019/12/practice-your-public-cloud-networking/
---

<p>Design assignments and hands-on exercises were always a big part of ipSpace.net online courses, and our new <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/PubCloud/">Networking in Public Cloud Deployments</a> course is no different.</p>
<p>You’ll start with a simple scenario: deploy a virtual machine running a web server. Don’t worry about your Linux skills, you’ll get the necessary (CCIE-level) instructions and the source code for the web server. Building on that, you’ll create another subnet and deploy another virtual machine acting as a back-end application server.</p>
<p>And then we’ll get to the fun part:<!--more--></p>
<ul><li>Automate the deployment, so you’ll be able to create the whole environment with a single script;</li>
<li>Add security groups to protect the servers;</li>
<li>Add a pointer to the web server instance to a public DNS zone;</li>
<li>Combine your public cloud deployment with a third-party CDN provider (I’d recommend using CloudFlare as I already have the code to execute the necessary API calls);</li>
<li>Change the routing table for the “inside” subnet to prevent the second server from getting into the wider Internet;</li>
<li>Create a second virtual network and peer it with the first one;</li>
<li>Deploy second web server instance and add Internet-facing load balancer;</li>
<li>Deploy second application server instance and add internal load balancer.</li>
<li>Deploy a web server in another region and add DNS-based load balancing.</li>
</ul>
