<p>Remember my rant about the <a href="/2019/06/how-microsoft-azure-orchestration.html">glacial speed of Azure orchestration system</a>? I decided I won’t allow it to derail yet another event and recorded the demos in advance of the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Microsoft_Azure_Networking">first live session</a>. The <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=AzureNet#DEMO">final videos are just over an hour long</a>; it probably took me at least three hours to record them.</p>
<p>If you plan to attend the live webinar session on September 12th, you might want to watch at least the first few videos before the live session - I will not waste everyone’s time repeating the demos during the live session.</p>
