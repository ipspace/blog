<p>One of my readers sent me a <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&amp;m=156327304011631&amp;w=2">link to an interesting L2-over-IP "design"</a>. Someone tried to connect two data centers with redundant <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/etherip.4">etherip</a> links using home-brewed redundancy mechanism and (surprise, surprise) managed to bring both of them down. The obvious fix: patch the etherip device driver.</p>
<div class="info">EtherIP is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3378">pre-VXLAN Ethernet-over-IP technology</a> yet again proving RFC1925 Rule 11.</div>
<p>I don't know enough about OpenBSD to figure out whether (A) it doesn't have STP at all, (B) STP doesn't work over EtherIP, (C) <a href="/2015/08/layer-3-only-data-center-networks-with/">host routing based on ARP entries</a> would be too much of a hassle, (D) some people don't understand the networking fundamentals, (E) everything looks like a nail once you found a hammer, or (F) all of the above. Insightful comments would be highly appreciated.</p>
