<p>Whenever you’re discussing a complex topic it’s worth adhering to two principles: (A) identify the challenges you’re trying to solve and (B) start as simple as you can and add complexity later.</p>
<p>We did exactly that in the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/L1.1%20-%20Introducing%20Networking%20Challenges.mp4?doccode=Net101">Introducing Networking Challenges</a> part of <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work">How Networks Really Work</a> webinar. We started with the simplest possible case of two computers connected with a cable… and even there identified a plethora of challenges that had to be solved more than half a century ago (and still have to be solved today no matter what magic software-defined technology someone pulls out of their wizard hat).</p>
