<p>Stumbled upon an <a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/2019/06/20/redundancy">excellent redundancy-focused blog post</a> (HT: <a href="http://highscalability.com/">High Scalability</a>). Here are just a few important points:</p>
<ul><li>Don’t make things too complex;</li>
<li>Don’t add more risk than you take away;</li>
<li>You’ve got to fail over in the right direction;</li>
<li>You must be able to return to fully-redundant mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m guessing that people promoting stretched VLANs, vSphere and/or NSX clusters running across multiple sites, weird combination of EVPN and OTV, and a dozen <a href="/2015/11/stretched-firewalls-across-layer-3-dci.html">similar shenanigans</a> never considered any one of these points.</p>
