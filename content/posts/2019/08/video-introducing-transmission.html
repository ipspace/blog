<p>After <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/08/video-networking-challenges.html">discussing the challenges one encounters even in the simplest networking scenario</a> connecting two computers with a cable we took a short diversion into an interesting complication: what if the two computers are far apart and we can’t pull a cable between them?</p>

It’s a topic one can spent a whole life exploring and mastering, so we were not able to do more than <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/L1.2%20-%20Introducing%20Transmission%20Technologies.mp4?doccode=Net101">cover the fundamentals of modulations and multiplexing technologies</a>.</p>
