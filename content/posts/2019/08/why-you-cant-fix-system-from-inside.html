<p>Stumbled upon an interesting article describing <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">numerous examples of how it's impossible to fix a system from the inside</a> because the good guys always lose to the more aggressive (and less scrupulous) individuals.</p>
<p>It's amazing how well the same ideas apply to TCP-versus-UDP, <a href="/2010/07/p2p-traffic-is-bad-for-network.html">P2P traffic versus everything else</a> (this one has been fixed after a lot of pressure from the outside), <a href="/2017/01/to-drop-or-to-delay-thats-question-on.html">latency- versus drop-based TCP congestion management</a> and <a href="/2014/05/marketing-grammar.html">$vendor marketing</a>.</p>
