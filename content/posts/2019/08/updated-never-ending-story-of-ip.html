<p>In mid 2000s I wrote a number of articles describing various TCP/IP features. Most of them are a bit outdated, so I decided to clean up, update and repost the most interesting ones on ipSpace.net, starting with <a href="/kb/Internet/PMTUD/">Never-Ending Story of IP Fragmentation</a>.</p>
<p>The first part of that article is already online, covering <a href="/kb/Internet/PMTUD/">MTU basics</a> and <a href="/kb/Internet/PMTUD/10-fragmentation-drawbacks/">drawbacks of IP fragmentation</a>.</p>
