Whenever discussing a complex topic, it's worth adhering to two principles: (A) identify the challenges you're trying to solve, and (B) start as simple as you can and add complexity later.

We started with the simplest possible case of two computers connected with a cable... and even there identified a plethora of challenges that had to be solved more than half a century ago (and still have to be solved today no matter what magic software-defined technology someone pulls out of their wizard hat).
