<p>When I was writing the <a href="/2018/11/worth-reading-back-to-basics.html">Back to Basics</a> blog post I reread the <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">Law of Leaky Abstractions</a> masterpiece. You’ll love it – the first example Joel uses is TCP.</p>
<p>However, what really caught my eye was this bit:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">The law of leaky abstractions means that whenever somebody comes up with a wizzy new code-generation tool that is supposed to make us all ever-so-efficient, you hear a lot of people saying “learn how to do it manually first, then use the wizzy tool to save time.”</blockquote>
<p>You should <a href="/2018/02/how-self-sufficient-do-you-want-to-be.html">apply the same wisdom</a> to shiny new gizmos launched by network virtualization vendors… oh wait, you can’t, they are <a href="/2015/11/can-you-afford-to-reformat-your-data.html">mostly undocumented black boxes</a>. Good luck ;)</p>
<p>Sadly, the Law of Leaky Abstractions blog post was written in 2002… and nothing changed in the meantime, at least not for the better.</p>
