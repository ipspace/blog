<p>You might have noticed that our <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Webinars/Sessions">Winter 2019 webinar schedule got crazily busy</a> with seven live sessions in the first two months of the year (another first)… but that’s not all, there are two more live sessions that we haven’t announced yet as we always schedule a single live session of a particular webinar.</p>
<p>Wondering what’s coming during the rest of 2019? Starting with committed ideas:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Following AWS Networking webinar, we’ll do a similar one on Azure (in early autumn 2019) and GCP (late 2019 or early 2020);</li>
<li>The materials for Docker 101 refresh has been ready for quite a while (subscribers can already <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DockerWS">download the slide deck</a>), but we simply couldn’t cram it into 2018 schedule. It’s currently scheduled for late spring.</li>
<li>Matthias Luft will run a series of webinars on cloud security;</li>
<li>We’ll do more on VMware NSX: Matthias Luft will talk about attacking NSX-T in a few days, I’ll do NSX-T deep dive (similar to what I did for NSX-V in 2018) and Mitja Robas will talk about NSX-V design and planning;</li>
<li>We hope Mitja will have time to do Cisco ACI deep dive;</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll also start a completely new series focused on networking fundamentals – not the usual “introduction to technology” or “this is how you configure stuff” things (there’s plenty of material out there doing that) but focusing on <em>why </em>things work the way they do and the true fundamentals of networking, including related math challenges:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Rachel Traylor will continue her series of math-in-networking webinars with queuing theory and in-depth discussions of graphs and reliability;</li>
<li>I’ll do a series of webinars on networking fundamentals, starting with <em>Business aspects of networking</em> and <em>Why should you care about networking </em>and then slowly working up the stack. Expect this to be a multi-year effort ending with <em>Dead Technologies and Why They Died.</em></li>
<li>Dinesh Dutt will complement that material with Open Networking webinars explaining how to do networking on Linux and Linux-based network devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, here’s a list of things we <em>might </em>do:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Networking in Kubernetes;</li>
<li>OpenStack networking;</li>
<li>Product-specific SD-WAN webinars (Viptela and Velocloud come to mind);</li>
<li>IPv6 deployment experiences;</li>
<li>EVPN in Service Provider environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interested in any of these? Have other ideas? Please send me an email or write a comment.</p>
