Here's some feedback I got from a subscriber who got pulled into an SD-WAN project:

> I realized (thanks to you) that it's really important to understand the basics of how things work. It helped me for example at my work when my boss came with the idea "we'll start selling SD-WAN and this is the customer wish list". Looked like business-as-usual until I realized I've never seen so big a difference between reality, customer wishes and what was promised to customer by sales guys I never met. And the networking engineers are supposed to save the day afterwards...

How did your first SD-WAN deployment go? Please write a comment!
