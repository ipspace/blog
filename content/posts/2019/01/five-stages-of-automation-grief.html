title: Five Stages of Automation Grief

<p>As I’m doing occasional consulting for large enterprises redesigning their data centers, I encounter a wide range of network automation readiness, from <em>“we don’t need that”</em> to <em>“how could we automate as much as possible”</em>.</p>
<p>Based on the pervasiveness of “<em>we don’t need that” </em>responses it looks like many enterprise network engineers still have to go through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_Z3lmidmrY">five stages</a> of automation grief.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Denial</strong>. I don’t need automation. Our network doesn’t change that much, and it’s perfectly OK to configure devices by hand. We’ve always been doing it this way, and it was fine.</p>
<p><strong>Anger</strong>. Why is everyone talking about this new stuff? Why should I learn something new after studying networking for a decade?</p>
<p><strong>Bargaining</strong>. Maybe I don’t need automation. Maybe I can buy an <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/06/what-is-intent-based-networking.html">intent-based</a> or software-defined product from my $vendor and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/05/layers-of-single-pane-of-glass.html">continue using GUI</a>… or maybe I could do <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/03/dunning-kruger-in-it-infrastructure.html">a bit of Google-and-paste and get something done</a>.</p>
<p>Needless to say, $vendors love engineers being stuck in this phase… and well-meaning evangelists explaining how easy it is to automate stuff (without ever telling you about the hard parts like <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutSol&amp;module=3">source-of-truth or data models</a>) inadvertently help creating either <a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/">Expert Beginners</a> that stay stuck at this phase forever (while thinking they really nailed it) or <a href="https://aldrinisaac.blogspot.com/2018/12/death-by-thousand-scripts.html">death by a thousand scripts</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Depression</strong>. It’s so complex. I have to learn all this new stuff. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/9fhvyl/writing_yaml/">I hate YAML</a>. Jinja2 is really a pile of crap. Network devices suck… <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/04/lets-drop-some-random-commands-shall-we.html">even SSH doesn’t work reliably</a>. Why couldn’t my $vendor give me a clean API returning the data I need (hint: <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2016/10/network-automation-rfp-requirements.html">because you chose the wrong vendor</a> ;).</p>
<p><strong>Acceptance</strong>. Damn it, I’m an engineer. I can make it work. I’ll work hard, master new stuff, and get it done. After all, if I managed to get to the point where I can design and deploy complex networks, I might be able to team with a programmer (or an automation expert) and slowly build something useful.</p>
<p>Hundreds of networking engineers found out that they could get great results once they get to the acceptance phase by following a structured program instead of trying to figure things out on their own. <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutUC">Here are a few success stories</a> from those that enrolled in <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course.
