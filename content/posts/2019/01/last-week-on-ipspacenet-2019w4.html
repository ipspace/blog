<p>The crazy pace of webinar sessions continued last week. <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Howard_Marks">Howard Marks</a> continued his <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Hyper-Converged_Infrastructure_Deep_Dive">deep dive into Hyper-Converged Infrastructure</a>, this time focusing on go-to-market strategies, failure resiliency with replicas and local RAID, and the eternal debate (if you happen to be working for a certain $vendor) <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/HCI/2.3%20-%20Kernel%20versus%20VM%20HCI.mp4">whether it’s better to run your HCI code in a VM and not in hypervisor kernel</a> like your competitor does. He concluded with the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=HCI#PLAYERS">description of what major players (VMware VSAN, Nutanix and HPE Simplivity) do</a>.</p>
<p>On Thursday I started my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible 2.7 Updates saga</a>, describing how <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Ansible/N1.1%20-%20Connecting%20to%20Network%20Devices.mp4"><strong>network_cli </strong>plugin works</a>, how they implemented <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Ansible/N0.2%20-%20Generic%20Networking%20Modules.mp4">generic CLI modules</a>, how to use <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Ansible/N1.2%20-%20Authenticating%20Ansible%20User%20on%20Network%20Devices.mp4">SSH keys or usernames and passwords for authentication</a> (and how to make them secure), and how to <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Ansible/N2.1%20-%20Executing%20Commands%20on%20Network%20Devices.mp4">execute commands on network devices</a> (including an introduction into the gory details of parsing text outputs, JSON or XML). </p>
<p>The last thing I managed to cover was the <strong>cli_command </strong>module and how you can use it to execute any command on a network device… and then I ran out of time. We’ll continue with sample playbooks and network device configurations on February 12<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>You can get access to both webinars with <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">Standard ipSpace.net subscription</a>.</p>
