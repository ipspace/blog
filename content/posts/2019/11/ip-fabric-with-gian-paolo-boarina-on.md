No, we were not talking about IP fabrics in general - [**IP Fabric**](https://ipfabric.io/) is a network management software (oops, *network assurance platform*) Gian Paolo [discovered a while ago](https://www.ifconfig.it/hugo/2019/10/ip-fabric-ambassador/) and thoroughly tested in the meantime.

He was kind enough to share what he found in [Episode 107](http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_107-IP_Fabric.mp3) of [Software Gone Wild](https://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild/), and as Chris Young succinctly summarized: "*it's really sad what we still get excited about something 30 years after it was first promised*"... but maybe this time it really works ;)
