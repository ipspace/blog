Remember the "[BGP as High Availability Protocol](/2019/01/bgp-as-high-availability-protocol/)" article [Nicola Modena](https://www.ipspace.net/Expert:Nicola_Modena) wrote a few months ago? He finally found time to extend it with [BGP design considerations](/kb/BGPHighAvailability/10-BGP-Design/) and a description of a [seamless-and-safe firewall software upgrade procedure](/kb/BGPHighAvailability/20-Firewall-Upgrade/).
