<p>Another great advice from <a href="https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy">Charity Majors</a>: <a href="https://charity.wtf/2019/11/23/questionable-advice-after-being-a-manager-can-i-be-happy-as-a-cog/">does it make sense to go back to being an engineer after being a manager for a few years</a>?</p>
<p>Personal note: finding a great replacement for my CTO role was probably the best professional decision I ever made ;)</p>
