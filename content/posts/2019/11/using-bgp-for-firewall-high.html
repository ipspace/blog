<p>Remember the “<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/01/bgp-as-high-availability-protocol.html">BGP as High Availability Protocol</a>” article <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Expert:Nicola_Modena">Nicola Modena</a> wrote a few months ago? He finally found time to extend it with <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/kb/BGPHighAvailability/10-BGP-Design.html">BGP design considerations</a> and a description of a <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/kb/BGPHighAvailability/20-Firewall-Upgrade.html">seamless-and-safe firewall software upgrade procedure</a>.</p>
