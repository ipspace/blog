<p>Russ White wrote a great blog post <a href="https://rule11.tech/about-that-easy-button/">explaining why you have to understand the problem you’re solving instead of blindly believing the $vendor slide deck</a>… or as I said a long time ago, think about how you’ll <a href="/2018/02/how-self-sufficient-do-you-want-to-be/">troubleshoot your network</a> in because you <a href="/2015/11/can-you-afford-to-reformat-your-data/">won’t be able to reformat</a> it once it crashes.<!--more--></p>
<p>Unfortunately I’m pretty sure that people buying <a href="/2018/02/single-image-systems-or-automated/">shrink-wrapped integrated solutions</a> don’t care about what Russ or myself have to say, it’s much easier to <a href="/2016/01/the-sad-state-of-enterprise-networking/">believe in Santa Claus</a> and <a href="/2019/04/shifting-responsibility-in-network/">blame the vendor</a> when the brown substance hits the fan.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you <a href="/2015/03/you-must-understand-fundamentals-to-be/">want to understand how networking really works</a> we’re working on materials that will help you get there - we plan to have Dinesh Dutt delve into interesting aspects of open networking that vendors usually don’t talk about, and I started my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work">How Networking Technologies Really Works</a> series in June 2019 (check out the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Net101#CHALLENGES">public videos</a> available with <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free">free ipSpace.net subscription</a>).</p>
