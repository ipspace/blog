<p>Original TCP/IP and OSI network stacks had <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/11/video-putting-networking-layers-together.html">relatively clean layered architecture</a> (forgetting the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/09/response-osi-model-is-lie.html">battle scars</a> for the moment) and relied on end-to-end principle to keep the network core simple.</p>
<p>As always, no good deed goes unpunished - “creative” individuals trying to <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/this-is-what-makes-networking-so-complex.html">force-fit their mis-designed star-shaped pegs into round holes</a>, and networking vendors <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/11/stretched-vlans-and-failing-firewall.html">looking for competitive advantage</a> quickly <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/L2.5%20-%20Breaking%20the%20End-to-End%20Principle.mp4?doccode=Net101">destroyed the idea with tons of middlebox devices</a>, ranging from firewalls and load balancers to NAT, WAN optimization, and DPI monstrosities.</p>
