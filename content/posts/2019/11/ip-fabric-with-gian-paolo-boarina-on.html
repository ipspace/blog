<p>No, we were not talking about IP fabrics in general - <a href="https://ipfabric.io/"><strong>IP Fabric</strong></a> is a network management software (oops, <em>network assurance platform</em>) Gian Paolo <a href="https://www.ifconfig.it/hugo/2019/10/ip-fabric-ambassador/">discovered a while ago</a> and thoroughly tested in the meantime.</p>
<p>He was kind enough to share what he found in <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_107-IP_Fabric.mp3">Episode 107</a> of <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild/">Software Gone Wild</a>, and as Chris Young succinctly summarized: “<em>it’s really sad what we still get excited about something 30 years after it was first promised</em>”… but maybe this time it really works ;)</p>
