Original TCP/IP and OSI network stacks had [relatively clean layered architecture](/2019/11/video-putting-networking-layers-together/) (forgetting the [battle scars](/2019/09/response-osi-model-is-lie/) for the moment) and relied on end-to-end principle to keep the network core simple.

As always, no good deed goes unpunished - "creative" individuals trying to [force-fit their misdesigned star-shaped pegs into round holes](/2013/04/this-is-what-makes-networking-so-complex/), and networking vendors [looking for competitive advantage](/2019/11/stretched-vlans-and-failing-firewall/) quickly [destroyed the idea with tons of middlebox devices](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/L2.5%20-%20Breaking%20the%20End-to-End%20Principle.mp4?doccode=Net101), ranging from firewalls and load balancers to NAT, WAN optimization, and DPI monstrosities.
