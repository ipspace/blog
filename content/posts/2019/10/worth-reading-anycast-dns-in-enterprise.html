<p>Anycast (advertising the same IP address from multiple servers/locations) has long been used to implement scale-out public DNS services (the whole root DNS system runs on massive anycast), but itâ€™s not as common in enterprise networks.</p>
<p>The blog posts written by Tom Bowles should get you there. He started with <a href="https://medium.com/@tom.bowles/anycast-dns-part-1-838033773af8">the idea</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@tom.bowles/anycast-dns-part-2-4acc51e4d64f">described his implementation using Infoblox DNS</a>.</p>

I covered <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DC30#LOAD_BALANCING">numerous load balancing mechanisms</a> including anycast in <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Infrastructure_for_Networking_Engineers">Data Centers Infrastructure for Networking Engineers</a> webinar.</p>
