[Grouping the features needed in a networking stack in a bunch of layered modules](/2019/09/video-need-for-network-layers/) is a great idea. Unfortunately, you could place several essential features like error recovery, retransmission, and flow control in several different layers, from the *data link layer* dealing with individual network segments, to the *transport layer* dealing with reliable end-to-end transmissions.

Where should we put those modules? As always, the correct answer is *it depends*, in this particular case, on transmission reliability, latency, and bandwidth cost. You'll find more details in the [Retransmissions and Flow Control](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/L2.2%20-%20Retransmissions%20and%20Flow%20Control.mp4?doccode=Net101) part of [How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work) webinar.
