<p>Everyone is talking about <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/FRRouting_Architecture_and_Features">FRRouting suite</a> these days, while hidden somewhere in the background <a href="http://www.openbgpd.org/">OpenBGPD</a> has been making continuous progress for years. Interestingly, OpenBGPD project was started for the same reason FRR was forked - developers were unhappy with Zebra or Quagga routing suite and decided to fix it.</p>
<p>We discussed the history of OpenBGPD, its current deployments and future plans with <a href="https://www.netnod.se/claudio-jeker">Claudio Jeker</a>, one of the main OpenBGPD developers, in <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_106-OpenBGP.mp3">Episode 106</a> of <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild/">Software Gone Wild</a>.</p>
