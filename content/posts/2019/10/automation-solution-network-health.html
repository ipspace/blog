<p>How nice would it be to have a fabric health dashboard displaying a summary of numerous parameters you’re interested in (number of operational uplinks, number of BGP sessions…) for every switch in your fabric.</p>
<p>I’m positive you could hack something together using the customization capabilities of your favorite network management system… or you could <a href="https://github.com/sjhloco/ip_auto_lab/tree/master/network_state_report">write a simple data gathering solution</a> like Stephen Harding did while attending the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course.</p>
<div class="info" data-markdown="1">I collected <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/NetAutSol/Solutions">dozens of automation solutions</a> created by course attendees in the last few years. Enjoy! </div>
