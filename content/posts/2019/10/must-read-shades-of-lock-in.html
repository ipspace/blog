<p>Gregor Hohpe published an <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/oss-lockin.html">excellent series</a> on Martin Fowler’s web site focusing on various aspects of lock-in. If nothing else, you SHOULD read the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/oss-lockin.html#ShadesOfLock-in">shades of lock-in</a> part, and combine it with <a href="/2015/01/lock-in-is-inevitable-get-used-to-it.html">my thoughts on lock-in in data center networking</a>.</p>
