<p>One of my subscribers was interested in trying out whitebox solutions. He wrote:</p>
<p class="cite">What open source/whitebox software/hardware should I look at if I wanted to build a leaf-and-spine VXLAN/EVPN/BGP data center.</p>
<p>I don’t think you can get a fully-open-source solution because the ASIC manufacturers hide their SDK behind a mountain of NDAs (that strategy must <a href="https://packetpushers.net/industry-needs-open-source-framework-switching-silicon/">make perfect sense</a> – after all, it generated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVpOyKCNZYw">such awesome PR for NVIDIA</a>). Anyway, the closest you can get (AFAIK) if you're a mere mortal is Cumulus Linux, and you just choose any whitebox hardware off their Hardware Compatibility List.<!--more--></p>
<p class="cite">I also want to look into open source/white label for my firewalling needs, DMVPN over mGRE, and SD-WAN needs.</p>
<p>Apart from few firewall manufacturers touting their awesome ASICs nobody does firewalling in hardware, so all you need is an x86 server and an open-source firewall (suggestions welcome: please write a comment).</p>
<p>Modern open-source IPsec implementations already use AES-NI instruction set, so you could say you’re using whitebox hardware for your IPsec implementation even when you’re running OpenVPN on an x86 server.</p>
<p>DMVPN is proprietary as are all SD-WAN solutions so no luck there, although someone recently wrote about <a href="https://flexiwan.com/what-is-sd-wan-open-source-building-blocks/">open-source SD-WAN solution</a>. Had no time to dig deeper, and maybe they do have a high-quality open-source implementation, but their whitepaper is so buzzword-loaded that my BS detector experienced immediate overload.</p>
