<p>I don’t remember who pointed me to the excellent <a href="http://web.mit.edu/2.75/resources/random/How%20Complex%20Systems%20Fail.pdf">How Complex Systems Fail</a> document. It’s almost like RFC1925 – I could quote it all day long, and anyone dealing with large mission-critical distributed systems (hint: networks) should read it once a day ;))</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
