<p>A few months ago Johannes Weber sent me a short email saying “<em>hey, I plan to write a few NTP posts</em>” and I replied “<em>well, ping me when you have something ready</em>”.</p>
<p>In the meantime he wrote a veritable NTP bible - a series of <a href="https://blog.webernetz.net/ntp/">NTP-related blog posts</a> covering everything from <em><a href="https://blog.webernetz.net/why-should-i-run-own-ntp-servers/">Why Should I Run My Own NTP Servers</a></em> to authentication, security and monitoring - definitely a MUST READ if you care about knowing what time it is.</p>
