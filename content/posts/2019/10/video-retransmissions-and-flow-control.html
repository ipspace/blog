<p><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/09/video-need-for-network-layers.html">Grouping the features needed in a networking stack in bunch of layered modules</a> is a great idea, but unfortunately it turns out that you could place a number of important features like error recovery, retransmission and flow control in a number of different layers, from <em>data link layer</em> dealing with individual network segments to <em>transport layer</em> dealing with reliable end-to-end transmissions.</p>
<p>So where should we put those modules? As always, the correct answer is <em>it depends</em>, in this particular case on transmission reliability, latency, and cost of bandwidth. Youâ€™ll find more details in the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/L2.2%20-%20Retransmissions%20and%20Flow%20Control.mp4?doccode=Net101">Retransmissions and Flow Control</a> part of <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work">How Networks Really Work</a> webinar.</p>
