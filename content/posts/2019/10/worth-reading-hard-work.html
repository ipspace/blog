<p>Seth Godin published an <a href="https://seths.blog/2019/02/hard-work/">interesting article on the value of hard work</a> (and what <em>hard work</em> really is). Go and read it first, then we’ll translate it into networking terms.</p>
<p>Already back? Good, let’s go.</p>
<p>The first worker is a traditional networking technician (it wouldn’t be fair to call him an engineer) – he’s busy configuring VLANs, ACLs, firewall rules… the whole day.<!--more--></p>
<p>The second worker discovered automation – he somehow got tools that make him work faster and help him be more reliable and consistent.</p>
<p>And then there’s the third type of company Seth mentioned: those that figured out they need tools well in advance and decided to invest into acquiring or <a href="/2014/08/toolsmith-netflix-on-software-gone-wild.html">building them</a>… and if they’re really smart, they would know that better-trained workers use the tools more optimally, but that’s already stretching it a bit, right?</p>
