<p>You probably heard me say “networking engineer encountering a public cloud feels like Alice in Wonderland” - packet forwarding works in a different way in every public cloud, subnets are a mix between routed interfaces and VRFs, you cannot change IP addresses without involving the orchestration system…</p>
<p>We covered the networking aspects of Amazon Web Services and Azure in our <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Cloud">cloud webinars</a>, but you might need a bigger picture:<!--more--></p>
<ul><li>How do you integrate public cloud with your existing data centers or WAN infrastructure?</li>
<li>How do you build high-availability architectures using public cloud resources?</li>
<li>How do you automate cloud deployments to make them consistent and repeatable?</li>
<li>How do you implement traditional network services (firewalling and load balancing) needed by your legacy applications in public clouds?</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally (in case you get involved in those discussions), how do you re-architect existing applications to make them work better in public clouds?</p>
<p>We’ll address all these topics in the new <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/PubCloud/">Networking in Public Cloud Deployments</a> online course starting in February 2020… and all you have to do is to <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/PubCloud/#register">register today</a>.</p>
