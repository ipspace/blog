Anycast (advertising the same IP address from multiple servers/locations) has long been used to implement scale-out public DNS services (the whole root DNS system runs on massive anycast), but it's not as common in enterprise networks.

The blog posts written by Tom Bowles should get you there. He started with [the idea](https://medium.com/@tom.bowles/anycast-dns-part-1-838033773af8) and [described his implementation using Infoblox DNS](https://medium.com/@tom.bowles/anycast-dns-part-2-4acc51e4d64f).

Want to know even more? I covered [numerous load balancing mechanisms](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DC30#LOAD_BALANCING) including anycast in [Data Centers Infrastructure for Networking Engineers](https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Infrastructure_for_Networking_Engineers) webinar.
