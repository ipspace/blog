Here's another masterpiece by Charity Majors: [Why I hate the phrase &#8220;breaking down silos](https://charity.wtf/2021/08/27/why-i-hate-the-phrase-breaking-down-silos/). A teaser in case you can't decide whether to click the link:

> When someone says they are “breaking down silos”, whether in an interview, a panel, or casual conversation, it tells me jack shit about what they actually did.

Enjoy ;)
