I loved the Time Dilation blog post by Seth Godin. It explains so much, including why I won't accept a "*quick conf call to touch base and hash out ideas*" from someone coming out of the blue sky -- why should I be interested if they can't invest the time to organize their thoughts and pour them into an email.

The concept of "creation-to-consumption" ratio is also interesting. Now I understand why I hate unedited opinionated chinwagging (many podcasts sadly fall into this category) or videos where someone blabbers into a camera while visibly trying to organize their thoughts.

Just FYI, these are some of the typical ratios I had to deal in the past:
<!--more-->
* **Edited podcast**: 3:1 to 5:1, depending on how much time you put into preparation. Editing also cuts down the length of the chat by 10-20%.
* **Presentations or videos using slide decks**: around 8:1 to 10:1 just to create the content (research is extra). Another 10:1 to deliver, edit, register, and publish. Good editing is a huge time sink, but it can reduce the presentation time by up to 30%, resulting in even higher ratio.
* **Writing blog posts**: never measured it, but consider it takes me around an hour to write a decent blog post, probably around 10:1 (depending on how fast you read ;).
* **Slide decks with student notes**: We used 30:1 when developing course materials -- around 30 developer days are spent developing a single day of training materials.
* **Writing books**: Even more than 30:1, considering the fact that most of us read faster than talk -- another source of annoyance when I have to listen to videos which add no value beyond someone talking about things that would be better put in writing.
