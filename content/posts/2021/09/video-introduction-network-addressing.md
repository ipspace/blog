A friend of mine pointed out [this quote by John Shoch](https://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien19.txt) when I started preparing the [Network Stack Addressing slide deck](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/Network%20Stack%20Addressing.pdf?doccode=Net101) for my [How Networks Really Work webinar](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work):

> The *name* of a resource indicates **what** we seek, an *address* indicates **where** it is, and a *route* tells us **how to get there**.

You might wonder when that document was written... it's from January 1978. They got it absolutely right 42 years ago, and we completely messed it up in the meantime with the crazy ideas of making IP addresses resource identifiers.

Imagine that you'd be identified by the street address at which you were born, and had to carry that address around (and update Google Maps) every time you decided to travel. How crazy is that... and yet that's exactly how [some application developers love to think of the world our servers live](https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/11/typical-enterprise-application.html) in, and what virtualization vendors managed to persuade sysadmins makes perfect sense. No wonder [networking is as complex as it can get](https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/this-is-what-makes-networking-so-complex.html) before [collapsing in a smoldering pile of kludges](https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/10/disaster-recovery-faking-take-two.html).
