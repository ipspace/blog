As early as 1994 (on April 1st, to be precise) a satire [disguised as an Informational RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1606) was published describing the deployment of IPv9 in a parallel universe.

Any similarity with a protocol that started as a [second-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect) academic idea and is still experiencing hiccups in real world even though it could order its own beer in US is purely coincidental.
