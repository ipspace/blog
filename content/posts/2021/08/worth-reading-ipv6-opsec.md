After almost a decade of bickering and haggling (trust me, I [got my scars](https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/02/rfc-7454-bgp-operations-and-security.html) to prove how the *consensus building* works), the authors of [Operational Security Considerations for IPv6 Networks](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9099) (many of them dear old friends I haven't seen for way too long) finally managed to turn a brilliant document into an Informational RFC. 

Regardless of whether you already implemented IPv6 in your network or believe it will never be production-ready (alongside other crazy stuff like vaccines) I'd consider this RFC a mandatory reading.
