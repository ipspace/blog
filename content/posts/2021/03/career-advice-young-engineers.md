David Bombal invited me for another short chat -- this time on what I recommend young networking engineers just starting their career. As I did a bit of a research I stumbled upon some great recommendations on Quora:

* [How to identify a good electrical engineer](https://www.quora.com/q/amaderelectronics/How-do-I-identify-a-good-electrical-engineer-1)
* [What advice would you give young engineers early in their career?](https://www.quora.com/What-advice-would-you-give-young-engineers-early-in-their-career/answer/Steve-Heckman-1)
* [What are the most important things of working as an engineer that nobody mentioned in college?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-important-things-of-working-as-an-engineer-that-nobody-mentioned-in-college/answer/Steve-Heckman-1)

I couldn't save the pages to Internet Archive (looks like it's not friendly with Quora), so I can only hope they won't disappear ;)
