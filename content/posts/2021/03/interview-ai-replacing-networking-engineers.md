In the [second half of my chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKpyXPqfxIc) with [David Bombal](https://davidbombal.com/) we focused on automation and AI in networking. Even though we discussed many things, including the dangers of doing a repeatable job, and how to make yourself unique, David chose a nice click-bait headline *Will AI Replace the Networking Engineers?*. According to *[Betteridge's law of headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines)* the answer is still *NO*, but it's obvious AI will replace the low-level easy-to-automate jobs (as [textile workers found out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite) almost 200 years ago).

While pondering that statement, keep in mind that AI is more than just machine learning (the overhyped stuff). According to one loose definition, "_Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions_"

{{<note warn>}}Full disclosure: the web site with this definition had and ad for Lego Friends set next to it, making it extra-trusty. I couldn't find a similarly oversimplified definition on Wikipedia... probably for a good reason.{{</note>}}

Anyway, following the [tongue-in-cheek tradition of James Mickens](https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/10/worth-watching-machine-learning-in.html), here's what's hidden behind the AI curtain (among [other things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_tools_for_artificial_intelligence)):

![](pay-no-attention-to-the-agenda-behind-the-curtain.jpg)

* **Expert systems**: decision trees with a glamorous veneer.
* **Fuzzy logic**: the same decision trees using probabilities instead of yes/no branching.
* **Machine learning**: turning trees into a spaghetti mess while fiddling with random probabilities in decision pasta to meet the expectations of whoever put together the training data ([slightly more serious explanation](https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/01/worth-reading-machine-learning-explained.html)).

While I [remain skeptical about the general applicability of the third approach](https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/03/machine-learning-in-networking-products.html) (even though it [does have some interesting use cases](https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/09/dns-with-machine-learning.html)), it's obvious that it makes perfect sense to convert some of the level-1 TAC procedures into an automated decision tree. [Residential IPv6 troubleshooting](https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/04/troubleshooting-residential-ipv6.html) project was in production in 2014 (unfortunately without the marketing machinery of a major vendor or VC backing), and I'm positive there are tons of similar problems out there just waiting to be solved (as opposed to being marketized by a [disruptive startup](https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/10/the-cost-of-disruptiveness-and.html)).

Anyway, just in case you want to watch our rants, [here's the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKpyXPqfxIc).
