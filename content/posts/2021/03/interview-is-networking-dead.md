A few weeks ago I enjoyed a long-overdue chat with [David Bombal](https://davidbombal.com/). David published the first part of it under the click-bait headline *Is Networking Dead* (he renamed it *Is There any Future for Networking Engineers* in the meantime).

According to *[Betteridge's law of headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines)* the answer to his original headline is *NO* (and the second headline violates that law -- there you go 🤷‍♂️). If you're still interested in the details, [watch the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzooeiGxKis).
