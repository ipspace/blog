In the previous video in this series, I [described how path discovery works](/2021/02/video-finding-paths-across-network.html) in source routing and virtual circuit environments. I couldn't squeeze the discussion of hop-by-hop forwarding into the same video (it would make the video way too long); you'll find it in the [next video](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/SW5%20-%20Transparent%20Bridging%20and%20Routing.mp4?doccode=Net101) in the [same section](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Net101#SWITCH).
