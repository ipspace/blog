Here's a message I got from one of my subscribers (probably based on one of my [recent public cloud rants](https://twitter.com/ioshints/status/1368601005424861191)):

I often think the cloud stuff has been sent to try us in IT -- the struggle could be tough enough when we were dealing with waterfall development and monolithic projects. When products took years to develop, and years to understand.  

And now we're being asked to be agile and learn new stuff all the time about moving targets that barely have documentation at all, never mind accurate doco! We had obviously got into our comfort zone and needed shaking out of it!

Always interested to hear your experiences with the cloud networking though -- it's what I subscribed to ipspace.net for TBH as I think it's the most complete reference source for that purpose and a vital part of enterprise networking these days!

It's always extremely nice to hear someone finds your work valuable ;) Thanks a million!
