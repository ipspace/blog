The one and only Avery Pennarun (of the *[world in which IPv6 was a good design](https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/03/world-in-which-ipv6-was-good-design.html)* fame) is back with another absolutely-must-read article explaining how various archetypes apply to real-world challenges, including:

* Hierarchies and decentralization (and why decentralization is a myth)
* Chicken-and-egg problem (and why some good things fail)
* Second-system effect (or why it's better to refactor than to rewrite)
* Innovator's dilemma (or why large corporations become obsolete)

If you think none of these applies to networking, you're probably wrong... but of course please write a comment if you still feel that way after reading Avery's article.
