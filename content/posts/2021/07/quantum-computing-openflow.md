I read [an excellent rant by prof. Victor Galitski](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/quantum-computing-hype-bad-science-victor-galitski-1c) describing the current explosion of Quantum Computing hype, and couldn't help being reminded of the [OpenFlow brouhaha](/2011/03/open-networking-foundation-fabric/) we experienced almost a decade ago -- you could do a simple search-and-replace and the article would have been equally valid.

Enjoy... and remember the details for the next time your beloved vendor comes along with Quantum Computing slide deck.
