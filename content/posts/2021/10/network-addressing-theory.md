After explaining the [basics of (network) names, addresses and routes](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/09/video-introduction-network-addressing.html), I [wasted a few minutes of everyone's time discussing the theoretical aspects of layered addressing](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/NA1.2%20-%20Theoretical%20View%20of%20Network%20Addressing.mp4?doccode=Net101), and then got back to practical issues like address scopes, namespaces, and address provisioning.

The video ends with a simple (and unappreciated) truth: if you have a point-to-point link between two nodes you don't need data-link-layer addresses. The consequences of that fact are left as an exercise for the viewer (or you can wait till the next video ;)
