Even though you need plenty of traditional networking constructs to deploy a complex application stack in a public cloud (packet filters, firewalls, load balancers, VPN, BGP...), once you start digging deep into the bowels of public cloud virtual networking, you'll find out it's significantly different from the traditional Ethernet+IP implementations common in enterprise data centers.

For an overview of the differences watch the *[Public Cloud Networking Is Different](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Cloud101/8.2%20-%20Public%20Cloud%20Networking%20Is%20Different.mp4?doccode=Cloud101)* video (part of [Introduction to Cloud Computing](https://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Cloud_Computing) webinar), for more details start with [AWS Networking 101](https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/05/aws-networking-101.html) and [Azure Networking 101](https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/05/azure-networking-101.html) blog posts, and continue with corresponding [cloud networking](https://www.ipspace.net/Cloud) webinars.
