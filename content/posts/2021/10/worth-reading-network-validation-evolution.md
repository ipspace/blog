title: 'Worth Reading: Network Validation Evolution at Hostinger'

Network validation is becoming another overhyped buzzword with many opinionated pundits talking about it and few environments using it in practice (why am I not surprised?)

As always, there are exceptions. They don't have to be members of the FAANG club, and some of them get the job done with open-source tools [regardless of what vendor marketers would like you to believe](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/10/democratizing-network-automation.html). For example, Donatas Abraitis [described how the Hostinger networking team gradually implemented network validation](https://www.hostinger.com/blog/network-validation-evolution-at-hostinger) using Cumulus VX, Vagrant, SuzieQ, PyTest and Test Kitchen. Enjoy!
