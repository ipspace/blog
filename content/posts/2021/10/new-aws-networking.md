Last week's update session of the [AWS Networking](https://www.ipspace.net/Amazon_Web_Services_Networking) webinar covered two hours worth of new (or not-yet-covered) features, including:

* Transit Gateway Connect functionality (GRE tunnel+BGP between Transit Gateway and in-cloud SD-WAN appliances)
* AWS Private Link
* Intra-VPC static routes that you can use to send inter-subnet traffic to a BYOD security appliance
* IGMPv2 support
* Custom global accelerators
* Assigning whole IP prefixes to VM interfaces

The recordings have already been published, either as independent videos or integrated with the existing materials. Enjoy ;)
