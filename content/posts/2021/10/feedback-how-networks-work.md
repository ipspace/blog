A few weeks ago I asked my subscribers which webinar they'd like to see in November (thanks a million to everyone who replied!). Not surprisingly, [network automation](https://www.ipspace.net/Network_Automation_Concepts) got the top spot, but I was a bit sad to see my long-term pet project at the bottom of the list:

On the other hand, there are people enjoying relearning the fundamentals. This is what [Christopher had to say](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work#Happy_Campers) about the *[How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work)* webinar:

> Ivan has much to say on any topic. He clearly enjoys and explores his subject. I'm working through Nokia SROS from the ground-up at the moment after a career of Cisco and Juniper in ISP environments and a 2 year hiatus where I forgot it all. Ivan is bringing it all back to life for me and renewing my interest.

Parts of that webinar are already available with [Free ipSpace.net subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free). You need [Standard or Expert ipSpace.net Subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual) to watch the whole webinar or attend the live sessions.
