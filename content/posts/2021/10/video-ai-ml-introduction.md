In May 2021, [Javier Antich](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Javier_Antich) ran a great webinar explaining the [principles of Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning and how they apply (or not) to networking](https://www.ipspace.net/AI_and_ML_in_Networking).

He started with a [brief overview of AI/ML hype](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/AI/1%20-%20Introduction.mp4?doccode=AI) that should help you understand why there's a bit of a difference between self-driving cars (not that we got there) and self-driving networks.
