[Etienne-Victor Depasquale](https://www.um.edu.mt/profile/etiennedepasquale) sent me a pointer to an interesting NANOG discussion: [why would we need Segment Routing](https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2020-June/108345.html). It's well worth reading the whole thread (until it devolves into "_that is not how MPLS works_" arguments), which happens to be somewhat aligned with my thinking:

* SR-MPLS makes perfect sense (excluding the migration-from-LDP fun)
* SRv6 (in whatever incantation) is mostly a vendor ploy to sell new chipsets.

Enjoy!
