I wanted to cover fast failover (at least the basics and Prefix Independent Convergence -- PIC) in another live session of _[How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work)_ webinar in 2021, but unfortunately I ran out of time.

As a teaser, you might want to watch the recording of *[Fast Failover: Marketing and Reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U3Nmrz6DMg&t=2192s)* presentation I had at the [Seventh RSNOG Conference](https://rsnog.rs/events/seventh-rsnog-conference/?lang=en).
