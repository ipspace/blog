In his [latest blog post](https://networkingnerd.net/2021/12/10/is-disaggregation-going-to-be-cord-cutting-for-the-enterprise/), Tom Hollingsworth compares network device disaggregations with cord cutting (replacing cable TV subscription with Netflix and friends), and comes to the inevitable conclusion:

> The idea is that you gain freedom and cheaper software. The hope is that you can build an enterprise network for half of what it would normally cost. The reality is that you’re going to gain less functionality and spend more time integrating things together on your own instead of just putting in a turnkey solution.

To rephrase it, you'll design a snowflake network with snowflake devices. Good job -- just because it makes sense for the FAANG club ([or LinkedIn](/2016/09/whitebox-switching-at-linkedin-with/)), it [doesn't mean you should be doing it](/2016/03/you-want-your-network-to-be-like/).
