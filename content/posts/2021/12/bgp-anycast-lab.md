The _[Anycast Works Just Fine with MPLS/LDP](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/11/anycast-mpls.html)_ blog post generated so much interest that I decided to check a few similar things, including running BGP-based anycast over a BGP-free core, and using BGP Labeled Unicast (BGP-LU).

### The Big Picture

We'll use the same physical topology we used in the [OSPF+MPLS anycast example](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/11/anycast-mpls.html): a leaf-and-spine fabric (admittedly with a single spine) with three anycast servers advertising 10.42.42.42/32 attached to two of the leafs:

{{<figure src="/2021/12/anycast-lab.jpg" caption="Lab topology">}}

We'll use BGP as the endpoint reachability protocol and OSPF as the core IGP:

* Switches run OSPF on the core links and belong to BGP AS 65000
* Spine switch is also a BGP route reflectors[^RRMore]
* Leaf switches are route reflector clients
* IBGP sessions follow the physical fabric topology
* Anycast servers run only BGP. They are in AS 65101
* There are EBGP sessions between anycast servers and adjacent switches. There are no IBGP sessions between the anycast servers.

[^RRMore]: In a real network you'd have more than one spine switch, and they would all be route reflectors for redundancy reasons.

{{<figure src="/2021/12/bgp-anycast-sessions.png" caption="BGP sessions in the BGP anycast lab">}}

**Ideal end result**: three equal-cost paths toward the anycast prefix on L1 and S1.

**Acceptable end result**: three equal-cost paths toward the anycast prefix on S1. All traffic from L1 has to go through S1 anyway (although that won't be the case once we turn on MPLS).

**Backup plan**: 2-to-1 traffic split between L2 and L3 on S1 (and hopefully on L1).

### Building the Lab Topology File

Before digging into the details: a friend of mine was reading this blog post and said "_it looks like you have to turn a lot of nerd knobs to set it up_". He's right, but do keep in mind that the end result is a fully configured lab running OSPF, EBGP, IBGP, and BGP RR.

Ready? Let's go!

We'll start with the [lab topology file we used for the OSPF+MPLS lab](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/blob/master/routing/anycast-mpls-ospf/topology.yml), add BGP module, and describe the autonomous systems in the lab with **bgp.as_list** dictionary:

{{<cc>}}Initial topology file{{</cc>}}
```
module: [ ospf, bgp ]

bgp:
  as_list:
    65000:
      members: [ l1, l2, l3, s1 ]
      rr: [ s1 ]
    65101:
      members: [ a1,a2,a3 ]

nodes: 
  [ l1, l2, l3, s1, a1, a2, a3 ]

links: [ s1-l1, s1-l2, s1-l3, l2-a1, l2-a2, l3-a3 ]
```

{{<note>}}The above topology file would result in a full mesh of IBGP sessions between A1, A2, and A3, but we'll ignore them for the moment (more about that later).{{</note>}}

I knew I would have to enable *[BGP Additional Paths](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/12/bgp-multipath-addpath.html)* in AS 65000 to ensure L1 gets multiple paths toward the anycast prefix (we'll need that for the MPLS part), and the easiest way to do that would be to create a group  with a custom deployment template (like I did in the [BGP AddPath lab](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/blob/master/BGP/Multipath/topology.yml)):

{{<cc>}}Defining _network_ and _anycast_ groups{{</cc>}}
```
groups:
  network: 
    members: [ l1, l2, l3, s1  ]
    config: [ bgp-addpath.j2 ]
  anycast: 
    members: [ a1, a2, a3 ]
    config: [ bgp-anycast-loopback.j2 ]
```

The "only" problem with this solution is duplicate data (and you know [I hate that](https://www.ipspace.net/kb/DataModels/)): I'm defining the same groups twice. Wouldn't it be great if the BGP configuration module created groups based on AS membership (as65000 and as65101 in our case).

Sure thing -- *netlab* includes [auto-generated BGP groups](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/groups.html#automatic-bgp-groups) that can also be used to set any other group attribute, simplifying my group definition. I have to define the custom deployment template, and the group members are added by the BGP topology transformation module based on **bgp.as_list** definition.

{{<cc>}}Setting custom deployment templates on auto-generated BGP groups{{</cc>}}
```
groups:
  as65000: 
    config: [ bgp-addpath.j2 ]
  as65101: 
    config: [ bgp-anycast-loopback.j2 ]
```

Next: I'd like to have an anycast attribute somewhere in the topology file instead of a hard-coded anycast prefix in the configuration template. **bgp.anycast** node data seems like a perfect choice, but I'd have to set it on three nodes, replacing my simple list of nodes with a more complex dictionary containing (yet again) duplicate data:

{{<cc>}}Node list is converted into a dictionary to enable node attributes{{</cc>}}
```
nodes: 
  l1:
  l2:
  l3:
  s1:
  a1:
    bgp.anycast: 10.42.42.42/32
  a2:
    bgp.anycast: 10.42.42.42/32
  a3:
    bgp.anycast: 10.42.42.42/32
```

Wouldn't it be nice if I could use an existing group to set an attribute for every node in the group? A few hours later I could define [node data in groups](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/groups.html#setting-node-data-in-groups), simplifying my lab topology back to ([final topology file](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/blob/master/routing/anycast-bgp-addpath/topology.yml)):

{{<cc>}}**bgp.anycast** attribute is set on all nodes in AS 65101{{</cc>}}
```
groups:
  as65000: 
    config: [ bgp-addpath.j2 ]
  as65101: 
    config: [ bgp-anycast-loopback.j2 ]
    node_data:
      bgp.anycast: 10.42.42.42/32

nodes: [ l1, l2, l3, s1, a1, a2, a3 ]
```

Final touch: *netlab* release 1.1 added stricter checks of module- and node data, so I had to tell the tool that I want to use **bgp.anycast** node attribute:

{{<cc>}}Defining a [custom BGP attribute](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extend-attributes.html){{</cc>}}
```
defaults.bgp.extra_attributes.node: [ anycast ]
```

Next step: [Jinja2 template](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/blob/master/routing/anycast-bgp-addpath/bgp-anycast.j2) that uses **bgp.anycast** attribute to configure another loopback interface and advertise it into BGP:

{{<cc>}}Creating a new loopback interface based on **bgp.anycast** node attribute{{</cc>}}
```
{% if bgp is defined and bgp.anycast is defined %}
interface loopback 42
 ip address {{ bgp.anycast|ipaddr('address') }} {{ bgp.anycast|ipaddr('netmask') }}
!
router bgp {{ bgp.as }}
 address-family ipv4
  network {{ bgp.anycast|ipaddr('address') }} mask {{ bgp.anycast|ipaddr('netmask') }}
{% endif %}
```

Finally, I modified the IBGP Add Path template to enable bidirectional *Add Path* functionality within the autonomous system -- we need that to allow the edge routers to send multiple paths to the route reflectors, hoping S1 and L1 will get three BGP paths to the anycast prefix.

{{<cc>}}Simplified IBGP Add Path template{{</cc>}}
```
router bgp {{ bgp.as }}
 address-family ipv4 unicast
  bgp additional-paths select all
  bgp additional-paths send receive
  maximum-paths 16
  maximum-paths ibgp 16
{% for n in bgp.neighbors if n.type == 'ibgp' %}
  neighbor {{ n.ipv4 }} advertise additional-paths all
{% endfor %}
```

### Smoke Test

I started the lab with **netlab up**, waited for a minute for BGP to wake up[^BW] and inspected the BGP table on S1 (the spine node):

{{<cc>}}BGP paths toward the anycast prefix on the route reflector (S1){{</cc>}}
```
s1#show ip bgp 10.42.42.42
BGP routing table entry for 10.42.42.42/32, version 10

      Origin IGP, metric 0, localpref 100, valid, internal
      rx pathid: 0x1, tx pathid: 0

    10.0.0.2 (metric 2) from 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2)
      Origin IGP, metric 0, localpref 100, valid, internal, multipath, best
      rx pathid: 0x0, tx pathid: 0x0
  Path advertised to update-groups:

  Refresh Epoch 1

      Origin IGP, metric 0, localpref 100, valid, internal, multipath(oldest), all
      rx pathid: 0x0, tx pathid: 0x1
```

Wow, almost there. There are three paths in the BGP table on S1 (the route reflector), the only glitch is that one of the paths advertised by L2 is not advertised to route reflector clients (like L1). No wonder, it's identical to the other path advertised by L2. Even worse, it doesn't get installed in the routing table either.

{{<cc>}}Routing table for the anycast prefix on the spine node  (S1){{</cc>}}
```

```

The correct solution to this challenge is to use the [DMZ Link Bandwidth BGP community](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/06/ucmp-bgp-link-bandwidth.html), resulting in our backup plan. Trying to reach the original goal, let's try to fix the problem by turning off the *next-hop-self* on AS edge routers.

### Tweaking the BGP Next Hops

Turning off *next-hop-self* (the default setting) requires quite a bit of [attribute haggling](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module/bgp.html#advanced-global-configuration-parameters) within *netlab* topology file:

* Set **bgp.next_hop_self** to *false*;
* Set **bgp.ebgp_role** to *stub* (default: *external*) to make sure the external subnets are included in the OSPF process;
* Set **bgp.advertise_roles** to an empty list, otherwise we'd get all the external subnets in the BGP table.

The [modified topology file](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/blob/master/routing/anycast-bgp-addpath/topology-external-next-hop.yml) is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/tree/master/routing/anycast-bgp-addpath).

{{<cc>}}Changing global BGP attributes in the topology file to disable **next-hop-self** processing on IBGP sessions{{</cc>}}
```
bgp:
  ebgp_role: stub
  advertise_roles: []
  next_hop_self: false
```

I could log into the individual devices (L2 and L3) and reconfigure them, but it's more convenient (and maybe even faster) to destroy the whole lab with **netlab down** and bring a new lab up with **netlab up**, enjoying a sip of coffee in the meantime.

Here's the BGP table on the route reflector (S1) after the changes to the lab topology file removed the **neighbor next-hop-self** configuration on the AS edge routers:

{{<cc>}}L2 is still changing the BGP next hop, even though **next-hop-self** has not been configured{{</cc>}}
```
s1#sh ip bgp 10.42.42.42
BGP routing table entry for 10.42.42.42/32, version 11
Paths: (3 available, best #3, table default)
Multipath: eBGP iBGP
  Path advertised to update-groups:
     1
  Refresh Epoch 1
  65101, (Received from a RR-client)
    10.1.0.21 (metric 2) from 10.0.0.3 (10.0.0.3)
      Origin IGP, metric 0, localpref 100, valid, internal, multipath(oldest), all
      rx pathid: 0x0, tx pathid: 0x1
  Path not advertised to any peer
  Refresh Epoch 1
  65101, (Received from a RR-client)
    10.0.0.2 (metric 2) from 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2)
      Origin IGP, metric 0, localpref 100, valid, internal
      rx pathid: 0x1, tx pathid: 0
  Path advertised to update-groups:
     1
  Refresh Epoch 1
  65101, (Received from a RR-client)
    10.0.0.2 (metric 2) from 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2)
      Origin IGP, metric 0, localpref 100, valid, internal, multipath, best
      rx pathid: 0x0, tx pathid: 0x0
```

That's totally weird: L3 is advertising the anycast prefix with the original next hop (A3), L2 is advertising two paths to the anycast prefix (toward A1 and A2), but changes the next hop to itself even though *that was not configured*. Changing the BGP next hop behavior bought us nothing.

Here's what's going on:

* L2 has two equal-cost paths to the anycast prefix;
* It tries to do its best, changing the next hop to itself ([more details](https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/08/bgp-next-hop-processing.html#bgp-next-hop-is-not-changed-on-ibgp-sessions)) to make sure it will get the traffic for the anycast prefix and spread it across multiple egress paths;
* Changing the next hop is unnecessary as we've configured *Additional Paths*, but it looks like those two bits of BGP code don't work together in the Cisco IOS release I was running. I retried with IOS XE 16.06 and got the same results.

Next time: fixing the problem the right way with *DMZ Link Bandwidth*.

[^BW]: I have no idea why BGP waits a minute before selecting the best paths after it's started. It drives me mad and I can't find a knob to turn to speed it up.
