After the (in)famous [October 2021 Facebook outage](https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/), Corey Quinn invited me for another [Screaming in the Cloud](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/screaming-in-the-cloud/) chat, this time [focusing on what went wrong](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/screaming-in-the-cloud/ironing-out-the-bgp-ruffles-with-ivan-pepelnjak/) (hint: it wasn't DNS or BGP).

We also touched on VAX/VMS history, how early CCIE lab exams worked, how BGP started, why there are only 13 root name servers ([not really](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/11/dns-anycast.html)), and the transition from networking being pure magic to becoming a commodity. Hope you'll enjoy our chat as much as I did.
