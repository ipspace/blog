Just in case you were recently promoted to be a team leader or a manager: read these somewhat-tongue-in-cheek advices:

*  [How do I feel worthwhile as a manager when my people are doing all the implementing?](https://charity.wtf/2021/01/23/questionable-advice-how-do-i-feel-worthwhile-as-a-manager-when-my-people-are-doing-all-the-implementing/) by [Charity Majors](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy)
*  [The Non-psychopath's Guide to Managing an Open-source Project](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&id=3447645) by [Kode Vicious](https://twitter.com/kode_vicious).

Need more career advice? How about [The Six Year Rule](https://thinkingoutcloud.org/2021/01/27/the-six-year-rule-keeping-your-skills-relevant-in-a-sea-of-technology/) by [Bryan Sullins](https://thinkingoutcloud.org/about-me/)... or you could go and reread my [certifications-related blog posts](https://blog.ipspace.net/tag/certifications.html).
