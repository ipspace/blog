title: OMG, It's Graphs Everywhere
---
One of the subscribers watching the [Graph Algorithms in Networks](https://www.ipspace.net/Graph_Algorithms_in_Networks) webinar found the webinar had an interesting impact on his perspective (according to [his feedback](https://www.ipspace.net/Graph_Algorithms_in_Networks#Happy_Campers)):

> This is genuine content that I haven't seen anywhere else. It helps to get up to speed on computer science topics that are relevant to network professionals. After attending this webinar, I couldn't unsee the graphs anymore that are almost everywhere in networking.

This webinar is now free, as are other webinars by [Rachel Traylor](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Rachel_Traylor), including [*Network Connectivity, Graph Theory, and Reliable Network Design*](https://www.ipspace.net/Network_Connectivity,_Graph_Theory,_and_Reliable_Network_Design) and [*Queuing Theory*](https://www.ipspace.net/Queuing).
