One of the subscribers watching the [Graph Algorithms in Networks](https://www.ipspace.net/Graph_Algorithms_in_Networks) webinar found the webinar had an interesting impact on his perspective (according to [his feedback](https://www.ipspace.net/Graph_Algorithms_in_Networks#Happy_Campers)):

> This is genuine content that I haven't seen anywhere else. It helps to get up to speed on computer science topics that are relevant to network professionals. After attending this webinar, I couldn't unsee the graphs anymore that are almost everywhere in networking.

This webinar is available with [Standard ipSpace.net Subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/) as are other similar webinars by [Rachel Traylor](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Rachel_Traylor) including [Network Connectivity, Graph Theory, and Reliable Network Design](https://www.ipspace.net/Network_Connectivity,_Graph_Theory,_and_Reliable_Network_Design), [Queuing Theory](https://www.ipspace.net/Queuing) and [Reliability Theory: Networking through a Systems Analysis Lens](https://www.ipspace.net/Reliability_Theory:_Networking_through_a_Systems_Analysis_Lens)
