I love the recent [*Internet of Trash*](https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2021-02/iot.html) article by Geoff Huston, in particular this bit:

> “Move fast and break things” is not a tenable paradigm for this industry today, if it ever was. In the light of our experience with the outcomes of an industry that became fixated on pumping out minimally viable product, it's a paradigm that heads towards what we would conventionally label as criminal negligence.

Of course it's not just the Internet-of-Trash. Whole IT is filled with examples of [startups](/2020/02/the-never-ending-my-overlay-is-better.html) and "venerable" companies [doing the same thing](/2019/11/stretched-vlans-and-failing-firewall.html) and [boasting](/2020/02/live-vmotion-into-vmware-on-aws-cloud.html) about their [disruptiveness](/2019/10/the-cost-of-disruptiveness-and.html). Now go and [read the whole article](https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2021-02/iot.html) ;)
