I concluded the _[Focus on Business Challenges First](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetBiz#BF)_ presentation (part of _[Business Aspects of Networking Technologies](https://www.ipspace.net/Business_Aspects_of_Networking_Technologies)_ webinar) with a few technology guidelines starting with:

* Be vendor-agnostic (always look around to see what others are doing);
* Try to understand how the technology you're evaluating works (it will help you spot the potential problems before they crash your network);
* Always select what's best for your business, not for the sales quota of your friendly $vendor account manager.
