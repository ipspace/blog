Johan Gustawsson wrote a lengthy blog post describing [Telia's approach to next-generation Internet backbone architecture](https://blog.arelion.com/2021/04/29/rethinking-internet-backbone-architectures/)... and it's so refreshing seeing someone bringing to life what some of us have been preaching for ages:

* Simplify the network;
* Stop cramming ever-more-complex services into the network;
* Bloated major vendor NPUs implementing every magic ever envisioned are overpriced -- platforms like Broadcom Jericho2 are good enough for most use cases.
* Return from large chassis-based stupidities to network-centric high availability.

I don't know enough about optics to have an opinion on what they did there, but it looks as good as the routing part. It would be great to hear your opinion on the topic -- write a comment.
