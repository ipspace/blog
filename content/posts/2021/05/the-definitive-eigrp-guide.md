Seventeen years after I started working on my [EIGRP book](https://www.amazon.com/EIGRP-Network-Design-Solutions-Definitive/dp/1578701651), the reverse engineering days were over: [RFC 7868](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7868) is _the_ definitive guide to modern EIGRP (I'm not familiar with at least half of the concepts mentioned in it).

Just in case you're interested in a bit of historical trivia: 

* My EIGRP deciphering history started a few years before the book was published. In mid-1990s I was asked (as an external trainer) to create an EIGRP course for Cisco EMEA Training.
* I've never seen any internal EIGRP documentation or code -- everything I knew about EIGRP I've learned from trying out crazy stuff and deciphering debugging messages.
* Two of the RFC authors (Russ White and Don Slice) were the technical reviewers for my EIGRP book. Russ copiously rewrote my pidgin English into something understandable -- if you like reading my blog posts today, you should (also) thank Russ.
