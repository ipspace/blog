Ever since [draft-lapukhov](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-lapukhov-bgp-routing-large-dc-00) was first published almost a decade ago, we all knew BGP was the only routing protocol suitable for data center networking... or at least Thought Leaders and vendor marketers seem to be of that persuasion.

Russ White[^1] argued[^2] that's not the case, dived deep into what the true requirements are, and showed how link-state protocols do a better job if only we fix the flooding behavior[^3].

In the meantime, while many hyperscalers moved beyond BGP-as-the-only-tool mantra, all major data center switching vendors keep promoting [EBGP-over-EBGP or IBGP-over-EBGP EVPN designs](https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/11/the-evpn-dilemma.html), proving yet again how the whole networking industry behaves like fashion designers on a lemming run chasing the latest fad.

## Revision History

2021-05-25
: Reworded the snarky footnote because (A) it wasn't exactly obvious who I had in mind and (B) because Trish vociferously insisted on making it gender-neutral. 

: This is the last change to the blog post, and I won't reply to the comments any longer -- I have better things to do in my life.

[^1]: Contrary to the ladies and gentlemen (most of them belonging to the above-mentioned groups) who vocally opine that "_BGP is the answer_" without even understanding what the question was, Russ has real-life design and operations experience.

[^2]: In 2018 when he was still at LinkedIn and developing OpenFabric, so he might have been a bit biased.

[^3]: Warning: Google will try its very best to track you if you decide to watch Russ' presentation.
