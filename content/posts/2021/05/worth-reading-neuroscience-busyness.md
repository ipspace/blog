In the [Neuroscience of Busyness](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/05/06/the-neuroscience-of-busyness/) article, Cal Newport describes an interesting phenomenon: when solving problems, we tend to *add* components instead of *removing*  them. 

If that doesn't describe a typical network (or protocol) design, I don't know what does. At least now we have a scientific basis to justify our behavior ;)
