Here's one of the major differences between Facebook and Google: one of them publishes research papers with helpful and actionable information, the other uses [publications as recruitment drive](https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/03/before-commenting-on-someone-mentioning.html) full of *[we're so awesome](https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/05/openflow-google-brilliant-but-not.html) but you have to trust us -- we're not sharing the crucial details*.

Recent data point: Facebook published an [interesting paper](https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Running-BGP-in-Data-Centers-at-Scale_final.pdf) describing their [data center BGP design](https://engineering.fb.com/2021/05/13/data-center-engineering/bgp/). Absolutely worth reading.

Just in case you haven't realized: Petr Lapukhov of the [RFC 7938](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7938) fame moved from Microsoft to Facebook a few years ago. Coincidence? I think not.
