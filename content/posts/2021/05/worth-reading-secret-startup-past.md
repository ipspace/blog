If you ever get a feeling the grass is greener on the other (startup) side, read [*My Secret Startup Past*](https://stackingthebricks.com/my-secret-startup-past/) by Amy Hoy, and if you think about starting your business, read [all the other stuff she wrote](https://stackingthebricks.com/). I wish I knew of her when I was starting ipSpace.net a decade ago.
