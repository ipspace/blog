{{<note warn>}}Looks like John changed the name of the project and all the URLs. Will update the links once he's done with the migration.{{</note>}}

John Capobianco recently released his [Magic Carpet](https://github.com/automateyournetwork/magic_carpet): a tool that helps you gather information from network devices without the usual Ansible bloat and glacial speed.

Believing in "_no job is finished until the paperwork is done_", he wrote extensive documentation, and recorded [a collection of videos](https://www.automateyournetwork.ca/magic-carpet/a-collection-of-magic-carpet-videos) describing the tool's functionality -- definitely worth reading, watching, and exploring.
