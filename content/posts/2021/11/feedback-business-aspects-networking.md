Every other blue moon someone asks me to do a not-so-technical presentation at an event, and being a firm believer in frugality I turn most of them into live webinar sessions collected under the *[Business Aspects of Networking](https://www.ipspace.net/Business_Aspects_of_Networking_Technologies)* umbrella.

> You will NEVER see this kind of material in traditional training since it is usually hidden from engineers. This is a great asset to understand and improve how to take technical decisions from a business perspective. That will change how your peers and managers perceive you. It is a great compilation based on real field experience of the non-technical aspects of networking but focused on the business it supports, which is, in turn, the main reason for the network to exist. 

Parts of that webinar are already available with [Free ipSpace.net subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free). You need [Standard or Expert ipSpace.net Subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual) to watch the whole webinar or attend the live sessions.
