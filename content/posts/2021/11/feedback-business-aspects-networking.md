Every other blue moon someone asks me to do a not-so-technical presentation at an event, and being a firm believer in frugality I turn most of them into live webinar sessions collected under the *[Business Aspects of Networking](https://www.ipspace.net/Business_Aspects_of_Networking_Technologies)* umbrella.

> You will NEVER see this kind of material in traditional training since it is usually hidden from engineers. This is a great asset to understand and improve how to take technical decisions from a business perspective. That will change how your peers and managers perceive you.

Parts of that webinar are already available with [Free ipSpace.net subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free). You need [Standard or Expert ipSpace.net Subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual) to watch the whole webinar or attend the live sessions.
