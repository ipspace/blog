title: Mikrotik RouterOS and VyOS Added to netsim-tools
---
[Stefano Sasso](http://stefano.dscnet.org/about/) took my "_Don't complain, submit a PR_" advice seriously and did a wonderful job adding support for Mikrotik RouterOS and VyOS to *netsim-tools*, increasing the number of [supported platforms](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/platforms.html) to twelve. His additions are available in release 1.0.2 which also includes:

* [Automatic creation of groups based on BGP AS numbers](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/groups.html#automatic-bgp-groups)
* [Group-wide node attributes](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/groups.html#setting-node-data-in-groups)
* [Experimental support for Python plugins](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html)
