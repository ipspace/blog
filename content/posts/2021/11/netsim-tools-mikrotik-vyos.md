title: Mikrotik RouterOS and VyOS Added to netsim-tools
---
[Stefano Sasso](http://stefano.dscnet.org/about/) took my "_Don't complain, submit a PR_" advice seriously and did a wonderful job adding support for Mikrotik RouterOS and VyOS to *netsim-tools*, increasing the number of [supported platforms](https://netlab.tools/platforms/) to twelve. His additions are available in release 1.0.2 which also includes:

* [Automatic creation of groups based on BGP AS numbers](https://netlab.tools/groups/#automatic-bgp-groups)
* [Group-wide node attributes](https://netlab.tools/groups/#setting-node-data-in-groups)
* [Experimental support for Python plugins](https://netlab.tools/plugins/)

Interested? Start with [tutorials](https://netlab.tools/tutorials/) and [installation guide](https://netlab.tools/install/) which includes [lab building instructions](https://netlab.tools/install/#creating-the-lab-environment).
