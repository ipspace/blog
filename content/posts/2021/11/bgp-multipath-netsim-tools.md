I was editing the *[BGP Multipathing](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/AR4.3%20-%20BGP%20Multipath%20Basics.mp4?download=yes)* video in the *[Advanced Routing Protocols](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Net101#ADV_ROUTING)* section of *[How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work)* webinar, got to the diagram I used to explain the intricacies of IBGP multipathing and said to myself "*that should be easy (and fun) to set up with netlab*".

Fifteen minutes later[^1d] I had the lab up and running and could verify that BGP works exactly the way I explained it in the webinar.

## Set Up the Environment

I decided to run my tests with container version of Arista EOS (cEOS) on a Ubuntu server. To replicate the labs you'll have to:

* [Set up a Linux server or virtual machine](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#creating-the-lab-environment). If you don't have a preferred distribution, use Ubuntu.
* [Install Docker and containerlab](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/labs/clab.html) (**[netlab install containerlab](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/netlab/install.html)** is the easiest way to do it on Ubuntu).
* [Download and install Arista cEOS image](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/labs/clab.html#container-images).

## Create Topology File

The mandatory first step when using *netlab* to create your virtual lab: create a [YAML file describing the lab topology](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/blob/master/BGP/Multipath/baseline.yml).

I used *containerlab* provider with *eos* devices, and placed most of my routers in AS 65000. External router (Y) would be in AS 65100. The network runs OSPF as the internal routing protocol, and a combination of IBGP and EBGP.

```
provider: clab
module: [ bgp, ospf ]
defaults.device: eos
bgp.as: 65000
```

{{<note>}}I hate the way you have to describe nested dictionaries in YAML, so I added a bit of code to post-YAML parsing that turns dotted notation into a hierarchy of dictionaries{{</note>}}

There will be six nodes in the network -- edge routers A through D, a route reflector, and an external router (Y). I had to set **bgp.rr** attribute on the route reflector, and I decided to use a static ID for that node so I'll be able to quickly identify it in the printouts.

```
nodes:
  a:
  b:
  c:
  d:
  rr:
    bgp.rr: True
    id: 1
```

The external router is in a different autonomous system and needs to originate a BGP prefix:

```
  y:
    bgp.as: 65100
    bgp.originate: [ 10.42.42.0/24 ]
```

As an aside: here's the corresponding data structure in pure YAML to illustrate what's going on behind the scenes:

```
  y:
    bgp:
      as: 65100
      originate: [ 10.42.42.0/24 ]
```
 
 Finally, we need the links connecting the routers. Here they are:
 
```
 links: [ a-b, a-c, b-d, c-d, b-rr, d-rr, c-y, d-y ]
```

## Validating the Topology

I used the *netlab* graphing capabilities together with *graphviz* to generate a diagram of the "physical" topology and BGP sessions. The diagrams were created with *graphviz* which has its own ideas how to place stuff. Their algorithms usually work well; for whatever reason my network diagrams always look messy.

{{<figure src="/2021/11/BGP-multipath-sess.png" caption="BGP sessions -- created with **netlab create -o graph:bgp && dot graph.dot -T png -o topo.png**">}}

## The Smoke Test

Deploying a virtual lab is a one-liner: all it takes is **netlab up baseline.yml** (that's how I named my topology file) and you get a configured lab a minute or two later[^NX].

[^NX]: Or a lunch break later if you decide to test a large topology built with Nexus 9000v.

I had to wait a few more minutes for BGP to start and announce the configured prefixes. After that, I used **netlab connect a** to connect to router A, and executed a few commands.

Let's look at the loopback addresses first (so you'll understand the **show** printouts):

```
a#show hosts

Default domain is not configured
Name/address lookup uses domain service
Name servers are:
IP Address VRF Priority
---------- --- --------

Static Mappings:
Hostname IP   Addresses
-------- ---- ---------
b        IPV4 10.0.0.3
              10.1.0.9
              10.1.0.2
              10.1.0.17
c        IPV4 10.1.0.13
              10.1.0.25
              10.1.0.6
              10.0.0.4
d        IPV4 10.0.0.5
              10.1.0.14
              10.1.0.21
              10.1.0.29
              10.1.0.10
rr       IPV4 10.1.0.22
              10.1.0.18
              10.0.0.1
y        IPV4 10.1.0.26
              10.0.0.6
              10.1.0.30
```

Now for the real test: the route toward 10.42.42.0/24.

```
a#show ip bgp 10.42.42.0
BGP routing table information for VRF default
Router identifier 10.0.0.2, local AS number 65000
BGP routing table entry for 10.42.42.0/24
 Paths: 1 available
  65100
    10.0.0.5 from 10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1)
      Origin INCOMPLETE, metric 0, localpref 100, IGP metric 30, weight 0, tag 0
      Received 00:00:57 ago, valid, internal, best
      Originator: 10.0.0.5, Cluster list: 10.0.0.1
      Rx SAFI: Unicast
```

As expected, the route is coming from the route reflector (10.0.0.1) and the next hop is 10.0.0.5 (D), even though it would be better for A to use C as the next hop.

### Revenge of the IGP

How about a simple brain-teaser? This is the **traceroute** printout from A to Y (taken from the IOS version of the lab, see below):

```
a#trace y source loop 0 probe 5
Type escape sequence to abort.
Tracing the route to y (10.0.0.6)
VRF info: (vrf in name/id, vrf out name/id)
  1 b (10.1.0.2) 2 msec
    c (10.1.0.6) 2 msec
    b (10.1.0.2) 3 msec
    c (10.1.0.6) 3 msec
    b (10.1.0.2) 3 msec
  2 y (10.1.0.26) 4 msec
    d (10.1.0.10) 4 msec *  5 msec
    y (10.1.0.26) 3 msec
```

As you can see, sometimes the probes reach Y in two hops, and sometimes the second hop happens to be D. What's going on? Write a comment!

## Testing Other Platforms

Another beauty of *netlab* is the ease of changing network devices or virtualization providers. All I had to do to replace Arista EOS with Cisco IOSv was two extra parameters in the **netlab up** command:

```
netlab up baseline.yml --device iosv --provider libvirt
```

A few minutes later, I had an identically configured lab, this time running Cisco IOS. I could have repeated the same tests on [over a dozen devices supported by *netlab*](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/platforms.html) (if only I had all the necessary Vagrant boxes installed)

**Coming up next**: fixing suboptimal BGP routing with *additional paths* functionality.

## Off-Topic: Nicer-Looking Graphs

Jeroen van Bemmel suggested using [*graphviz* **rankdir** parameter](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/docs/attrs/rankdir/) to generate better-looking graphs. As you can set individual graph options with CLI parameters, I didn't have to change the .dot files generated with **netlab create**. All I had to do was to add an extra parameter to the **dot** command:

```
dot -Grankdir=LR -T png -o graph.png graph.dot
```

Here are the results:
