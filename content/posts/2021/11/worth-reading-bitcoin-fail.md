### Two Days Later...

As the heading says, I added this section two days after the blog post was published. I should have [expected things to be more complex than they look](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/07/17/solution/), and some of the comments definitely gave me much to think about and/or research.

Thanks a million to everyone who took their time to write a thoughtful comment, and for all the useful links you posted.

I also toned down the original blog post a bit ;)
