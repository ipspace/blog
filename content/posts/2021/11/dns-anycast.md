One of the underlying reasons for the [October 2021 Facebook outage](/2021/10/circular-dependencies-considered-harmful.html) was an intricate interaction between BGP routing and their DNS servers needed to support optimal anycast configuration. Not surprisingly, it was all networking engineers' fault according to some opinions[^1]

> ⁦‪There's no need for anycast[^2]/BGP advertisement for DNS servers. DNS is already highly available by design. Only network people never understand that, which leads to overengineering.

It's not that hard to find a counter-argument[^4]: while it looks like there are [only 13 root name servers](https://root-servers.org/), each one of them is a large set of instances advertising the same IP prefix[^3] to the Internet.

[^2]: Advertising the same IP address from multiple locations, or having a set of servers accepting queries and responding from the same IP address.

[^3]: Containing the IP address of the root name server

For example, in October 2021, 118 sites advertise the J name server, some of them locally (to adjacent ISPs), others globally. Furthermore, while there are over 1000 instances of root name servers worldwide, at least [RIPE often implements a K name server instance](https://labs.ripe.net/author/romeo_zwart/new-architecture-model-for-k-root-local-instances/) as a cluster of servers advertising the same IP address to the adjacent routers. *Local nodes* are implemented with two servers (even smaller *hosted nodes* have a single server), while the larger *global nodes* always run on a server farm.

I guess there's no doubt root name servers use anycast. It must be the incompetent networking engineers setting them up like that, right? There might be other reasons -- the *[Evaluating The Effects Of Anycast On DNS Root Nameservers](https://www.ripe.net/publications/docs/ripe-393)* article (HT: @hugoslabbert) lists three goals of root name server anycast:

* Increased resilience
* Higher (improved) performance
* Reliability (deploying root name servers closer to clients).

There's another reason organizations like CloudFlare use anycast: DDoS prevention. If you advertise the same IP prefix from hundreds of locations, it's hard to build a large-enough botnet to bring them all down.

Closer to the DNS clients, many organizations use anycast DNS servers as recursive resolvers. Google's 8.8.8.8 and CloudFlare's 1.1.1.1 are the obvious examples; I'm positive any decent-sized ISP does the same. [@rot26de described a great reason for that](https://twitter.com/rot26de/status/1445850008444624907):

> In the past I anycasted a (small) ISPs Resolvers. Linux ALWAYS waits for a timeout of the first resolver before asking the second[^4]. That can cause loads of false monitoring timeouts of services relying on reverse DNS.

[^4]: Cisco IOS had the same behavior the last time I looked

OK, so we know root name servers use anycast, and many recursive resolvers use it to ensure better performance for suboptimal clients, but surely an authoritative DNS server for a small organization does not need to use anycast?

Of course not. In the past, I had one name server running within the organization, and a secondary one running somewhere else to increase the resilience of name resolution[^5]. 

To be realistic: those days are long gone, I'm too old for that **** and use hosted DNS service... and all hosted solutions I would consider use anycast. It's amazing how influential those damn incompetent over-engineering networking people got in the meantime.

Finally, consider the amount of DNS traffic any member of the FAANG club must be getting (Facebook claims to have 2.9 billion active users). Highly distributed anycast is the only sane way to survive that onslaught.

### Lessons learned

* Anycast DNS is used in most large-scale environments to provide resilience, scalability, improved reliability, and other features like geographic load balancing (for more details, listen to the [podcast I did with NS1 in 2015](https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/04/nsone-data-driven-dns-on-software-gone.html)).
* Your network or DNS traffic is not remotely similar to Facebook's (or root name servers).
* Whatever lessons and experience you might have gained running your environment for ages might not be relevant in dissimilar-enough environments.
* Sometimes people do stuff for good reasons. It might be worth figuring out what their reasoning is even if you disagree with them -- that's how we learn and become better engineers.
