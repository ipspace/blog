In the [previous blog post](/2021/06/single-metric-ucmp-hard/) in this series, I described why it's (almost) impossible to implement unequal-cost multipathing for anycast services (multiple servers advertising the same IP address or range) with OSPF. Now let's see how easy it is to solve the same challenge with [BGP DMZ Link Bandwidth](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-idr-link-bandwidth-07) attribute.

I didn't want to listen to the fan noise generated by my measly Intel NUC when simulating a full leaf-and-spine fabric, so I decided to implement a slightly smaller network:

{{<figure src="/2021/06/BGP-Link-Bandwidth-Lab.png">}}

X1 and X2 are Cisco IOS devices advertising the same prefix -- 10.42.42.0/24. E1 and E2 have the same function as the ToR switches in a leaf-and-spine fabric with a slight twist: every link between AS 65000 and AS 65001 has a different bandwidth. PE1 is an equivalent of a spine switch in a leaf-and-spine fabric.

After we get BGP and OSPF up and running, E1 receives two copies of 10.42.42.0/24 prefix (one from X1 and another one from X2), but it only uses one of them for packet forwarding.

The caveat: default value of BGP **maximum-paths** on Cisco IOS is one. After changing that to eight (because why not), E1 uses both prefixes... but in 1:1 ratio.

Time to enter the [magical world of DMZ Link Bandwidth](/2008/07/unequal-bandwidth-ebgp-load-balancing/). We have to configure:

* **neighbor dmzlink-bw** on all EBGP neighbors to attach *DMZ Link Bandwidth* extended BGP community to all BGP prefixes received from EBGP neighbors[^1].
* **bgp dmzlink-bw** within an address family to use the link bandwidth extended community to calculate traffic shares.

[^1]: As is often the case when configuring BGP, the changes apply to new incoming updates. Do **clear ip bgp soft in** first.

{{<cc>}}BGP configuration changes on E1{{</cc>}}
```
router bgp 65000

  bgp dmzlink-bw
  neighbor 10.1.0.10 dmzlink-bw
  neighbor 10.1.0.14 dmzlink-bw
  maximum-paths 8
```

After configuring DMZ Link Bandwidth on E1 and E2, you'll notice additional communities attached to BGP prefix 10.42.42.0/24... and a modified traffic share on E1 (E2 has only one link into AS 65001).

Now for a sprinkle of *Pure Magic&trade;* -- let's inspect the BGP table and IP routing table on PE1 without doing anything else but configuring **maximum-paths** and **bgp dmzlink-bw** on it:

{{<cc>}}BGP prefix 10.42.42.0/24 on PE1{{</cc>}}
```
pe1#show ip bgp 10.42.42.0
BGP routing table entry for 10.42.42.0/24, version 9
Paths: (2 available, best #1, table default)
Multipath: eBGP iBGP
  Advertised to update-groups:
     1
  Refresh Epoch 1
  65100, (Received from a RR-client)
    10.0.0.1 (metric 2) from 10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1)
      Origin IGP, metric 0, localpref 100, valid, internal, multipath, best
      DMZ-Link Bw 625 kbytes
      rx pathid: 0, tx pathid: 0x0
  Refresh Epoch 3
  65100, (Received from a RR-client)
    10.0.0.2 (metric 2) from 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2)

      DMZ-Link Bw 125 kbytes
      rx pathid: 0, tx pathid: 0
```

The 10.42.42.0/24 prefix received from E2 contains the expected DMZ Link Bandwidth (1000 kbps), while the prefix received from E1 contains the *sum of all DMZ Link Bandwidths in E1 BGP table*, resulting in perfect UCMP traffic ratio. Problem solved.

Unfortunately, there's always another twist in every saga. While the IP routing table entry on PE1 looks great, and the overview part of the CEF table entry looks equally impressive...

... the hashing buckets don't reflect the desired traffic sharing. The traffic is sent toward E1 and E2 in 8:8 (i.e. 1:1) ratio. Bummer.

### Back to Leaf-and-Spine Fabrics

**Can we use the same trick in a leaf-and-spine fabric?** Absolutely. Figuring out how to apply these concepts to leaf-and-spine fabrics is left as an exercise for the reader.

The example used IBGP over OSPF. **Can we use EBGP-only design in a leaf-and-spine fabric?** According to the original DMZ Link Bandwidth draft, the answer is NO. The DMZ Link Bandwidth community is not supposed to be propagated beyond a single AS[^2]. Of course that didn't stop anyone -- there's [another draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-mohanty-bess-ebgp-dmz-03) saying *it's OK to propagate DMZ Link Bandwidth over EBGP*.

I used Cisco IOS XE in the examples. **What about data center switches?** Similar functionality is implemented in Arista EOS and FRR (and thus Cumulus Linux, SoNIC, and whoever else uses FRR). 

The Arista EOS implementation (described in the *[Data Center Fabrics](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DCFabric#ARISTA)* webinars in June 2016) is even better than what's available in Cisco IOS XE. You can aggregate the bandwidth advertised from downstream BGP speakers (servers or leaf switches), and split the bandwidth when advertising the same prefix toward upstream BGP speakers (spine switches or ingress leaf switches).

I haven't found anything similar in Nexus OS; corrections are (as always) most welcome.

[^2]: Long-time readers might remember that I was always telling people to [use IBGP+OSPF](/2018/05/is-ospf-or-is-is-good-enough-for-my/) instead of *EBGP as better IGP* hype in small data center fabrics. [Not that anyone ever listens](/2017/11/bgp-as-better-igp-when-and-where/).
