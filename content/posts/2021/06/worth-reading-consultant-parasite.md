Stumbled upon a must-read article: _[Is Your Consultant a Parasite?](https://ea.rna.nl/2021/06/06/is-your-consultant-a-parasite/)_

For an even more snarky take on the subject, enjoy the _[Ten basic rules for dealing with strategy consultants](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/10/ten-basic-rules-for-dealing-with.html)_ by Simon Wardley.
