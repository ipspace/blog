In the previous video in the _[Switching, Routing and Bridging](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Net101#SWITCH)_ section of _[How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/Net101)_ webinar we [compared transparent bridging with IP routing](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/06/video-routing-bridging.html). Not surprisingly (given my well-known bias toward stable solutions) I recommended using IP routing as much as possible, but there are still people out there pushing large-scale transparent bridging solutions. 

In [today's video](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/BR3%20-%20Typical%20Large-Scale%20Bridging%20Use%20Cases.mp4?doccode=Net101) we'll look at some of the supposed use cases and stable solutions you could use instead of stretching a virtual thick yellow cable halfway across a continent.
