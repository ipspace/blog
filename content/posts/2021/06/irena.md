In February 2018, [Irena Marčetič](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irenamarcetic/) joined ipSpace.net to fix the (lack of) marketing. After getting that done, she quickly took over most of sales, support, logistics, content production, guest speaker coordination... If you needed anything from us in the last few years, it was probably Irena answering your requests and helping you out.

She did a fantastic job and transformed ipSpace.net from _Ivan and an occasional guest speaker_ to a finely tuned machine producing several hours of new content every month. She organized our courses, worked with guest speakers, podcast guests and hosts, participated in every guest speaker webinar to take notes for the editing process, managed content editing, watched every single video we created before it was published to make sure the audio was of acceptable quality and all the bloopers were removed... while answering crazy emails like _I need you to fill in this Excel spreadsheet with your company data because I cannot copy-paste that information from your web site myself_ and solving whatever challenges our customers faced.

Unfortunately, [Irena decided to go back to pure marketing](/2021/01/planning-coffee-break.html) and is leaving ipSpace.net today. Thanks a million for all the great work -- we'll badly miss you.
