When I started developing [AWS-](https://www.ipspace.net/Amazon_Web_Services_Networking) and [Azure Networking](https://www.ipspace.net/Microsoft_Azure_Networking) webinars, I wondered whether they would make sense -- after all, you can easily find tons of training offerings focused on public cloud services.

However, it looks like most of those materials focus on developers (no wonder -- they are the most significant audience), with little thought being given to the needs of network engineers... at least according to the [feedback left by one of ipSpace.net subscribers](https://www.ipspace.net/Microsoft_Azure_Networking#Happy_Campers).

I have been searching online for months for any training content that go deep dive in Azure networking as we are moving to Azure currently in my company, but I didnâ€™t find any content that explains in details the technical architectures, and all ins- and outs about Azure networking. I am so delighted that I have subscribed to ipspace.net. Keep up the good work.
