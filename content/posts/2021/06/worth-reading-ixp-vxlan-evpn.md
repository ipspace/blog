title: 'Worth Reading: Switching to IP fabrics'

Namex, an Italian IXP, decided to replace their existing peering fabric with a fully automated leaf-and-spine fabric using VXLAN and EVPN running on Cumulus Linux.

They documented the design, deployment process, and automation scripts they developed in an 
[extensive blog post](https://blog.namex.it/2021/04/switching-to-ip-fabrics/) that's well worth reading. Enjoy ;)
