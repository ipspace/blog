title: Unnumbered Ethernet Interfaces, DHCP Edition
---
Last week we explored the [basics of unnumbered IPv4 Ethernet interfaces](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/06/unnumbered-ethernet-interfaces.html), and how you could use them to save IPv4 address space in routed access networks. I also mentioned that you could simplify the head-end router configuration if you're using DHCP instead of per-host static routes.

Obviously you'd need a smart DHCP server/relay implementation to make this work. Simplistic local DHCP server would allocate an IP address to a client requesting one, send a response and move on. Likewise, a DHCP relay would forward a DHCP request to a remote DHCP server (adding enough information to allow the DHCP server to select the desired DHCP pool) and forward its response to the client.
<!--more-->
What we need to make unnumbered IPv4 Ethernet interfaces work with DHCP is an extra step: as a DHCP reply (locally originated or relayed) is sent to a client connected over an unnumbered IPv4 interface, a static host route is added to the router's routing table to make that client reachable through the router.

I've first seen static routes created from DHCP responses in [DHCPv6 relays supporting IPv6 prefix delegation with IA_PD option](https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/10/dhcpv6-relaying-another-trouble-spot.html). A few years later, DHCPv6 relays started [adding host routes based on IA_NA (address allocation) responses](https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/01/dhcpv6-based-address-allocation-on.html). Similar behavior is now available in some IPv4 DHCP implementations[^3].

[^3]: At least in IOS XE release 16.6, pointers to other implementations are most welcome -- please write a comment.

## Does It Really Work?

A lab test always beats academic discussions, and we already have the lab built. [We'll use the same lab setup as the last time](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/tree/master/routing/lan-unnumbered) with a slightly different IP addressing. Instead of static IP addresses and static routes, we'll configure DHCP server on the access router, and use DHCP-based address allocation on the clients.

{{<figure src="/2021/06/Addr-Ethernet-Unnumbered-DHCP.png" caption="Lab topology">}}

To make our setup work we have to configure DHCP client on *c1* and *c2*. I used Cisco IOS XE for the clients; I could have used Linux VMs or containers, but then I'd have to figure out how to configure DHCP client on a Linux box. Call me lazy...

{{<cc>}}DHCP client configured on clients' uplink{{</cc>}}
```
interface GigabitEthernet2
 description c1 -> rtr [dhcp]
 ip address dhcp
```

On the access router we have to configure:

* A DHCP pool;
* A loopback interface with an IP prefix exactly matching the DHCP pool IP prefix;
* Unnumbered access interfaces.

{{<cc>}}DHCP server configuration on *rtr*{{</cc>}}
```
interface Loopback1
 ip address 10.42.42.1 255.255.255.0
!
ip dhcp pool Access
 network 10.42.42.1 255.255.255.0
 default-router 10.42.42.1
!
interface GigabitEthernet2
 no ip address
 ip unnumbered Loopback1
interface GigabitEthernet3
 no ip address
 ip unnumbered Loopback1
```

After a few seconds, we'll see the DHCP bindings[^1]:

[^1]: I removed the *type* and *state* columns from the printout   to squeeze it into available width.

{{<cc>}}DHCP bindings on *rtr*{{</cc>}}
```
rtr#show ip dhcp binding
Bindings from all pools not associated with VRF:
IP address      Client-ID/ 		Lease expiration 	Interface
		Hardware address/
		User name
10.42.42.2      0063.6973.636f.2d35.    Jun 07 2021 07:27 AM    GigabitEthernet3
                3235.342e.3030.3438.
                2e32.6462.362d.4769.
                32
10.42.42.3      0063.6973.636f.2d35.    Jun 07 2021 07:27 AM    GigabitEthernet2
                3235.342e.3030.6333.
                2e61.3066.382d.4769.
                32
```

At the same time, the static host routes pointing to allocated DHCP addresses are added to the IP routing table:

{{<cc>}}IP routing table on *rtr*{{</cc>}}
```
rtr#show ip route 10.42.42.0 longer-prefixes | begin Gateway
Gateway of last resort is 192.168.121.1 to network 0.0.0.0

      10.0.0.0/8 is variably subnetted, 5 subnets, 2 masks
C        10.0.0.3/32 is directly connected, Loopback0
C        10.42.42.0/24 is directly connected, Loopback1
L        10.42.42.1/32 is directly connected, Loopback1
S        10.42.42.2/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet3
S        10.42.42.3/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet2
```

From [last week's blog post](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/06/unnumbered-ethernet-interfaces.html) we know that's enough to make the IP routing work -- we can ping *c2* (10.42.42.2) and the other loopback interface of *rtr* (10.0.0.3) from *c1*.

{{<cc>}}Connectivity tests on *c1*{{</cc>}}
```
c1#ping 10.42.42.2
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.42.42.2, timeout is 2 seconds:
..!!!
Success rate is 60 percent (3/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/1/2 ms
c1#ping 10.0.0.1
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.0.0.1, timeout is 2 seconds:
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/1/1 ms
```

## Repeatability Matters

Want to check my lab results? The final router configurations are on GitHub.

Want to build a lab in a few minutes and have it configured in seconds? You'll have to invest a bit of time first:

* Install [Vagrant and libvirt](https://netlab.tools/labs/libvirt/). If you're running your lab on Windows or MacOS host, [use a Ubuntu virtual machine](https://blog.kirchne.red/netsim-tools-quickstart.html).
* [Build CSR 1000v box](https://codingpackets.com/blog/cisco-iosv-vagrant-libvirt-box-install/)
* [Install *netlab*](https://netlab.tools/install/)

After you got everything up and running:

* Copy my [lab topology](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/blob/master/routing/lan-unnumbered/dhcp.yml) into **dhcp.yml** in an empty directory (or clone my [netlab-examples repository](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples))
* Execute **netlab create dhcp.yml** to create Vagrantfile, Ansible inventory and Ansible configuration file
* Execute **vagrant up** to start the lab
* Execute **netlab initial** to configure the devices.

You could apply the configuration changes outlined in this blog post manually. I decided to automate them:

* Add [client-side](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/blob/master/routing/lan-unnumbered/dhcp-client.j2) and [server-side](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/blob/master/routing/lan-unnumbered/dhcp-server.j2) Jinja2 templates to your directory
* Execute **netlab config dhcp-server.j2 -l rtr**[^2] to configure the DHCP server
* Execute **netlab config dhcp-client.j2 -l c1,c2** to configure DHCP clients
* Use **netlab connect** to connect to the routers and inspect the results.

[^2]: **netlab config** command invokes an Ansible playbook and accepts the usual **ansible-playbook** parameters. The **-l** parameter limits the playbook run to a subset of devices.
