A while ago we discussed whether [unequal-cost multipathing (UCMP) makes sense](/2021/02/does-ucmp-make-sense.html) (TL&DR: rarely), and whether we could implement it in [link-state routing protocols](/2021/03/ucmp-link-state-protocols.html) (TL&DR: yes). Even though we could modify OSPF or IS-IS to support UCMP, and Cisco IOS XR even implemented those changes ([they are not exactly widely used](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/03/ucmp-link-state-protocols.html#496)), the results are... suboptimal.

Imagine a simple network with four nodes, three equal-bandwidth links, and a link that has half the bandwidth of the other three:

It obviously makes sense to spread the load between E1 and E2 in 2:1 ratio (â…” of the traffic going over C2 and â…“ of the traffic going over C1). That's not what you'd get if you add the link costs together. The cost of E1-C1-E2 is 30, the cost of E1-C2-E2 is 20, and thus the load balancing ratio will be 2:3 (or something similar).

There's absolutely no way that you would get the load balancing ratios right in a single-metric routing protocol without getting insane trying to tweak the link metrics. You _could_ get the metrics just right with some interesting math, or using a tool like Cariden MATE, or using MPLS-TE tunnels (where the load balancing ratio is determined by relative tunnel bandwidth)... but it's not trivial.

How about the data center anycast use case I [mentioned the last time](/2021/06/tcp-anycast-hard.html)?

What we'd like to have is 75% of the traffic going from L4 toward L1 (where it's spread between A,B, and C) and 25% of the traffic going toward L2. 

A simplistic approach could assign humongous costs to the server links (so that the intra-fabric cost would be negligible compared to the total cost), but you'd still be stuck with 50:50 ratio between L1 and L2 -- no implementation of a link-state protocol I've seen so far is reducing the link cost based on availability of parallel links. S1 would see 10.42.0.1/32 prefix being available through L1 with exactly the same cost as through L2.

Yet again, you could tweak the metrics, and change them automatically every time you add or remove a server (congratulations, you implemented self-driving software-defined network), but I wish you luck trying to troubleshoot that Rube Goldberg invention.

The only way to make anycast UCMP work well is to realize the problem has two components:

* **Network topology component** -- find the end-to-end paths from ingress to egress devices
* **Endpoint reachability component** -- find how many endpoints are connected to every egress device and change load balancing rations accordingly.

Do we have a set of routing protocols that could do all that? Of course; one of them is called BGP ðŸ˜‰... and in the next blog post in this series we'll use BGP to solve the problem.
