In January 2018 [Rodney Brooks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodney-brooks-1a137517/) made a [series of long-term predictions](https://rodneybrooks.com/my-dated-predictions/) about self-driving cars, robotics, AI, ML, and space travel. Not surprisingly, his predictions were curmudgeonly and pessimistic when compared to the daily hype (or I wouldn't be blogging about it)... but guess who was right ;) 

He's also the only predictor I'm aware of who is not afraid to compare what he wrote with how reality turned out years down the line. On January 1st he [published the 2021 edition of the predictions scorecard](http://rodneybrooks.com/predictions-scorecard-2021-january-01/) and so far he hasn't been too pessimistic yet. Keep that in mind the next time you'll be listening to your favorite $vendor droning about the wonders of AI/ML.
