After [discussing the technology options one has when trying to get a packet across the network](https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/11/video-getting-packet-across-network.html), we dived deep into two interesting topics:

* How do you combine packet forwarding at multiple layers of OSI stack (multi-layer switching)?
* What happens when you do layer-N forwarding over layer-M transport core where N <= M (example: IPv6 packets over IPv4 packets) aka tunneling?

You'll find more details (including other hybrids like Loose Source Routing) in *[Multi-Layer Switching and Tunneling](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/SW3%20-%20Multi-Layer%20Switching%20and%20Tunneling.mp4?doccode=Net101)* video.
