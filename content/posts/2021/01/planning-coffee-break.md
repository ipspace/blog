title: Planning the Next Extended Coffee Break
---
**Long story short**: ipSpace.net is ~~going on an extended coffee break on June 24th 2021~~ [reducing the scope of activities](/2021/04/coffee-break-take-two.html) on July 1st 2021. You can stop reading; the rest of the blog post is full of details you probably don't care about.

**What exactly does that mean?** Since this blog post was published in January 2021, we pretty much [figured out a way forward](https://www.ipspace.net/Break/Overview), and I'm glad we let engineers considering our subscriptions know months in advance what might happen.

Anyway, after investing [two lifetimes](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2012-09-02) into this project, and a few planned changes coming just before our regular summer hiatus (see below) it's time for ~~a longer break~~ an adjustment. ipSpace.net will revert back to Ivan working on some interesting stuff.
<!--more-->
**What planned changes are you talking about?** Three years ago [Irena Marčetič](https://www.ipspace.net/Team:Irena_Marcetic) joined ipSpace.net (making us a *team* for the first time). She quickly took over day-to-day operations, making it possible for me to focus on creating things I hope you found valuable instead of dealing with support issues, video editing, guest speaker logistics, and a dozen other boring things that need to be do to keep a business running. 

The split of responsibilities also allowed us to create significantly more content, have more guest speakers, and run several online courses each year.

Irena was pretty open when she joined ipSpace.net that she might move on in a few years... and decided it's time to move on by the end of June 2021, giving me a perfect excuse to take a break myself.

**What will happen to ipSpace.net content?** Nothing bad. Everything that's out there will stay where it is, and we plan to [keep going at full speed until late June 2021](/2021/01/planning-webinars-2021.html). 

The rate of content delivery will slow down after that. Expect one or two live sessions per month (excluding July, August and December), mostly without guest speakers.

**What will happen to standard ipSpace subscriptions?** As long as I'm not publishing new content I'll keep extending all active subscriptions. I'll also make sure that anyone buying new subscription or renewing their subscription before February 1st 2021 gets the value for their money. [More details](https://www.ipspace.net/Break/Overview#Changes_to_ipSpace.net_Standard_Subscriptions)...

However, you might decide not to renew your subscription if it expires in the following months.

On a totally unrelated topic, it's [almost exactly 10 years since I launched the ipSpace.net subscription](/2010/12/yearly-subscription-to-my-webinars.html).

**What will happen to online courses?** There will be no change for existing course attendees. I will keep supporting you in your studies and review hands-on assignments... but it might take a bit longer than usual.

**What will happen to Expert ipSpace.net subscriptions?** Contrary to the early ideas, we're not planning any major changes for Expert Subscriptions. As long as you'll be able to buy them, you'll get the promised 12 months of help-and-support.

**What will happen to ipSpace.net blog?** How long do you think I'd be able to keep quiet? Of course I'll keep ranting, and there are thousands of old blog posts that need to be cleaned up and refreshed.

**What will happen to Software Gone Wild podcast?** [Nick Buraglio](https://www.ipspace.net/Expert:Nick_Buraglio) decided to [start his own podcast](https://forwardingplane.net/2021/01/21/modemcast-podcast/), so we wrapped up Software Gone Wild.  The last episode was published in April 2021.

We've probably missed numerous details when preparing this wall of text. Please let us know what we've missed in the comments.
