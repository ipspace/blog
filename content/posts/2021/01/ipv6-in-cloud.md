In December 2020 Ed Horley [invited me to a chat](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/ipv6-buzz-067-ipv6-in-the-cloud-with-ivan-pepeinjak/) about IPv6 in the public cloud. While I usually don't want to think about a protocol that's old enough to buy its own beer in US, we nonetheless had interesting discussions (including the need for frequent RA messages in AWS VPC).

{{<note warn>}}I also proved [Clarke's first law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws). Running IPv6 over IPv4 IPsec tunnel is a perfectly legal combo.{{</note>}}
