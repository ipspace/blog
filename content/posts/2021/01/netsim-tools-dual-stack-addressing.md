title: 'Build Virtual Lab Topology: Dual Stack Addressing, ArcOS  and Junos Support'
---
In mid-December I [announced a set of tools](https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/12/build-labs-netsim-tools.html) that will help you build Vagrant-based remote labs much faster than writing Vagrantfiles and Ansible inventories by hand.

In early January I received a nice surprise: [Dave Thelen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-thelen-10261312/) not only decided to use the tool, he submitted a pull request with full-blown (and correctly implemented) ArcOS support. A few days later I managed to figure out what needs to be configured on vSRX to make it work, added Junos support, and thus increased the [number of supported platforms](https://netlab.tools/platforms/) to six (spanning five different operating systems).

{{<note info>}}In the meantime, the *netsim-tools* project grew beyond my wildest dreams, we renamed it to *netlab*, and were forced to dropped ArcOS support.{{</note>}}

I always felt that the initial approach to lab addressing was a dirty hack that would have to be fixed in the future... and that future arrived on January 12th when I released a totally refactored address allocation code supporting multiple address pools and IPv6. Now you can build IPv4-only labs, IPv6-only labs, or dual-stack labs (with each link using one or both protocols).

Dave's enthusiasm ("_I'm using the tool daily_") also prompted me to document most of what's available including a [lab topology tutorial](https://netlab.tools/tutorials/) and a full-blown description of how you define [nodes (network devices)](https://netlab.tools/nodes/), [links](https://netlab.tools/links/), and [address pools](https://netlab.tools/addressing/).

You can [install **netlab** as a Python3 package](https://netlab.tools/install/) ([read the documentation](https://netlab.tools/)). If you want to contribute to the project or customize it to your needs, clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab).
