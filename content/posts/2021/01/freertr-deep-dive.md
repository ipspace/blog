_This podcast introduction was written by [Nick Buraglio](https://www.ipspace.net/Expert:Nick_Buraglio), the host of today's podcast._

In today's evolving landscape of whitebox, brightbox, and software routing, a small but incredibly comprehensive routing platform called [FreeRTR](http://freerouter.nop.hu/) has quietly been [evolving](https://connect.geant.org/2020/01/17/rare-project-bringing-back-the-network-innovation-within-research-and-education-community) out of a research and education service provider network in Hungary. 

[Kevin Myers](https://www.stubarea51.net/about-me/) of [IPArchitechs](https://www.iparchitechs.com/) brought this to my attention around [March of 2019](https://forwardingplane.net/2019/03/02/freertr-as-a-lab-environment/), at which point I went [straight to work with it](https://github.com/buraglio/SRv6-Net) to see how far it could be pushed.

I will fully admit that my expectations were low, however, the incredibly rich list of protocol support was too much to be ignored. Boasting protocols such as RSVP-TE, SR, SR-TE, BIER, SRv6 -- the list goes on -- it was impossible to ignore. So, after almost 7 months of bartering for scheduling, I was finally able to pin down the author [Csaba Mate](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mc36mc36/) for a one-on-one chat about the history, the motivations, and what lies ahead for this impressively strong open source routing platform.
