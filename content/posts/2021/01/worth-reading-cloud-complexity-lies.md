Anyone who spent some time reading cloud providers' documentation instead of watching slide decks or vendor keynotes knows that setting up infrastructure in a public cloud is not much simpler than doing it on-premises. You will outsource hardware management (installations, upgrades, replacements...) and might deal with an orchestration system provisioning services instead of configuring individual devices, but you still have to make the same decisions, and take the same set of responsibilities.

Obviously that doesn't look good in a vendor slide deck, so don't expect them to tell you the gory details (and when they start talking about *the power of declarative API* you know you have a winner)... but every now and then someone decides to point out the state of emperor's clothes, this time Gerben Wierda in his [*The many lies about reducing complexity part 2: Cloud*](https://ea.rna.nl/2021/01/10/the-many-lies-about-reducing-complexity-part-2-cloud/).
