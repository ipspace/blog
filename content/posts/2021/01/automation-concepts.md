There's one more thing I feel needs to be done before I go for that [coffee break](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/01/planning-coffee-break.html): a webinar focusing on [network automation concepts](https://www.ipspace.net/Network_Automation_Concepts) (as opposed to *[replacing Excel with YAML and Ansible](https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/05/looking-for-tool-to-create-device.html)* or *[Becoming a Python Coder](https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/11/growing-beyond-networking-skills.html)*). Here's a rough list of concepts I think should be in there:

* Data models and data stores
* Data model transformations
* Single source of truth
* Abstraction layers
* Idempotency
<!--more-->
On the processes side I'll cover:

* Infrastructure-as-code (IaC)
* GitOps
* Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD)
* Orchestration systems and APIs

And just for the giggles I'll share my opinion on these "revolutionary" concepts:

* Intent-based networking
* Imperative and declarative APIs

The slide deck for *[Data Models and Data Stores](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=AutConcepts#DATAMODELS)* section is already online, the first live session will take place in early February 2021.

I've probably missed something important -- please write a comment.
