A junior networking engineer asked me for a list of recommended entry-level networking blogs. I have no idea (I haven't been in that position for ages); the best I can do is to share my [list of networking-related RSS feeds](/2021/04/networking.opml) and the process I'm using to collect interesting blogs:

### Infrastructure

* RSS is your friend. Find a decent RSS reader. I'm using Feedly  -- natively in a web browser and with various front-ends on my tablet and phone (note to Google: we haven't forgotten you killed Reader because you weren't making enough money with it).
* If a blog doesn't have an RSS feed I'm not interested.

### Growing Your List

* Find a few blogs that publish "worth reading" lists to get you started.
* Whenever you stumble upon an interesting new blog, explore a bit, and if you find it interesting, add it to your RSS reader. You can always drop it later.
* Do the same thing whenever you're googling around and find an interesting source of information.
* Follow links in blog posts you read. Sometimes they point to other blogs. See above.

In the end, you'll have a list of dozens RSS sources tailored to your interests. Don't worry about missing something really interesting. Whatever web site has plenty of good content, or is worth reading, will eventually turn up in your searches or "worth reading" lists... and you'll have too much to read anyway.

### Starting Points

Obviously you need a starting point for the above process. Here are a few:

* [Russ White's Weekend Reads](https://rule11.tech/)
* [Scott Lowe's Technology Short Takes](https://blog.scottlowe.org/)
* [APNIC blog](https://blog.apnic.net/)
* [Olivier Bonaventure's Networking Notes](http://blog.computer-networking.info/)
* [Packet Pushers' Newsletter](https://packetpushers.net/newsletter/)
* I publish [Worth Reading](/tag/worth-reading/) articles almost every weekend.

I know I've missed some good ones -- write a comment ;)
