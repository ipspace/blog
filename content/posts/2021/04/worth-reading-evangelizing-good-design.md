Scott Berkun wrote [another great article](https://scottberkun.com/2021/the-insiders-guide-to-evangelizing-good-design/) that's equally applicable to the traditional notion of design (his specialty) and the network design. Read it, replace *design* with *network design*, and use its lessons. Here's just a sample:

* Convincing people is a social process
* Aim for small wins, not conversions of belief systems
* Allies matter more than ideas
* Design maturity grows one step at a time.
