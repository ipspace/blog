Ansible and Jinja2 are [not an ideal platform for data manipulation](/kb/DataModels/65-Data-Transformation/#data-transformation-implementation-options), but sometimes it's easier to hack together something in Jinja2 than writing a Python filter. In those cases, you might find the  *[Data Model Transformation with Jinja2](https://github.com/PJO2/cheat-sheet/blob/master/Advanced_Jinja2.pdf)* by [Philippe Jounin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phjounin/) extremely useful.
