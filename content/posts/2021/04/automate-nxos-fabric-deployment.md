Some networking engineers breeze through our [Network Automation online course](https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions), others disappear after a while... and a few of those come back years later with a spectacular production-grade solution.

Stephen Harding is one of those. He attended the automation course in spring 2019 and I haven't heard from him in almost two years... until he submitted [one of the most mature data center fabric automation solutions](https://github.com/sjhloco/build_fabric) I've seen. 

Not only that, he documented the solution in a [long series of must-read blog posts](https://theworldsgonemad.net/2021/automate-dc-pt1/). Hope you'll find them useful; I liked them so much I immediately saved them to Internet Archive (just in case).
