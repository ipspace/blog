As I started [Software Gone Wild podcast](https://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild/) in June 2014, I wanted to help networking engineers grow beyond the traditional networking technologies. It's only fitting to conclude this project almost seven years and 116 episodes later with a similar theme [Avi Freedman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avifreedman/) proposed when we started discussing podcast topics in late 2020: how do we make networking attractive to young engineers.

[Elisa Jasinska](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Elisa_Jasinska) and [Roopa Prabhu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roopa-prabhu-5678541/) joined Avi and me, and we had a lively discussion that I hope you'll find interesting.
