title: 'Planning the Extended Coffee Break: Three Months Later'
---
It's almost exactly three months since I announced [ipSpace.net going on an extended coffee break](/2021/01/planning-coffee-break.html). We had some ideas of what we plan to do at that time, but there were still many gray areas, and thanks to tons of discussions I had with many of my friends, subscribers, and readers, they mostly [crystallized into this](https://www.ipspace.net/Break/Overview):

**You're trusting me to deliver**. We added a "*you might want to read this first*" warning to the checkout process, and there was no noticeable drop in revenue. Thanks a million for your vote of confidence!

**No, I'm not about to retire** -- I was told in no uncertain terms I would become insufferable if I did that. I plan to keep doing what I was doing for the last decade but at a lower intensity. Right now, it looks like I could comfortably do one live session per month as I promised.

**We'll keep the online courses active**. There are no live events planned, but if you'd prefer having lifelong access to the course material instead of Expert Subscription, you already have a chance of buying that. I will keep supporting you in your studies and review hands-on assignments for at least 12 months after you purchase the course. I'm also considering regular whiteboarding discussions (no promises, though).

**We shut down the Software Gone Wild podcast**. The last episode will be published next week (it doesn't make sense to do it on Good Friday). I have a few ideas about what I might be doing instead of that, from a Q&A-type podcast (stealing the idea from Cal Newport) to one-on-one chats with drastically simplified logistics.

Now that we're changing things, we're looking around at what else could be changed. We might replace the somewhat-stalled GoToWebinar with Zoom (a pilot session is running this afternoon).
