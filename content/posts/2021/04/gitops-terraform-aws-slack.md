I know the title sounds like a buzzword-bingo-winning clickbait, but it's true. [Adrian Giacometti](https://adriangiacometti.net/index.php/about-adrian/) decided to merge the topics of two [ipSpace.net online courses](https://www.ipspace.net/Courses) and automated deployment of AWS security rules using Terraform within GitLab CI pipeline, with Slack messages serving as manual checks and approvals.

Not only did he do a great job mastering- and gluing together so many diverse bits and pieces, he also documented the solution and published the source code:

* Part 1: [Cloud &amp; Network automation challenge: Deploy Security Rules in a DevOps/GitOps world with AWS, Terraform, GitLab CI, Slack, and Python (special guest FastAPI)](https://adriangiacometti.net/index.php/2021/04/08/cloud-network-automation-challenge-part-1-3/)
* Part 2: [AWS, Terraform and FastAPI](https://adriangiacometti.net/index.php/2021/04/08/cloud-network-automation-challenge-part-2-3/)
* Part 3: [GitLab CI, Slack, and Python](https://adriangiacometti.net/index.php/2021/04/08/cloud-network-automation-challenge-part-3-3/)
* Source code: [aegiacometti/devops_cloud_challenge Â· GitLab](https://gitlab.com/aegiacometti/devops_cloud_challenge)
