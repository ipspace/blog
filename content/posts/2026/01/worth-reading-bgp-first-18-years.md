If you're at all interested in the history of networking, you simply MUST watch the [BGP at 18: Lessons In Protocol Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAOVNYSnL7k) lecture by Dr. Yakov Rekhter recorded in 2007 (as you can probably guess from the awful video quality) (HT: [Berislav Todorovic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beri1/) via LinkedIn).
