[David Gee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davedotdev/) was time-pressed to set up a demo network to showcase his [network automation solution](https://curvium.com/services/software/) and found that a Ubuntu VM running _[netlab](https://netlab.tools/)_ to orchestrate [Arista cEOS containers](https://blog.ipspace.net/2025/02/arista-ceos-arm-apple-silicon/) on his [Apple Silicon laptop](https://blog.ipspace.net/2024/03/netlab-bgp-apple-silicon/) was exactly what he needed.

I fixed a few blog posts based on his feedback (I can't tell you how much I appreciate receiving a detailed "you should fix this stuff" message, and how rare it is, so thanks a million!), and David was kind enough to add a delightful cherry on top of that cake with this wonderful blurb:

> Netlab has been a lifesaver. Ivan’s entire approach, from the software to collecting instructions and providing a meaningful information trail, enabled me to go from zero to having a functional lab in minutes. It has been an absolute lifesaver.
>
> I can be lazy with the infrastructure side, because he’s done all of the hard work. Now I get to concentrate on the value-added functionality of my own systems and test with the full power of an automated and modern network lab. Game-changing.
