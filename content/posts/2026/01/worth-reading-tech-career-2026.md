There's no "[networking in 20xx](/2024/01/networking-2024/)" video this year, so this [insightful article by Anil Dash](https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/05/a-tech-career-in-2026/) will have to do ;) He seems to be based in Silicon Valley, so keep in mind the [Three IT Geographies](https://it20.info/2012/09/cloud-and-the-three-it-geographies-silicon-valley-us-and-rest-of-the-world/), but one cannot beat advice like this:

> So much opportunity, inspiration, creativity, and possibility lies in applying the skills and experience that you may have from technological disciplines in other realms and industries that are often far less advanced in their deployment of technologies.

As well as:

> This too shall pass. One of the great gifts of working in technology is that it’s given so many of us the habit of constantly learning, of always being curious and paying attention to the new things worth discovering.

Hope you'll find it helpful and at least a bit inspiring.
