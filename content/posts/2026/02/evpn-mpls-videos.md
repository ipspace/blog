While we're mostly discussing EVPN in conjunction with VXLAN encapsulation, its initial use case was as an alternate control plane for MPLS networks.

Krzysztof Szarkowicz had a great presentation describing the [specifics of EVPN in MPLS-Based Environments](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=EVPN#SP) a few years ago. Those videos (part of the [EVPN Technical Deep Dive](https://www.ipspace.net/EVPN_Technical_Deep_Dive) webinar) are now public; you can watch them without an ipSpace.net account.
