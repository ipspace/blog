Want to spend an hour or two configuring some cool stuff this weekend? How about [getting SR-MPLS to work with IS-IS and building a BGP-free core with it](https://isis.bgplabs.net/advanced/10-sr/)?

If you already set up your own _netlab_ environment, you probably know what to do (or you can get the [details here](https://isis.bgplabs.net/1-setup/)). Alternatively, you can [click here](https://github.com/codespaces/new/bgplab/isis) to start the lab in your browser [using GitHub Codespaces](https://isis.bgplabs.net/4-codespaces/). After starting the lab environment, change the directory to `advanced/10-sr` and execute **netlab up**.
