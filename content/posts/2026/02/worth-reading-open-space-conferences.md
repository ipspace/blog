Following a link in [another Martin Fowler's blog post](https://martinfowler.com/fragments/2026-02-04.html), I stumbled upon [his thoughts](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OpenSpace.html) on [Open Space events](https://openspaceworld.org/wp2/) -- a way to set up self-organizing events.

I'm not sure I'm brave (or young) enough to try it out, but if you're planning to organize a small gathering (like a local Network Operator Group), this might be an interesting, slightly more structured approach than a Net::Beer event. It would also be nice to know whether someone managed to pull it off in an online format.
