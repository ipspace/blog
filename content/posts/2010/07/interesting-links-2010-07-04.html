<p>After my <a href="http://twitter.com/ioshints/status/17596339921">STP-is-like-hand-grenade</a> tweet, several friends sent me links to <a href="http://www.cio.com.au/article/65115/all_systems_down/RT">All Systems Down: an epic STP fail</a>. I am positive smaller STP failures happen on a daily basis, but are fixed too fast to be honored with an extensive case study. Nevertheless, vendors are furiously trying to persuade you that L2 switching (formerly known as <em>bridging</em>) is the sexiest thing since Paris Hilton, the last one being Cisco with its <a href="http://www1.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps9441/ps9402/white_paper_c11-605488.html">FabricPath announcement</a>. Some of us will definitely enjoy the show ...</p>
<p>Another long-term grudge of mine got somewhat more fact-based: <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/handheld/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=225702079&amp;subSection=News">Nielsen study supposedly reported that 6% of mobile users cause 50% of the traffic</a>. While this could cause some more people to believe that tiered data plans (or usage caps) might make sense, I am positive this issue will continue going the way global warming went years ago.</p>
<p>And, last but definitely not least, there’s another <a href="http://packetpushers.net/show-9-bogon-poetry/">Packet Pushers podcast</a> well worth listening to. Where else could someone start discussing new ASA 8.3 features only to realize a minute later that he’s praising the virtues of Cisco IOS Zone Based Firewalls? If only they would have remembered to <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2006/11/deploying-zone-based-firewalls.html">mention my ZBF book</a> ;)</p>
