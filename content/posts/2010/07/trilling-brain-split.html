<p>The split personality Cisco has exposed at Cisco Live 2010 is amazing: on one hand you have the Data Center team <a href="/2010/07/its-truly-sad-day/">touting the benefits of <em>Routing at Layer 2</em></a><em> </em>(an oxymoron if I’ve ever seen one), on the other hand you have Russ White extolling the virtues of good layer-3 design in the CCDE training (the quote I like most: “It all meets at Layer 3 ... that’s why CCDE is layer-3 centric”). If you’re confused, you’re not the only one</p>
