<p>A simplistic explanation of EIGRP <strong>offset-list </strong>configuration command you might see every now and then is “it adjusts the RD/FD to influence route selection”. If that would be the case, the adjustment would not be propagated to upstream routers (remember: only the EIGRP vector metric is sent in the routing updates, not RD or FD) resulting in potential routing loops (it’s never a good idea to use one set of metrics and propagate another set of metrics to your neighbors).</p>
<p>In reality, the EIGRP offset lists adjust the <em>delay </em>portion of the EIGRP vector metric (which <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/06/manipulating-eigrp-metrics.html">linearly influences the RD/FD value</a>). You can increase <del class="wrong">or decrease</del> the value of the <em>delay </em>metric for EIGRP updates received or sent through a specific interface (or all interfaces). You can also use an access list in the <strong>offset-list </strong>command, applying changes only to specific IP prefixes (very similar to what I described in the <a href="http://www.nil.si/ipcorner/ScalablePolicyRouting/"><em>Scalable policy routing</em></a><em> </em><a href="http://www.nil.si/ipcorner">IP corner</a> article).
