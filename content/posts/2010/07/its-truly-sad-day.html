<p>When Cisco’s <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps9441/ps9402/white_paper_c11-605488.html">white paper calls bridging <em>Routing at Layer-2</em></a>. I’ve come to expect gimmicks like this from startups trying to woo clueless customers, but Cisco had so far kept to a certain level of correctness at least in their technical documents. One can only wonder what’s next in the industry-wide drive to try to persuade us that square pegs can easily fit into round holes.</p>
