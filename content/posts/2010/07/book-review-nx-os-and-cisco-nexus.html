It’s targeted at existing Cisco IOS users and covers a wide range of topics, including layer-2 and layer-3 configuration (covering all routing protocols), IP multicast, security, high availability, serviceability, unified fabric (in less details than I would appreciate) and even the weird world of Nexus 1000V.</p>
<p>If you’re new to networking, you should start somewhere else; this book assumes you know the theory and the configuration basics and concentrates primarily on the differences between Cisco IOS and NX-OS. Sometimes it helps if you have experience with the Catalyst branch of Cisco IOS. I was struggling with the layer-2 chapter due to its reliance on Catalyst IOS knowledge; spending a bit more time explaining various interface types and how they all fit together would not hurt.</p>
<!--more--><p>The skimming of important details is also one of the few drawbacks of this book. For example: session manager and device contexts are mentioned in passing; for me they could be two of the cornerstones of NX-OS improvements over Cisco IOS. Some of the topics were evidently thrown in post-haste (layer-2 data center interconnect gets half a page) and others could benefit from a more solid framework: Cisco TrustSec section never expands beyond few basic configuration commands and long examples that are useless without understanding the big picture and I’m still confused by the various virtual port types used by Nexus 1000V. The unified fabric chapter could also be a bit longer and more detailed.</p>
<p>The book has only two major omissions: OTV is mentioned in passing and IPv6 is not covered anywhere. The first omission is sad, considering that Cisco’s marketing has been promoting OTV for months (the book was published in June 2010 and I’ve seen the first Works-in-PowerPoint-Only configurations a while ago). I can only hope that the lack of IPv6 coverage (IPv6 is otherwise supported by NX-OS) doesn’t indicate an <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/12/ipv6-in-campus-but-not-in-data-center.html">IPv6-ignorant mindset</a> in Cisco’s Data Center business unit.</p>
<p>Even considering all the mentioned drawbacks (and every excellent book has a few), this is exactly the book you need if you’re asked to install a Nexus switch in the next few months ... and if you need a comprehensive overview of data center, server and storage technologies, there’s always my <a href="http://datacenter20.eventbrite.com/">Data Center 3.0 for Networking Engineers</a> webinar.</p>
