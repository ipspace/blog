<p>When I started using Blogger, it had no “share-me” buttons, so I had to use Feedburner’s FeedFlares to implement the sharing line at the bottom of the post. FeedFlares use JavaScript and each “share-me” line was an extra HTTP request, sometimes resulting in very long loading times of the blog’s home page.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Blogger has implemented sharing buttons and I developed some small bits of JavaScript code for individual articles. As of today, FeedFlares are gone and the first page should load significantly faster than before.</p>
<p>On a tangential note, if you like my articles, please share them. The more you tweet or blog about them, the easier it will be for other networking engineers to find them. Thank you!</p>
