<p>My next webinar is covering the topics I wanted to address for over half a year, but never found time to do it: <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/DataCenterIntro">the facts and the hype in the Data Center as seen from the perspective of a networking engineer</a>. I was planning to run it sometime in autumn, but the recent <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/06/thrills-of-trill.html">TRILL-focused hype</a> has prompted me to schedule it sooner.</p>
<p>In two hours (probably slightly more, my two-hour webinars are usually almost three hours long), we’ll cover:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Storage technologies and protocols, including iSCSI and FCoE;</li>
<li>Server virtualization, including virtual machine mobility and high-availability;</li>
<li>Differences between routing and bridging (including VLANs and PVLANs) and the need for layer-3 routing in Data Center;</li>
<li>Emerging technologies, including TRILL, DCB, L2MP and LISP;</li>
<li>Multi-site considerations and transport options (DWDM, VPLS, MPLS/VPN and OTV).</li>
</ul>
