<p>Regular readers of my blog might remember that I’ve hard-earned a prestigious “<a href="#c2566877463081051127">Certified Religious Bovine Professional</a>” title after getting into the <a href="http://thinkingproblemmanagement.blogspot.com/2008/10/firewalls-best-practice-holy-cows.html">firewall holy cows</a> debate. </p>
<p>This time, my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/07/bridging-and-routing-is-there.html">bridging</a>/<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/07/trilling-brain-split.html">TRILL</a>-focused posts earned me the distinguished “<a href="http://twitter.com/bradhedlund/statuses/18540889223">old-school network guru</a> from an <a href="http://twitter.com/bradhedlund/statuses/18541080479">Ivory Tower</a>” designation, together with a bit of a <a href="http://twitter.com/bradhedlund/statuses/18541080479">career advice</a> (“<em>Dont be the guy saying 'No' to DC virtualization from your Ivory Tower</em>”)... or it could be that Brad Hedlund had someone else in mind and I’m just a presumptuous <a href="http://etherealmind.com/network-dictionary-goners/">GONER</a>; after all, there are hundreds of people writing about DC bridging these days.</p>
<p>Anyhow, on the odd chance that I was included in that honored group, Brad didn’t need to worry about my career: </p>
<!--more--><ul class="ListParagraph"><li>We (<a href="http://www.nil.com/">NIL Data Communications</a>) have been using VMware server virtualization since 2002, when we started using it for non-critical IT services. At the same time, we’ve deployed a SAN network to support VM migration between physical servers.</li>
<li>Server virtualization is one of the cornerstones of our scalable <a href="http://www.nil.com/C1257455003A036D/html/remote+labs">remote labs</a> implementation; the first remote labs using virtualization were the security labs supporting CCSP curriculum in 2003;</li>
<li>At the moment, we have only two or three bare-metal servers; every else is virtualized.</li>
<li>We’re heavy users of VMotion and VMware power optimizations. After all, running 800 physical devices in a remote lab environment consumes a lot of power and we’re turning off everything we can when it’s not used (including physical servers, routers and switches).</li>
<li>Based on our hands-on experience with server virtualization, we’ve created the <a href="http://www.nil.si/go/HyperCenter">NIL Hypercenter architecture</a>, where we try to balance the needs for security, management and business agility.</li>
<li>Based on our investment in VMware technologies, we’re VMWare Enterprise Partner and VMWare Authorized Consultant Gold Partner. Likewise, we’re Authorized Technology Provider for Data Center Unified Computing (UCS) and <a href="http://www.nil.com/C1257455003A036D/html/certifications">a few other bits and pieces</a>.</li>
<li>Last but not least, we’re offering our own <a href="http://flipit.nil.com/">IT-as-an-infrastructure cloud service</a> for over a year. Obviously, everything we do there is virtualized and (just as a side-remark) we’re just now introducing Cisco UCS into that environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, I know all this is blatant self-promotion (and a shouting match ... but then the title warned you it’s all off-topic), but sometimes one has to mention that he has a bit more than an academic background.</p>
