title: Why is TRILL not routing at layer-2
url: /2010/07/why-is-trill-not-routing-at-layer-2.html
---

<p>Peter John Hill made an interesting observation in a comment to my “<a href="/2010/07/trilling-brain-split.html"><em>The TRILLing brain split</em></a>” post; he wrote “TRILL really is routing at layer 2.”</p>
<p>He’s partially right – TRILL uses a routing protocol (IS-IS) and the TRILL protocol used to forward Ethernet frames (TRILL data frames) definitely has all the attributes of a layer-3 protocol:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>TRILL data frames have layer-3 addresses (RBridge nickname);</li>
<li>They have a hop count;</li>
<li>Layer-2 next-hop is always the MAC address of the next-hop RBridge;</li>
<li>As the TRILL data frames are propagated between RBridges, the outer MAC header changes.</li>
</ul>
<!--more--><p>However, once the TRILL infrastructure is set up and the best paths are computed, bridging forwarding paradigms are used to forward host-to-host data traffic, including building MAC address table by listening to data traffic and flooding of packets sent to unknown MAC destination. TRILL therefore retains most of the non-scalable properties of transparent bridging with these exceptions:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Convergence is faster and more predictable;</li>
<li>Data forwarding can use all the available links;</li>
<li>Core RBridges (those that have no non-TRILL links) do not need to know the end-station MAC addresses;</li>
<li>Edge RBridges need to know end-station MAC addresses only for the VLANs in which they participate (but that’s also true in existing well-designed bridged networks).</li>
</ul>
