<p>In a bout of stupidity only someone like Dilbert could commit I’ve scheduled two webinars in the week of <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le21/le34/learning_networkers_home.html">Cisco Live</a>. Fortunately one of the readers was very quick to point it out and I’ve rescheduled <a href="http://dmvpn.eventbrite.com/"><em>DMVPN: Advanced and Crazy Scenarios</em></a> and <a href="http://choosevpn.eventbrite.com/"><em>Choose the Optimal VPN Service</em></a> for July 7<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>On a sunnier front, I’d never got so many registrations in the first 24 hours as I did after <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/06/dmvpn-advanced-and-crazy-scenarios.html">announcing the DMVPN webinar</a>. The number of seats might be limited (I need to check our Webex license); it’s probably a good idea to hurry up and <a href="http://dmvpn.eventbrite.com/">register</a>.</p>
