<p>To understand the principles of DMVPN Phase I, remember these facts:</p>
<!--more--><ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Spokes use point-to-point GRE tunnels;</li>
<li>Hub site has multipoint GRE tunnel;</li>
<li>All the traffic flows through the hub site;</li>
<li>The next-hop for routes received over DMVPN must be the hub site;</li>
<li>NHRP is used by the hub site to get spokes’ tunnel endpoint addresses.</li>
<li>Spoke sites use NHRP just to register with the hub site.</li>
</ul>
