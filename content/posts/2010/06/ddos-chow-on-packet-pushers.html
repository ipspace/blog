<p>Yesterday I finally found time to listen to the <a href="http://etherealmind.com/packet-pushers-show-6-chewing-on-ddos/?utm_source=ioshints">DDoS chewing podcast on Packet Pushers</a>. While I know quite a bit about the technical solutions, their focus on the big picture and Service Provider offerings was a truly refreshing one (after all, if you’re under attack, it’s best if your upstream SP filters the junk). </p>
<p>They also mentioned a few interesting application-related issues that will definitely help me streamline my web sites (for example: once your load goes above a certain threshold, start serving cached data instead of retrieving it live from the database) and discussed an interesting case study where a networking engineer (Greg, if I’m not mistaken) managed to persuade the programmers to optimize the application, thus saving the company a lot of money in the long run.</p>
<p>Even if DDoS protection might not be relevant to your current job position and although a lot of their discussion was spinning around SP offerings and application-level solutions, I would strongly recommend that you <a href="http://packetpushers.net/show-6-chewing-on-ddos/">listen to the podcast</a>. After all, it never hurts to glance around your sandbox and consider other perspectives (and I definitely enjoyed the view).</p>
