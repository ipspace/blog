<p>It’s amazing what people would try to patent ... and it’s even more amazing what gets past the examiners. IBM has <a href="http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/pdfs/patent_id/7734818.html">managed to patent passing <strong>ipv6 </strong>or <strong>dhcp </strong>argument</a> to indicate an IP host should network-boot over IPv6 or using DHCP. The idea is so trivial it’s almost not worth mentioning and goes along the lines of: “usually we use <em>BOOTP</em> and <em>TFTP</em> to get network boot parameters, but imagine we could pass <em>DHCP </em>as the argument to the boot routine and then it would use <em>DHCP </em>instead of <em>BOOTP</em><em>”</em>.</p>
<p>The patent supposedly covers a very specific case, but (to my untrained eye) the claims are written in a way that could cover almost any IPv6- or DHCP-assisted network boot (or at least give lawyers plenty of stuff to charge for) ... exactly what we needed with all the other roadblocks and stumbling stones to IPv6 deployment.</p>
