<p>When developing the <a href="http://choosevpn.eventbrite.com/"><em>Choose the optimal VPN service</em></a> webinar, I decided to test everything I was talking about in a lab (you wouldn’t believe how much misinformation is spread across the Internet) and ended up with several DMVPN scenarios that most people would consider to be somewhere between peculiar and outrageous.</p>
<p class="note">The best one: DMVPN Phase III network with ODR between spokes and level-1 hubs and OSPF inside a hierarchy of hubs ... of course fully redundant all the way down to the spokes. </p>
<p class="warn">The webinar has been rescheduled to July 7<sup>th</sup> (Cisco Live is taking place from June 27<sup>th</sup> to July 1<sup>st</sup>).</p>
<p>The design scenarios were simply too god to be left to rot on my hard drive (some of them were screaming to be documented and talked about), so I organized them into a progressively evolving story described in the <a href="http://dmvpn.eventbrite.com/"><em>DMVPN: Advanced and crazy scenarios</em></a> webinar.</p>
<p>If you’re a CCNP/CCIE-level engineer interested in DMVPN, I’m positive you’ll enjoy this webinar (<a href="http://dmvpn.eventbrite.com/">click here to register</a>) ... and I’ll try to serve you as many curveballs as I can manage to fit within two hours.</p>
