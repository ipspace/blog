<p>One could understand <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/05/ipv6-myths-are-alive-and-well.html">application programmers</a> falling into the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/03/more-details-seven-ipv6-myths.html">traps of IPv6 myths</a>, but when it happens to Cisco’s Global PR Manager, it’s embarrassing. <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/news/comments/john_chambers_outlines_ciscos_commitment_to_ipv6_at_google_conference/">Marc Musgrove was promoting at least one and a half myths</a> (I’m still not sure about easier mobility with IPv6) in his latest blog post.</p>
<p><strong>Simplified packet header for routing efficiency</strong>. This is a new one for me (and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/02/ipv6-myths.html">I thought I’ve seen them all</a>), but no less bogus than any other. <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/strategy/docs/gov/IPv6perf_wp1f.pdf">Cisco’s own measurements</a> confirm that IPv6 performs almost equally well (or marginally worse) than IPv4. There’s no improvement and no increased efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory IPSec implementation for all IPv6 devices</strong>. While this is technically true, it’s at least misleading, as most readers automatically assume it means any host-to-host communication can be easily encrypted. Not necessarily true, you’ve implemented a compliant IPSec implementation even if you just recognize the IPSec header without having any ESP (encryption) or AH (integrity/origin authentication) capabilities.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s time we all grow up and admit the only benefit of IPv6 is its larger address space.</p>
