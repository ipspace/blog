<p class="info">Quick summary for the <a href="/2010/03/qppb-in-mpls-vpn.html">differently attentive</a>: Even without the DNS processing, NAT-PT and NAT64 differ from the perspective of peer-to-peer applications. The differences don’t matter for IPv6 clients connecting to IPv4 servers.</p>
<p>Whenever I’m talking about NAT64, someone would say “we’re already using it”. As it turns out, they’re usually using <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2766">NAT-PT</a>, which looks a lot like <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful-11">NAT64</a> from afar (after all, they both allow IPv6-only clients to connect to IPv4-only servers). However, there are significant differences between the two, the most important one being DNS64, which handles DNS processing completely outside of the forwarding path (NAT-PT has embedded DNS Application Level Gateway, which was one of the major reasons NAT-PT was <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4966">declared broken beyond hope</a>).</p>
<!--more--><p>Taking away the DNS processing, the actual protocol translation functions performed by NAT64 and the IPv6-to-IPv4 part of NAT-PT look very similar. I didn’t want to waste time going through the RFCs and comparing the gory details, so I tried to find out whether someone has already done that job. Not surprisingly, Google helped:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wing-nat-pt-replacement-comparison-02">draft-wing-nat-pt-replacement-comparison-02</a> compares numerous NAT-PT replacements, including NAT64. It’s sketchy on details, but if you’re interested in various v4/v6 transition mechanisms, it’s definitely worth reading.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.viagenie.ca/publications/2009-11-06-3gpp-ietf-ipv6-shanghai-nat64.pdf">A presentation by Simon Perreault</a> describes the technical glitches I’ve been looking for. Apart from the DNS-related changes (page #4), the detailed changes to NAT functionality are described on page #11.</li>
</ul>
<p>The differences in TCP/UDP translations between NAT-PT and NAT-64 are relevant only to peer-to-peer applications; IPv6-client-to-IPv4-server applications work well with both NAT-PT and NAT-64:</p>
<ul><li>NAT <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4787">mapping</a> and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4787">filtering</a> behavior matter only in a peer-to-peer scenario or when you have a server using a dynamic TCP/UDP port situated behind NAT.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_TCPConnectionEstablishmentProcessTheThreeWayHandsh-4.htm">TCP simultaneous-open</a> can only happen in a peer-to-peer environment. </li>
<li><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4787">Hairpinning</a> is required only when two IPv6 hosts behind a NAT64 device want to communicate using their NATed IPv4 addresses.</li>
</ul>
