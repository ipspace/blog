<p><a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2010/the-tradeoff-of-the-hyperlink/">Another article from Scott Berkun</a> pointed me to a wonderful tool: <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a>. Imagine being able to read web pages in decently-sized font on pleasant background and without all the navigational and ad clutter. It makes my reading experience infinitely more pleasurable; now I can manage to read blog posts that are several pages long without getting a headache.</p>
<p>Safari 5 has a similar functionality already built in: a <em>Reader </em>button appears next to the URL and once you click it, you get the main text of the web page in a pop-up frame. It works a bit better than Readability (which sometimes positions the text annoyingly close to the left side of the browser window), but is (contrary to Readability) not easily configurable; Steve knows best what you need. Fortunately, <a href="http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/5971/safari-5-how-to-hack-and-customize-the-reader/">thereâ€™s almost always a workaround</a>.</p>
