<p>In the recent months, there’s been a lot of buzz about next-generation Data Center bridging, including the <a href="http://community.brocade.com/community/brocadeblogs/wingspan/blog/2010/03/11/just-like-the-world-the-network-should-be-flat"><em>Earth Is Flat </em>rediscovery from Brocade</a> (I thought that was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth">settled in middle ages</a>) and a <a href="http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com.au/articles/41575-Is-TRILL-ready-to-replace-spanning-tree-">TRILL article in SearchNetworking</a> (which quoted both Greg and me as being on the opposite sides of the TRILL debate).</p>
<p>The more I think about this problem, the more I’m wondering whether we really need large-scale bridging in data centers (it looks like <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/06/worse-is-better.html">Google can live quite happily without it</a>). We definitely need some bridging, but generic large-scale inter-site monstrosity? I doubt.</p>
<p>Please try to help me: forget all the “this is how we do it” presumptions, figure out a scenario where you absolutely need bridging and describe it in the comments.</p>
<!--more--><p>There are four obvious answers: </p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>FCoE (<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/05/iscsi-moores-law-won.html">you should really use iSCSI</a>);</li>
<li>Distributed firewalls (more about this one in a separate post);</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Load_Balancing_Services">Microsoft Network Load Balancing</a> (which should have been banned from the DC environment before it got implemented);</li>
<li>Live virtual machine migration (aka VMotion if you use VMware).</li>
</ul>
<p> Anything else?</p>
