<p>If you’re based in Europe or Africa (or don’t mind attending a webinar very early in the morning like some of my US-based students), you can take advantage of the <em>VPN Day Combo</em>: if you register for both VPN webinars on July 7<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span>, you’ll get a 20% discount on the second ticket ($39.99 instead of $49.99). </p>
<p>To get the VPN Day discount, register for any one of the two VPN webinars (<a href="http://choosevpn.eventbrite.com/">Choose the Optimal VPN Service</a> or <a href="http://dmvpn.eventbrite.com">DMVPN: Advanced and Crazy Scenarios</a>); the order confirmation page contains the discount code and the link to the registration page for the second webinar.</p>
