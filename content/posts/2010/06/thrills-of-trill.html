<p>Tired of losing <a href="http://etherealmind.com/bisectional-bandwidth-l2mp-trill-bridges-design-value/">half of your bandwidth to spanning tree</a>? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRILL_(Computer_Networking)">TRILL</a> will solve all your problems, bring the world peace and make better coffee than Starbucks (hint: the second claim is fake and the third one is not so hard to achieve). </p>
<p>Undoubtedly TRILL is an interesting technology that can alleviate the spanning tree limitations. Unfortunately I’ve seen a very similar technology being heavily misused in the past (resulting in some fantastic failures) and remain <a href="http://etherealmind.com/trill-it%e2%80%99s-a-deja-vu-all-over-again/">skeptical about the deployment of TRILL</a>. My worst case scenario: TRILL will make it too simple to deploy plug-and-pray bridged (vendors will call them “switched”) networks with no underlying design that will grow beyond control and implode.</p>
<p>Greg Ferro has kindly invited me to be a guest author on his excellent blog <em>Etherealmind.com</em> and I simply had to spill my thoughts on TRILL in the <a href="http://etherealmind.com/trill-it%e2%80%99s-a-deja-vu-all-over-again/"><em>TRILL: It’s a DéJà-Vu All Over Again</em></a><em> </em>article after they’ve been <a href="http://etherealmind.com/show-5-deep-dive-data-centre-ethernet-trill-rbridges/">discussing it during one of the Packet Pushers podcast</a>.</p>
