<p>Jan Žorž from <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgo6.si%2Fdva-slovenca-na-googlovem-ipv6-odru%2F&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sl=sl&amp;tl=en">go6.si</a> is obviously a very successful IPv6 evangelist: not only did he manage to organize <a href="http://go6.si/3rd-slo-ipv6-summit-announcement-english/">numerous</a> IPv6 summits in Slovenia (which is probably one of the reasons <a href="http://www.arnes.si/en/news/news-item/article/slovenia-scores-in-the-ipv6-ripeness/518.html">Slovenia is the leading European country on the RIPEness scale</a>); he’s also helped persuade the mobile industry to roll out pilot IPv6 services. Right now we have two mobile operators piloting IPv6; both <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgo6.si%2Fdva-slovenca-na-googlovem-ipv6-odru%2F&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sl=sl&amp;tl=en">dual-stack (with two PDP contexts)</a> and IPv6 roaming are working flawlessly.</p>
<p class="note">BTW, Jan still doesn’t understand the need to blog in English, so you all the links to his web site I’m including in this post are converted into English-resembling form by Google Translate.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, such feats did not go unnoticed: Jan has been invited to present at the <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/ipv6implementors/2010/agenda">Google IPv6 Implementors Conference</a> and managed to <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgo6.si%2Fdva-slovenca-na-googlovem-ipv6-odru%2F&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sl=sl&amp;tl=en">persuade Google to include an engineer from our local CPE manufacturer</a> in the IPv6 CPE vendor panel.</p>
<p>I have nothing more to say than: CONGRATULATIONS &amp; GOOD LUCK!</p>
