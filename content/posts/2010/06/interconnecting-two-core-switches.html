<p>Ethan Banks has a great article @ PACKETattack: in <a href="http://packetattack.wordpress.com/2010/06/17/assembly-required-interconnecting-2-ethernet-chassis-switches/"><em>Assembly Required â€“ Interconnecting 2 Ethernet Chassis Switches</em></a><em> </em>he describes various options you have when you want to connect your redundant core switches. Using more than one physical link is the obvious choice; most people are careful enough to use at least two linecards, but the true magic begins when you start considering the bandwidth allocation to individual linecards and port groups within linecards.</p>
