Just in case you haven't noticed it yet: <a href="http://blog.internetworkexpert.com/2010/02/22/understanding-mstp/">Petr Lapukhov wrote a great (and very long) article describing MSTP</a>. It covers everything, from the basics to multi-region design and interoperability issues. Highly recommended reading.
