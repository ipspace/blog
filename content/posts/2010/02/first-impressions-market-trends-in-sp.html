<p>Thursday’s “<a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Market_trends_in_Service_Provider_networks">Market trends in Service Provider networks</a>” webinar was even better than I’ve hoped for. The audience was great: mostly System Engineers with 5+ years of networking experience, so we spent more time on interesting details. </p>
<p class="note">The presentation was initially targeted at sales support teams or account managers, but with attendees like I had in this session I could really go as far beyond the slides as needed.</p>
<p>Let me just share two quotes from the evaluation forms with you (<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/03/market-trends-in-sp-networks-survey.html">the final results</a> will require a bit of Excel massaging):</p>
