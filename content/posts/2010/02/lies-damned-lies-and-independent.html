title: Lies, damned lies and independent competitive test reports

<p>When the friendly sales guy from your favorite vendor honors you with an “independent test lab” report on the newest wonderful gadget he’s trying to sell you, there’s one thing you can be sure of: the box behaves as described in the report. The “independent” labs are earning too much money verifying the test results to participate in outright lies. Whether the results correlate with your needs is a different story, but we’ll skip this discussion.</p>
<p>However, when you’re faced with a competitive report from an independent test lab “sponsored” (read: paid) by one of the vendors, rest assured it’s as twisted as it can be (you should also suspect the sponsoring vendor has some significant issues he’s trying to cover). The report will dutifully list the test configurations and the test results ... without mentioning that the configurations and the tests were cherry-picked by the sponsoring vendor. You don’t believe me? Put on your most cynical glasses and read the <a href="http://www.tolly.com/companycontact.aspx"><em>About us</em></a><em> </em>statement from <a href="http://www.tolly.com/"><em>the premier independent test lab</em></a>.</p>
<p>You still want me to prove my point: look at the latest <a href="http://bladesmadesimple.com/2010/02/tolly-report-hp-flex-10-vs-cisco-ucs-network-bandwidth-scalability-comparison/">HP-versus-Cisco blade server test results</a> (paid by HP). They took an oversubscribed UCS chassis (it had 4 10GB uplinks and up to 8 servers) and compared it to an HP chassis with 8 servers and 8 10GB uplinks. Furthermore, Kevin Tolly himself admitted in the comments that they’ve really tested the bandwidth between the servers within the chassis (absolute kudos for being so frank), which you might suspect could be somewhat irrelevant in a typical deployment scenario.</p>
