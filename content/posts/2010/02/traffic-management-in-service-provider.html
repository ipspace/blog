The first article <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid103_gci1377635_mem1,00.html">analyses whether you need dedicated boxes doing the traffic management in your network</a>; the second one whether <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid103_gci1377639_mem1,00.html">you really need DPI to manage the traffic</a>.</p>
<p class="more">Traffic management and DPI are just two of the many topics covered in my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Market_trends_in_Service_Provider_networks"><em>Market trends in Service Provider networks</em></a> workshop.
