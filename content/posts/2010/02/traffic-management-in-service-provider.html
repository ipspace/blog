<p>I while ago I wrote two articles for SearchTelecom that deal with traffic management in Service Provider networks and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). The first article <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid103_gci1377635_mem1,00.html">analyses whether you need dedicated boxes doing the traffic management in your network</a>; the second one whether <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid103_gci1377639_mem1,00.html">you really need DPI to manage the traffic</a>.</p>
