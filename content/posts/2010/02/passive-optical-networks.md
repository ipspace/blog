When I've first heard about [Passive Optical Networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_optical_network), this blast from the past almost made my head explode. Imagine this: you're replacing obsolete copper cabling with fiber and decide to create shared media access network similar to the widely hated cable networks.

The only benefit of PON networks that I can see is that it only needs passive equipment at the concentration point. My list of drawbacks is huge, ranging from security concerns to service evolution. What's your opinion? Would you like to correct my bearing?
