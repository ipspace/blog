<p>When I’ve first heard about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_optical_network">Passive Optical Networks</a>, this blast from the past almost made my head explode. Imagine this: you’re replacing obsolete copper cabling with fiber and decide to create shared media access network similar to the widely hated cable networks.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/2010/02/PON.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="152" src="/2010/02/s400-PON.png" width="400"/></a></div>
<p>The only benefit of PON networks that I can see is that it only needs passive equipment at the concentration point. My list of drawbacks is huge, ranging from security concerns to service evolution. What’s your opinion? Would you like to correct my bearing?</p>
<p class="more">Passive Optical Networks are just one of the many topics covered in my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Market_trends_in_Service_Provider_networks"><em>Market trends in Service Provider networks</em></a> workshop. If you want to <a href="http://spmarkettrends.eventbrite.com/">register for the online event</a>, hurry up; you have only a few days left.</p>
