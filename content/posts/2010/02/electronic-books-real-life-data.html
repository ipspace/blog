<p>I had my yearly “paperwork day” today. As part of that ordeal I was sorting the Cisco Press book sales reports and stumbled across e-book data for my MPLS VPN books. I can’t tell you how well the Safari access is doing (electronic subscriptions are bundled with numerous totally unrelated items into the “Others” category), but the reports have separate line items for <em>PDF</em> and <em>Mobile</em> (I assume that’s Kindle) edition. The sales of these editions are negligible compared to the “regular” sales. </p>
<p>Obviously even the highly technical audience is not interested in electronic books (or <a href="/2010/01/rant-long-term-consequences-of-book.html">someone bought a single PDF copy that’s now enjoyed by the whole Internet</a>) ... or you feel (like I do) that the reference books belong on the bookshelf.</p>
