[![](http://www.ioshints.info/images/Wiki.png){.ImgFLTright}](http://wiki.nil.com/)If you're upgrading your Service Provider network from ATM- or SDH-based core to Carrier Ethernet core, you could be tempted to keep the unnumbered point-to-point links. The practice of using unnumbered P2P links is debatable, but if you want to, you can [configure them on VLAN interfaces in recent IOS releases](http://wiki.nil.com/Unnumbered_Ethernet_VLAN_interfaces).

You'll find more details (and caveats) in the [Unnumbered Ethernet VLAN interfaces](http://wiki.nil.com/Unnumbered_Ethernet_VLAN_interfaces) article in the [CT3 wiki](http://wiki.nil.com/).
