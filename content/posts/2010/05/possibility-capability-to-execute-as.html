<p>The "<a href="http://www.rationalsurvivability.com/blog/?p=1836">You can't secure the cloud</a>" article published by Hoff on <a href="http://www.rationalsurvivability.com/">Rational Survivability</a> discusses whether you can make the cloud solutions as secure as enterprise (walled garden) ones. Here's a great summary:</p>
<blockquote class="cite"><p>Yes, it’s true. It’s absolutely possible to engineer solutions across most cloud services today that meet or exceed the security provided within the walled gardens of your enterprise today.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">The realities of that statement come crashing down, however, when people confuse possibility with the capability to execute whilst not disrupting the business and not requiring wholesale re-architecture of applications, security, privacy, operations, compliance, economics, organization, culture and governance.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.rationalsurvivability.com/blog/?p=1836">rest of the article</a> is also well worth reading.</p>
