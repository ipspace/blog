<p>Whenever you decide to use MPLS/VPN services from a Service Provider, you’re effectively ripping out your network core (including the core routers) and replacing it with the layer-3 SP backbone (the equipment vendors or service providers sometimes fail to mention this fact).</p>
<p>The network core outsourcing usually makes sense from the financial perspective, but also creates a significant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in">lock-in</a> and high <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switching_barriers">switching costs</a> that you should consider in combination with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capex">CapEx</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_expense">OpEx</a> cost analysis when selecting your VPN service. We’ll discuss the benefits and drawbacks of MPLS/VPN and numerous other VPN technologies in the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Choose_the_optimal_VPN_service"><em>Choose the Optimum VPN Service</em></a><em> </em>webinar (<a href="http://choosevpn.eventbrite.com/">register here</a>).</p>
