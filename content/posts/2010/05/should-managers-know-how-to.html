<p>In another great blog post, Scott Berkun lays out his thoughts on <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2010/should-managers-know-how-to-code/">what managers of programming teams should be able to do</a>. You should read the whole article, as most concepts apply equally well to networking teams: if you’re a team leader, you should have decent knowledge of technology and its limitations, if you’re higher up the management chain, it’s more important that you can trust your people, work with them to reach good decisions ... and figure out when they’re bullshitting you.</p>
