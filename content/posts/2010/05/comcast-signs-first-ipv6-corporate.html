<p>Network World has recently published another “breaking news” article: <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/051710-comcast-first-ipv6-customer.html">Comcast has connected its first corporate customer to its dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 service</a>. Let me try to put the news in perspective:</p>
<ul><li>We (<a href="http://www.nil.com/english">NIL Data Communications</a>) were able to find two ISPs with production-grade dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 service in Slovenia (a country with 2 million people, which puts us somewhere between Manhattan and Queens).</li>
<li>We’ve got PI address space from RIPE a year ago.</li>
<li>We’ve been multihomed (via BGP) to both service providers for months.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what is Network World trying to tell us?</p>

<p class="note"><em>Disclaimer:</em> I am not trying to bash Comcast in any way. I know they’ve been among the first to realize IPv6 potential and have <a href="http://www.comcast6.net/">invested heavily in IPv6 infrastructure and technologies</a> (<a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/46600">DS-Lite</a> efforts were started by Comcast).</p>
