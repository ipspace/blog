title: CGv6 – how real is it?

<p>Last November I was <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/sp/comments/now_is_the_time_to_plan_for_your_ipv6_transition/">delighted to read the announcement describing how a module in CRS-1</a> was going to <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6553/brochure_c02-560497_ns1017_Networking_Solutions_Brochure.html">support CGN, NAT444, NAT64 and DS-Lite</a>. It looked like a major vendor has finally decided it’s time to solve the IPv4-to-IPv6 transition problem.</p>
<p>However, I was not able to find anything beyond a few fancy videos, a white paper and a brochure. Can anyone shed more light on CGv6? Have you seen it running outside of PowerPoint? When can an IPv6-embracing Service Provider expect to see it on an ASR 1000?</p>
<p class="note">And before you ask ... no, CGv6 is not described in <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Webinars">my webinars</a>; I only talk about features (not futures) that I was able to get my hands on.</p>
