<p>One would hope that the <a href="/2010/03/more-details-seven-ipv6-myths.html">IPv6 myths</a> are slowly fading away as more people get exposed to IPv6 ... but if you like them, don’t worry; they are constantly being recycled. The <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1578519"><em>IPv6: Why Bother?</em></a><em> </em>article published by InformIT is a perfect example:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">With IPv6, there are enough addresses now that every country or major network can be assigned a large range. It can then assign subranges within that to networks that it connects to, and so on. This hierarchical assignment (in theory, at least) simplifies routing decisions.</blockquote>
<!--more--><p>Unfortunately, that opportunity was lost at the moment when IPv6 architects <a href="/2009/05/lack-of-ipv6-multihoming-elephant-in.html">missed the multihoming implications</a> and limited IPv6 scope to layers <a href="/2009/08/what-went-wrong-tcpip-lacks-session.html">below TCP </a>(not to mention the <a href="/2009/08/what-went-wrong-socket-api.html">broken socket API</a>). The article <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1578519&amp;seqNum=2">continues with another myth</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">With IPv6, you can guarantee that any endpoint will support IPsec, which means that you can always establish an encrypted connection.</blockquote>
<p>Although IPSec is part of the IPv6 protocol stack and it’s mandatory to understand IPSec, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4294">encryption is not mandatory</a> ... and there’s always the small problem of mutual authentication and key distribution between unrelated set of hosts. We’ll continue using SSL for a long time.</p>
<p>However, I liked the <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1578519&amp;seqNum=3">discussion of the IPv6-related programming issues</a>, as it contains a nice and relevant TCP session establishment code example ... or maybe it was the sentence “Unfortunately, creating sockets is where things start to go wrong” that got my full attention ;)</p>
