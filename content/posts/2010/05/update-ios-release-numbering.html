<p>Phillip Remaker provided an excellent explanation of new IOS release numbering rules in a comment on the <a href="/2010/04/did-you-notice-151t-is-released.html"><em>Did you notice 15.1T is released?</em></a> post. Here’s a short summary:</p>
<ul><li>15.0(1)M was an exception which consolidated the transition from 12.x rules to 15.x rules.</li>
<li>Every new 15.x epoch will start with feature releases (15.1(1)T, 15.1(2)T ...) and end with a mature <em>mainline </em>15.x(y)M release, which will get bug fixes and maintenance rebuilds.</li>
<li>15.x+1(1)T will appear approximately at the same time as 15.x(y)M and the whole cycle will repeat.</li>
</ul>
