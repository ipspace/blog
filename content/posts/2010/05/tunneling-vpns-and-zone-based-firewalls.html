title: Tunneling VPNs and Zone-Based Firewalls

<p>Arnold sent me an excellent question yesterday; he bought my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2006/11/deploying-zone-based-firewalls.html">Deploying Zone-Based Firewalls</a> book, but found no sample configurations using IPSec VPN. I was able to find a <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/vpndevc/ps5708/ps5710/ps1018/prod_white_paper0900aecd8062a909.html">few sample configurations on CCO</a>, but none of them included the <em>self </em>zone. The truly interesting bit of the puzzle is the traffic being received or sent by the router (everything else is self-explanatory if you’ve read my book), so those configurations are not of great help.</p>
<p>Realizing that this is a bigger can of worms than I’ve expected, I immediately fixed the slides in my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Choose_the_optimal_VPN_service"><em>Choose the Optimal VPN Service</em></a> webinar, which now includes the security models for GRE, VTI and DMVPN-based VPN services (you can <a href="http://choosevpn.eventbrite.com/">still register for the May 12th event</a>). </p>
<p class="note">These last-second changes were included in the downloadable PDF materials that the registered attendees can already get from our Webex site.</p>

<!--more--><p>Until I have time to develop and publish comprehensive (and tested) configurations, use these rules to develop your zone-to-self policies:</p>
<ul><li>You have to use access lists to classify traffic being sent or received by the router (you need access lists anyway, as the <strong>match protocol </strong>command cannot match ESP, GRE or OSPF).</li>
<li>You have to define two zone-pairs: self-to-zone and zone-to-self.</li>
<li>When using IPSec, the traffic to/from public IP infrastructure has to include <strong>esp</strong>, <strong>isakmp</strong> (UDP port 500) and <strong>non500-isakmp</strong>. ICMP and a few other things (for example, SSH to the router) are also highly advisable.</li>
<li>When using GRE tunnels without IPSec, the traffic to/from the router has to include <strong>gre</strong>.</li>
</ul>
