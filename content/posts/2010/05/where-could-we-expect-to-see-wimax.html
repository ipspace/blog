<p>In another <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/expert/Knowledgebase/0,289622,sid103,00.html"><em>Ask the Expert</em></a><em> </em>topic, I’m answering the question on <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/expert/KnowledgebaseAnswer/0,289625,sid103_gci1506629,00.html">expected Wimax deployment scenarios</a>. Although I personally believe <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/07/wimax-next-disruptive-technology.html">it’s a better technology than LTE</a> (and obviously I cannot comment on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_access_network">RAN</a> part of either), I don’t expect existing mobile operators to pick it up, as they’ve thrown too much money into the GSM/HSCSD/GPRS/EDGE/UMTS/HSDPA/HSUPA <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neverending_Story">neverending story</a>.</p>
