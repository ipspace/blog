<p>It took me even longer than usual to process the feedback from the <em><a href="http://choosevpn.eventbrite.com/">Choose the Optimal VPN Service</a> </em><a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Webinars">webinar</a>; all the things happening in May (from having numerous presentations to climbing my hardest route ever) left me mentally and physically exhausted. The webinar was great success and although we’ve covered nine VPN technologies in just over two hours, we’ve managed not to get lost ... and the Q&amp;A session at the end took almost 45 minutes, clearly a good indication that the students were engaged and wanted to understand all the intricate details. Here are two quotes from the participants:</p>
<blockquote class="cite"><p>Great session. Enjoyed the compare/contrast approach and feel that this approach gets to the critical issues most quickly.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">Bob Dixon</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">It was good. I can’t wait for the recordings and the configuration examples. I’d like a single session about DMVPN, it has a lot of tricks.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">Enrique Villa Crespo</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="info">Enrique’s wish is coming true; I’m already planning the “Advanced and Crazy DMVPN designs”.</p>
