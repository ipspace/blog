title: How widespread is IPv6 on mobile phones?

<p>We had great fun listening to Christian Gotare from Ericsson during the 3<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">rd</span> Slovenian IPv6 Summit (<a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgo6.si%2F3-slo-ipv6-summit%2F&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sl=sl&amp;tl=en">program description as translated by Google Translate</a>). He made numerous very strong statements about the (in)abilities of application programmers (<a href="https://vox.arnes.si/p31067724/?launcher=false&amp;fcsContent=true&amp;pbMode=normal">watch his presentation</a> ... it starts at approximately 0:42:00) and concluded his presentation with a live demo: he accessed Facebook through IPv6 from a Nokia phone running <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian_platform">Symbian</a>. </p>
<p>We all found the idea of an Ericsson guy doing demo with a Nokia phone hilarious and I thought he wanted to demonstrate that even Nokia could get it done ... until one of the Slovenian mobile operators described the problems theyâ€™re facing when trying to deploy IPv6 in their mobile network. <!--more-->According to his short update, only Nokia has reasonably priced mobile phones supporting IPv6. </p>
<p class="more">You will find an overview of challenges faced by Service Providers rolling out IPv6 in the <a href="http://spmarkettrends.eventbrite.com/"><em>Market Trends in Service Provider Networks</em></a> webinar. Core network design and implementation guidelines are described in the <a href="http://spipv6.eventbrite.com/"><em>Building IPv6 Service Provider Core</em></a> webinar.</p>
<p>I always thought that most mobile phones today support IPv6 (after all, the explosion of IP connectivity on smartphones is one of the primary reasons for IPv4 address exhaustion), but that seems not to be the case. <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/dvm105/blogs/ipv6/2010/05/ipv6-on-smartphones---its-happ.html">Android and iPhone OS 4.0 supposedly run IPv6</a> ... but <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=3389">only on WiFi</a>.</p>
<p>Can anyone share more information about other vendors in the comments? Thank you!</p>
