<p>In another interesting timing coincidence, the documentation for IOS-XR release 3.9.1 appeared at approximately the same time (probably a little bit later) as I started to research the viability of CGv6 during the preparation for my NAT64/DNS64 presentation.</p>
<p class="note">A kind guest has provided links to <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/crs/software/crs_r3.9.1/cg_nat/configuration/guide/cgc391book.html">configuration guide</a> and <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/crs/software/crs_r3.9.1/cg_nat/command/reference/cgr391book.html">command reference</a> in a <a href="/2010/05/cgv6-how-real-is-it/">comment to my blog post</a>. Thank you!</p>
<p>Looking at the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/crs/software/crs_r3.9.1/general/release/notes/reln_391crs.html">release notes</a>, the CGSE blade currently supports only CGN (large-scale NAT44), the interesting parts (NAT64 or DS-lite AFTR) are still in the pipeline.</p>
