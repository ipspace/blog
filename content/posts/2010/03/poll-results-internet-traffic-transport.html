<p>I was somewhat surprised by the results of my recent “<em>Do you use MPLS to transport Internet traffic?</em>” poll. I had assumed that most Service Provider networks today use MPLS-based BGP-free core, but <a href="http://polldaddy.com/community/poll/2912704/">almost half of the respondents transport Internet traffic natively</a>.</p>

<!--more--><div class="note"><p>Obviously you have to take the results with a grain of salt:</p>
<ul><li>We can’t be sure that all respondents are indeed Service Providers; most enterprise users obviously transport Internet traffic natively. </li>
<li>In a democratic poll like this one, an engineer operating a small network with a few routers (where you can have a small default-free part running BGP) and an engineer working with a huge global network get one vote each. </li>
<li>Last but not least, as <em>Bad designer </em>pointed out, the four options you had are not exclusive; if your network is large enough, you could use different mechanisms in different parts of your network.</li>
</ul>
