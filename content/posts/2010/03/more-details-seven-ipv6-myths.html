Obviously the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters">MythBusters</a> are not reading my blog and everyone else decided to focus on a single provocative sentence (got you!) and expressed strong feelings about NAT being (or not being) a security feature.</p>
<p>I've described the myths (including the mobility myth to get their number <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">up to the nearest magic number</a>) in more details in the <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid103_gci1420201,00.html">Seven IPv6 networking myths that don't match reality</a> article published by SearchTelecom.</p>
