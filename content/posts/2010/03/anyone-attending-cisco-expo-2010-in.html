<p>The local Cisco office sent me such a nice invitation to the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/SI/expo2010/index.html">Cisco Expo Slovenia</a> event that I simply had to register. So, if you’ll be in Portorož during the event and would like to join me for a cup of coffee or a beer (hopefully on a terrace overlooking the sea), <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Contact">get in touch</a> ... or look for the guy asking nasty questions from the back row ;) </p>
