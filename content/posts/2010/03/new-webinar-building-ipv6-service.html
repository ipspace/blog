<p>When building an IPv6-enabled Service Provider (or large enterprise) core, you have three design options: dual-stack deployment, running IPv6 over MPLS (6PE) or running IPv6 inside a VPN (6VPE). My new webinar, <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core"><em>Building IPv6 Service Provider core</em></a>, describes the principles of all three design options and their comparative benefits and drawbacks. It’s targeted at CCNP/CCIE-level engineers with basic IPv6 knowledge and includes detailed configuration examples and router printouts. After attending the webinar, you’ll get complete router configurations which you can use in your own lab to test the scenarios discussed in the webinar.</p>
