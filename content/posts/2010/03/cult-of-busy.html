<p>I love reading <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/">Scott Berkun’s blog</a>. For years I’ve been doing (and preaching) most of the things he writes about, but sometimes he manages to describe them so eloquently that the reading of familiar thoughts becomes pure pleasure. You simply must read the <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2010/the-cult-of-busy/"><em>Cult of Busy</em></a> post; I’ve seen too many people working 12+ hours a day and achieving nothing or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointy-Haired_Boss">pointy-haired bosses</a> who judged the productivity of their team solely by the time they left the office (and consequently managed to end with a heap of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_(Dilbert_character)">useless individuals</a>).</p>
