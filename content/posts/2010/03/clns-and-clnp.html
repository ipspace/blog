<p>Yap Chin Hoong has been looking at the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/IS-IS_in_OSI_protocol_stack">OSI protocol stack</a> I’ve published in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT3 wiki</a> and asked an interesting question: “where is CLNS in that protocol stack?”</p>
<p>The OSI protocol stack has a major advantage over the TCP/IP stack: it defines both the protocols and the APIs between the layers. CLNS (Connection-less network Service) is the API (the function calls that allow transport layers to exchange datagrams across the network) while CLNP (Connection-less network Protocol) is the layer-3 protocol that implements CLNS. In <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Image:OSI_Protocol_Stack.png">my diagram</a>, CLNS would be a thin line above CLNP between L3 and L4 boxes.</p>
<p class="note">IOS developers did not escape the confusion between CLNS and CLNP. The <strong>clns routing </strong>command does not make sense; you cannot route an API. The command should have been called <strong>clnp routing</strong>.</p>
