title: Can you help me fix the webinar marketing?

<p>The <em>Market trends in Service Provider networks </em>webinar was well received by the attendees... the “only” problem was that there were so few of them. The conversion ratios were murderous: </p>
<ul><li>From over a hundred thousand visitors who have seen the webinar announcement, approximately 1% clicked on the registration link. This is normal and expected; most people are banner-blind and many visitors are not interested in the particular topic or don’t want to attend a webinar.</li>
<li>Over a thousand visitors decided that the registration page is worth looking at, but only around 1% actually registered for the webinar. This ratio needs some serious fixing; increasing it by a few percentage points would make the whole idea viable. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you were among those that were interested enough in the webinar to look at the registration page but did not proceed, please tell me what stopped you from registering. And, obviously, if you’ve spotted a glaring stupidity I made, please share it with me. </p>
