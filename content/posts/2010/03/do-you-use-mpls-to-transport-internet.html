title: Do you use MPLS to transport Internet traffic?

<p>One of the interesting questions I’ve got after announcing the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core"><em>Building IPv6 Service Provider core</em></a> webinar was “<em>Why would you push IPv6 into the core?</em>” </p>
<p>Obviously there are two mechanisms to transport Internet traffic across your (next-generation ;) Service Provider core network: forward it natively or transport it between BGP next-hops across MPLS LSP. It would be really interesting to know how many people use one or the other mechanism, so if you’re working in a Service Provider environment, please respond to the poll (<a href="http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/2912704/">use this link if you’ve disabled JavaScript</a>).</p>
<script charset="utf-8" src="http://static.polldaddy.com/p/2912704.js" type="text/javascript"></script><p class="more">Both transport mechanisms are described in details in my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core"><em>Building IPv6 Service Provider core</em></a> webinar (<a href="http://spipv6.eventbrite.com/">don’t forget to register</a>). Conversely, if you’re still not sure why you should have an IP/MPLS backbone, the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Market_trends_in_Service_Provider_networks">Market trends in Service Provider networks</a> webinar will definitely persuade you (or your boss).</p>
