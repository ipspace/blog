The <b>snmp-server host</b> command in Cisco IOS has an interesting option: you can specify an URL as the destination host, for example: <b>snmp-server host http://1.2.3.4/xxx traps snmpv2c public</b>. However, I was not able to make it work; the router would accept the configuration command, but the outbound HTTP session never starts. Has anyone managed to get this to work? Any ideas what else is required?
