<p>The responses to the “<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/03/can-you-help-me-fix-webinar-marketing.html"><em>Can you help me fix the webinar marketing?</em></a><em>” </em>question were quite explicit: it’s too expensive for most people. Several readers indicated that they feel the optimal price would be around $50 (and some off-line respondents told me the original $90 price tag was too hard to expense). As Julian pointed out, “<em>the market is always right</em>”, so I’ve decided to reduce the price for the next webinars to $49.99, including the “<a href="http://choosevpn.eventbrite.com/"><em>Choose the optimal VPN service</em></a>” on May 11<sup>th</sup> and the “<a href="http://spmarkettrends.eventbrite.com/"><em>Market trends in Service Provider networks</em></a>” on June 2<sup>nd</sup>.</p>
<!--more--><p class="note">Obviously, the significantly reduced pricing means we need twice as many attendees to make the webinar financially viable. Let’s hope that the economists know what they talk about when describing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand">price elasticity of demand</a>.</p>
