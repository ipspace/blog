<p class="important"><strong>Update (2010-05-03):</strong> Cisco VPN Client 5.0.07 <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/vpn_client/cisco_vpn_client/vpn_client5007/release/notes/vpnclient5007.html">has been released</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of the supposed focus of my blog, its <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/01/most-visited-topics-in-2009.html">most popular post</a> still remains the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/08/cisco-vpn-client-in-64-bit-windows-7.html"><em>Cisco VPN client in 64-bit Windows 7</em></a>. This requirement is obviously so common that Cisco decided to implement the 64-bit client natively; it’s currently in beta testing. Philip Remaker left the following comment at my original post:</p>
