<p>In another close-to-perfect series of events, Scott Berkun has just <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2010/my-speech-at-the-economist/">published his latest speech on innovation</a> delivered at <a href="http://ideas.economist.com/">The Economists’ Ideas Economy</a> event. I loved this part (you might have noticed I’m following the <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/03/schneier_bloggi.html">Schneier Blogging Template</a>) ...</p>
<blockquote class="cite">You can put the word innovation on the back of a box, or in an advertisement, or even in the name of your company, but that does not make it so.  Words like radical, game-changing, breakthrough, and disruptive are similarly used to suggest something in lieu of actually being it. You can say innovative as many times as you want, but it won’t make you an innovator, nor make inventions, patents or profits magically appear in your hands.</blockquote>
<p>… but you should really take the time to read the whole article; it's a gem.</p>
<p>Any similarity to the recent <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/solutions/netsys/g2/index.html"><em>Innovation is Everywhere</em></a> event is obviously pure coincidence. If you don’t believe me, read some more <a href="http://www.michaelshermer.com/2008/09/folk-numeracy-middle-land/">statistics-based debunking</a> from the <a href="http://www.michaelshermer.com/">resident skeptic Michael Shermer</a>.</p>
