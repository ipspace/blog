<p>It’s pretty hard to sell something to people who haven’t realized they need it. My workshops and Cisco TelePresence are perfect examples. While I’m <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/03/can-you-help-me-fix-webinar-marketing.html">struggling to find the right approach</a>, infinitely more resourceful Cisco’s marketing created an ideal tool: the <a href="http://www.telepresencecalculator.com/">Cisco TelePresence Calculator</a>. </p>
<!--more--><p>After answering a few vague questions (with each answer spanning almost an order of magnitude), the magic oracle gives you a precise ROI period, the amount of carbon dioxide avoided (down to the fifth decimal) and the equivalent number of tree seedlings (accurate to at least 6 digits). No doubt the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointy-Haired_Boss">PHB</a> will be delighted; and since only a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert_(character)">lowly life form with a mundane engineering mindset</a> would dare to question the results, the sale is almost guaranteed.</p>
