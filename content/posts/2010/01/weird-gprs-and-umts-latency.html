title: Weird GPRS and UMTS latency

<p><em>Bad designer </em>wrote an interesting <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2010/01/wireless-generations.html">comment to my yesterday’s post</a>: 2G and 3G networks have huge latency issues. GPRS is intolerable, UMTS is awful and HSPDA is reasonable but still not what one would hope for. </p>
<p>The latency does not seem to be associated with serialization delay. UMTS gives you reasonable transfer rates and significant latency and GPRS gives you an order of magnitude higher latency than ISDN with comparable transfer rate. If anyone knows enough about the mobile technologies to explain this phenomenon (or at least give me useful pointers) I’d really appreciate your comments.</p>
