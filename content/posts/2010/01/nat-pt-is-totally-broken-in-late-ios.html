title: NAT-PT is totally broken in late IOS releases
url: /2010/01/nat-pt-is-totally-broken-in-late-ios.html
---

<p>When the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1752">current variant of IPv6 was selected 15 years ago</a>, seamless integration with IPv4 was a big deal, resulting in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2766">NAT-PT architecture</a>. NAT-PT tried to solve too many problems and (as I pointed out in my IPv6 Deployment workshop), while the 6to4 NAT is manageable, the 4to6 NAT is horrific (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful">NAT64</a> and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-behave-dns64">DNS64</a> are more reasonable; more about them in an upcoming post).</p>

<p class="more">NAT between IPv4 and IPv6 hosts is just one of the topics covered in the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Enterprise_IPv6_Deployment_Workshop"><em>Enterprise IPv6 Deployment</em> workshop</a>. You can attend an online version of the workshop or we can organize a dedicated event for your team.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ipv6/configuration/guide/ip6-nat_trnsln_ps6350_TSD_Products_Configuration_Guide_Chapter.html">NAT-PT implemented in Cisco IOS</a> is totally broken due to removal of <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/07/goodbye-fast-switching-cell-mode-mpls.html">fast switching support in IOS release 12.4(20)T</a> and <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ipswitch/configuration/guide/fast_swtchng_cnfg_ps6441_TSD_Products_Configuration_Guide_Chapter.html#wp1054617">numerous other releases</a>. As I wrote a year and a half ago, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/07/goodbye-fast-switching-cell-mode-mpls.html">removing fast switching will bite us eventually</a> … and so it does when you try to use NAT-PT.</p>

With fast switching gone, the punted packets land in a digital black hole. To make NAT-PT work, you have to disable IPv4 <em>and </em>IPv6 CEF <em>globally</em>. Do I need to spell out how that affects the router’s performance?</p>
