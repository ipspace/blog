<p><a href="http://etherealmind.com/">Greg Ferro</a> has republished an older post in which he <a href="http://etherealmind.com/blessay-cloud-computing-like-public-transport/">compares Cloud Computing with public transport</a> (and notes that nothing has changed in more than a year since he wrote the original article). His analogy is more than fitting; a perfect example is <a href="http://googledocs.blogspot.com/2010/01/upload-and-store-your-files-in-cloud.html">Google’s new Google Docs offering</a>, where Stephen Foskett did a <a href="http://blog.fosketts.net/2010/01/12/gdrive-finally-launched/">nice cost analysis of the unsupported service as compared to supported one</a>. </p>
<p class="more">I’m describing aspects of cloud computing in its various incarnations in my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Next-generation_IP_services">Next-generation IP Services</a> workshop. You can attend an online version of the workshop or we can organize a dedicated event for your team.</p>
<p>Translated into public transport terms: if you want to fly cheap, choose Ryan Air (in Google’s case, you pay <a href="http://googledocs.blogspot.com/2010/01/upload-and-store-your-files-in-cloud.html">25 cents per gigabyte per year</a>); if you want reasonable support and flexibility, use Lufthansa (<a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2010/01/store-and-share-files-in-cloud-with.html">$3.50 per gigabyte per year for Google Apps Premier Edition customers</a> or 14 times more than the unsupported capacity).</p>
<p class="note">If you’re unhappy with my choice of airlines, insert your own selection in the above paragraph ;)</p>
