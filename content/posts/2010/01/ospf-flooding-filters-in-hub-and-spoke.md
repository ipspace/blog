Almost all articles describing large-scale DMVPN in combination with OSPF use the “magic” **ip ospf database-filter all out** command on the hub routers to minimize the OSPF traffic traversing the DMVPN part of the network.

NOTE: The same trick can be used in any hub-and-spoke network, including P2MP Carrier Ethernet networks.

What these articles usually fail to tell you is the true impact of this command: it stops all OSPF flooding from hub router. The spoke routers receive no OSPF information whatsoever; to establish connectivity to the network core, you have to use static default routes on the spoke routers.

I’ve described the details of OSPF flooding filters and their use in hub-and-spoke networks in the “[OSPF flooding filters in hub-and-spoke environment](http://wiki.nil.com/OSPF_flooding_filters_in_hub-and-spoke_environment)” article in the [CT3 wiki](http://wiki.nil.com/).
