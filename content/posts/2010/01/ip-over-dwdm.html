<p>A while ago I was pushed (actually it was a kind nudge) into another interesting technology area: optical networks, with emphasis on IP over DWDM. I realized almost immediately that Iâ€™d encountered another huge can of worms. A few issues you can stumble across when trying to plug routers or switches directly into DWDM networks are documented in my <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid103_gci1379011,00.html"><em>IP over dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM): Metro and core issues</em></a> article recently published by <a href="http://www.searchtelecom.com/">SearchTelecom.com</a>.</p>
