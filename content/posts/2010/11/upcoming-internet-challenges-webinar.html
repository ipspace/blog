<p>Last spring I <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2010/06/upcoming-internet-challenges.html">prepared an “<em>Upcoming Internet Challenges</em>” presentation for Slovenian CCIE club</a> based on my blog posts about not-so-well-known challenges Internet is facing in the next few years (the presentation is also <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/IOSHints/upcoming-internet-challenges">available on SlideShare</a>). </p>
<p>A few weeks ago one of the regular attendees of my webinars sent me an e-mail saying “<em>Which webinar covers this topic? It seems extremely interesting and I would like to hear from you directly.</em>” So here it is: the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/InternetChallenges"><em>Upcoming Internet Challenges</em></a><em> </em>webinar. It will be a one-time event, so make sure you <a href="http://nginternet.eventbrite.com/">register for it</a> if you’re interested in this topic (the recording will also be available as part of the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Subscription">yearly subscription package</a>). </p>
