<p>We were implementing MPLS/VPN building block in our <a href="http://www.nil.com/go/customers">customers’ enterprise networks</a> for almost a decade, often using Multi-VRF (the solution formerly known as VRF-Lite) and sometimes implementing full-blown private MPLS/VPN networks (including private MPLS/VPN with IPsec over two MPLS/VPN service provider networks). </p>
<p>I always considered enterprise MPLS/VPN to be an equivalent of enterprise BGP: rare, but not so hard to grasp once you decide you need it. The <a href="http://etherealmind.com/packet-pushers-show-7-enterprise-mpls/">MPLS/VPN Packet Pushers podcast</a> was an eye opener: MPLS/VPN seems to be more complex than I thought. Let’s fix that: if you think your enterprise network could use MPLS/VPN, you’ll get a solid foundation in my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/EnterpriseMPLS">Enterprise MPLS/VPN Deployment</a> webinar (<a href="http://mpls.eventbrite.com/">register here</a>).</p>
<!--more--><p>Obviously I can’t promise to do miracles; the webinar is only two hours long and getting <a href="http://www.nil.com/ls/mpls">an overview of MPLS/VPN</a> takes a week. I’ll go deep on Multi-VRF (including VRF-aware DHCP, inter-VRF NAT and packet and route leaking) as it’s applicable to most enterprise environments and not well covered in existing courses. The second half of the webinar covers MPLS/VPN technologies, including route targets, route distinguishers, VPNv4 addresses, MP-BGP and MPLS labeling. The technology overview and sample configurations will give you an insight into how MPLS works and what’s waiting for you if you decide to implement full-blown MPLS/VPN in your network ... and that’s all I can cram into the limited time.</p>
<p class="note"><a href="http://tools.cisco.com/GlobalLearningLocator/courseDetails.do?actionType=executeCourseDetail&amp;courseID=4966">Implementing Cisco MPLS</a> is a baseline MPLS course. Many advanced topics (including split route reflector design and hub-and-spoke VPN) that I’ve put in the first release of the course (part of the original CCIP curriculum) have gradually disappeared. If you need them, consider attending something like our <a href="http://www.nil.com/ls/AMPLS"><em>Advanced Implementing and Troubleshooting MPLS VPN Networks</em></a> course.</p>
<p>Last but definitely not least, I’m uploading new drafts of the material to my Webinar Management System every week and you can <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2010/11/early-access-to-webinar-recordings.html">access them immediately after registration</a>. You could even tell me that you’d absolutely love to see a particular case covered in the webinar.</p>
