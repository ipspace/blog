<p>Before someone accuses me of being totally FCoE/DCB-focused, here’s an interesting EEM trick. Damian <a href="#comments">wanted to have time-dependent static routes</a> (you could use them to ensure expensive backup path is only established during the working hours). I told him to use cron with EEM to modify router configuration (and obviously lost him in the acronym forest)... but there’s an even better solution: use reliable static routing and modify just the track object’s state with EEM.</p>
<!--more--><p>Static route first: we’ll create a floating default route (we’re solving the backup path problem) tied to a track object.</p>
<pre class="code">ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 Tunnel 0 250 track 42</pre><p>Next, we have to create the <strong>track </strong>object itself. We’ll create a <strong>stub-object</strong> since it won’t track an IP SLA or interface state; we just need a flag that we’ll set with EEM. We also have to decide what happens after a router reload. It might be a good idea to have the backup path available, so the default state of the track object should be <strong>up</strong>.</p>
<pre class="code">track 42 stub-object<br/> default-state up</pre><p>Last step: create two EEM applets. One of them will set the track object’s state to <em>down </em>at the end of the business day, the other one will set it to <em>up </em>in the morning.</p>
<pre class="code">event manager applet DisableBackup<br/> event timer cron name DisableBackup cron-entry "0 17 * * *"<br/> action 1.0 track set 42 state down<br/>!<br/>event manager applet EnableBackup<br/> event timer cron name EnableBackup cron-entry "0 8 * * 1-5"<br/> action 1.0 track set 42 state up</pre><p>You might wonder why you should use this slightly convoluted solution when you could simply modify the router configuration in EEM applets. The answer is simple: if your EEM applets are modifying the configuration, you never know whether you should save configuration changes before reloading the router ... and if you use a configuration monitoring tool, you might get lots of unnecessary alerts. </p>

<p>Obviously I was “a bit” upset about getting the same question too many times last year, so I wrote the <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2009/03/time-based-ios-actions.html">Time-based IOS actions</a> post ... and <a href="#wp1157622">here’s the official reference for the event timer command</a>.</p>
