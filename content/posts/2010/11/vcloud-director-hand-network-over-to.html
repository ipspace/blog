title: 'vCloud Director: hand the network over to server admins'

<p>A few months ago VMware decided to kick away one of the more stubborn obstacles in their way to Data Center domination: the networking team. Their vCloud architecture implements VLANs, NAT, firewalls and a bit of IP routing within the VMware hypervisor and add-on modules ... and just to make sure the networking team has no chance of interfering, they implemented MAC-in-MAC encapsulation, making their cloudy dreamworld totally invisible to the lowly net admins.</p>
<!--more--><p>After you vent your initial rage at the stupidity of another unnecessary (politically-induced) layer in your Data Center, try to find the silver lining: if the server admins are brave enough to implement VMware vCloud Director Network Isolation technology (VCDNI, the MAC-in-MAC encapsulation), the networking infrastructure becomes exceedingly simple. Once TRILL, FabricPath or 802.1aq become reality, building a huge Data Center network is a piece of cake.</p>
<p>However, someone will still have to cope with all the complexities of load balancing, firewalling, NATs, VLANs etc; just make sure your CIO (and everyone else involved) is well aware that the server team is now responsible for everything beyond point-to-point layer-2 transport.</p>
