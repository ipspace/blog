<p>A while ago, <a href="http://packetpushers.net/show-18-the-pushers-answer-your-questions/">Packet Pushers did a Q&amp;A podcast</a> (or was it <a href="http://packetpushers.net/ppp-show-23-love-the-love-questions/">this one</a> ... they’re all great) and one of the questions was “should I buy MPLS/VPN or VPLS service?” Greg’s response was along the lines of “Ivan would be the right one to answer this question” and as my regular readers and attendees of my webinars know, you can get a very comprehensive version of the answer in my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Choose_the_optimal_VPN_service"><em>Choose the optimal VPN service</em></a> webinar (<a href="http://choosevpn.eventbrite.com/">register here</a> or <a href="http://choosevpn.eventbrite.com/">buy a recording</a>). </p>
<p>You’ll find a somewhat shorter answer in the <a href="http://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/tutorial/Classes-of-MPLS-services-Find-the-best-MPLS-VPN-service-for-your-WAN"><em>Find the best MPLS/VPN </em><em>service for your WAN</em></a><em> </em>tutorial I wrote for <a href="http://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/">SearchEnterpriseWAN.com</a>. </p>
