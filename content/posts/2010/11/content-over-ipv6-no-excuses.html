<p>Yesterday I spent the whole day at another fantastic <a href="http://go6.si/4-slo-ipv6-summit-2324-nov/eng-version-4th-slo-ipv6-summit/">IPv6 Summit</a> organized by Jan Žorž of the <a href="http://go6.si/">go6 institute</a>. He managed to get two networking legends: <a href="http://se.linkedin.com/in/patrikhson">Patrik Fältström</a> (he was, among numerous other things, a member of Internet Architecture Board) had the <a href="https://vox.arnes.si/p96975242/">keynote speech</a> (starts @ 11:40) and <a href="http://labs.ripe.net/Members/dfk">Daniel Karrenberg</a> (of the RIPE fame) was chairing the <a href="https://vox.arnes.si/p29653243/">technical panel discussion</a>. My small contribution was a <a href="https://vox.arnes.si/p35948139/">half-hour talk on the importance of IPv6-enabled content</a> (starts @ 37:00).</p>
<!--more--><p><strong>Short summary of my presentation</strong>: mobile operators are moving to IPv6 and they don’t care if your IPv4 content is left behind as long as their teen customers can get to YouTube and Facebook, so it’s time to get your act together. </p>
<p>Some people <a href="http://www.twitter.com/lowk3y/status/7381440962498560">found it interesting</a> (Daniel said it was the only presentation in Slovenian he managed to understand; try if you're as good as he is ;) and you can <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/IOSHints/content-over-ipv6-no-excuses">view the slides on SlideShare</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://vox.arnes.si/p29653243/">technical panel</a> was also great fun. I simply had to mention some of my old grudges, including the <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/search?q=DHCPv6">interesting twists you have to use to make DHCPv6 work</a> (one of the topics of my upcoming <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core">IPv6 webinar</a> – <a href="http://spipv6.eventbrite.com/">register here</a>). After we’d been discussing the obvious topics Jan Bervar (our top security CCIE) simply had to provoke everyone with a NAT66 question ... and we found some more meat to chew on that old bone until <a href="http://www.twitter.com/lowk3y/status/7458794682454016">Jan Žorž reminded us that NAT66 is the only thing standing between us and a beer</a>.</p>
