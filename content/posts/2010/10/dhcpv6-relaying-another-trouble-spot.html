<p>My <a href="/2010/10/dhcpv6-over-pppoe-total-disaster.html">DHCPv6+PPPoE post</a> received a very comprehensive comment from Ole Troan (thank you!) in which he explains the context in which DHCPv6 was developed (a mechanism to give a static IPv6 prefix to a customer) and its intended usage (as the prefix is static, it should have a very long lifetime).</p>
<p>However, when you deploy DHCPv6 in some modern access networks (it’s not just PPPoE, Carrier Ethernet fares no better), you might experience subtle problems. Let’s start with a step-by-step description of how DHCPv6 works:</p>
<!--more--><ul class="ListParagraph"><li>CPE router reboots. IPv6 is configured on the outside interface. We can use link-local address or SLAAC (in which case two IPv6 prefixes are consumed per customer).</li>
<li>CPE router sends DHCPv6 request toward the PE-router. The DHCPv6 request includes the IA_PD option.</li>
<li>PE-router receives the DHCPv6 request and either allocates the requested IPv6 prefix from a local pool (in which case the prefix is dynamic and somewhat random) or forwards the DHCPv6 request to a central DHCPv6 server (DHCPv6 relay functionality).</li>
<li>In both cases, as the DHCPv6 reply goes back through the PE-router, the PE-router installs a static IPv6 route to the delegated IPv6 prefix. The next-hop is obviously the CPE router requesting the prefix.</li>
</ul>
<p class="warn">My PE-router running IOS release 15.0(1)M did not insert the required static route when working as a DHCPv6 relay. DHCPv6 server functionality worked as expected.</p>
<p>So far, so good. Now imagine the PE-router reloads or its access Ethernet interface flaps. The PE-router loses all static routes to the CPE routers that were inserted in the IPv6 routing table based on DHCPv6 replies. However, the CPE routers assume everything is OK (in a typical mixed L2/L3 access network like the one shown below, a problem on one side does not result in a link loss on the other side) and try to renew the delegated prefix’s lease only when it’s about to expire. In the meantime, the customer has no IPv6 connectivity.</p>

<p>Fortunately, DHCPv6 implementation in Cisco IOS is pretty smart. When you use a local IPv6 pool on the PE-router, the PE-router rebuilds the static routes from the local DHCPv6 bindings. If you use a local pool and store DHCP bindings in a database, they would survive router reload as well. </p>
<p class="info">It’s highly recommended to use <strong>ipv6 dhcp database </strong>to store the delegated prefixes.</p>
<p>But what if you decide to use a central DHCPv6 server and DHCPv6 relaying on the PE-router? How would that combination survive a link loss or a router reload? What am I missing?</p>
<p class="update">Update 2012-01-19: DHCP Bulk Lease, available in Cisco IOS release 15.1(S) solves the state loss in DHCPv6 relays.</p>
