<p>Brad sent me an interesting DCI encryption question a while ago. Our discussion started with:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">We have a pair of 10GbE links between our data centers. We talked to a hardware encryption vendor who told us our L3 EIGRP DCI could not be used and we would have to convert it to a pure Layer 2 link. This doesn't make sense to me as our hand-off into the carrier network is 10GbE; couldn't we just insert the Ethernet encryptor as a "transparent" device connected to our routed port ?</blockquote>
<p>The whole thing obviously started as a layering confusion. Brad is routing traffic between his data centers (the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/09/long-distance-vmotion-and-traffic.html">long-distance vMotion</a> demon hasn’t visited his server admins yet), so he’s talking about L3 DCI. </p>
<p>The encryptor vendor has a different perspective and sent him the following requirements:</p>
<!--more--><ol class="ListParagraph"><li>MAC address MUST be preserved.</li>
<li>The network between encryptors cannot modify the Ethernet MAC addresses. </li>
<li>Transmission order MUST be preserved:</li>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>QOS MUST occur outside of encryptors, not between encryptors. QOS may reorder frames.</li>
<li>L2 MPLS VPN - the MPLS control word MUST be enabled to guarantee transmission order.</li>
<li>L2 payload SHALL NOT be looked into by network between encryptors.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>Their hardware is clearly using a proprietary encryption technology that looks like bump-in-the-wire at layer-2, so they can only work over L2 VPN offered by a Service Provider (VPLS or pseudowire). Fortunately, Brad is actually buying a L2 VPN (over which he runs L3 with EIGRP), so everything worked out just fine.</p>
<h4>Lessons learned</h4><ol class="ListParagraph"><li>When you buy standalone encryption devices, check whether they support IPSec or not.</li>
<li>If the encryption device does not support IPSec, it might work as a layer-3 device (router) or as a layer-2 device (bump-in-the-wire).</li>
<li>In both cases, using MPLS/VPN services from the service provider could be questionable, as you need to run PE-CE routing protocol across the encryption device.</li>
<li>It’s easiest to combine external encryptors with layer-2 VPN services (VPLS, pseudowire) or dark fiber, regardless of whether you run L2 or L3 transport across the link.</li>
<li>Even when the encryption vendor claims its device is a bump-in-the-wire, check whether it supports point-to-point or any-to-any encrypted sessions. If it’s a point-to-point device, it’s best used over a pseudowire.</li>
</ol>

It also explains how each services looks from the enterprise network perspective and how it’s best used.</p>
