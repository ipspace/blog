<p><strong>Short summary:</strong> The <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/DMVPN">DMVPN webinar</a> (<a href="http://dmvpn.eventbrite.com/">register here</a>) now includes detailed EIGRP and BGP configurations guidelines and sample configurations as well as in-depth description of Phase 2 / Phase 3 behavior and scalability guidelines. I also made sure you don’t need any prior DMVPN knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Tangential thought</strong>: B stands for Basics, S for Scalability. Any other interpretation is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>And here’s the long story ...</p>
<!--more--><p>As I was designing the DMVPN webinar more than half a year ago, I wanted to focus on interesting concepts, as I assumed baseline DMVPN technology was well understood and widely known. It turned out that’s not the case and most of the students really appreciated step-by-step journey from hub-and-spoke Phase 1 DMVPN to scalable Phase 3 DMVPN ... it seems that simply due to my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/04/big-picture-and-my-webinars-with-vpls.html">obsession with the big picture approach</a> I’ve created something that can give an engineer fluent in IP routing and familiar with IPSec basics in-depth understanding of DMVPN. There were just a few missing bits-and-pieces.</p>
<p>To make sure I’m covering all the angles, I’m adding EIGRP- and BGP-related material to the webinar (so far, all the examples were based on OSPF). I will also add a few troubleshooting tips (including some of the hard-learned lessons from the DMVPN workshop I did in early October), in-depth explanation of how Phase 2 shortcuts work and more explicit scalability guidelines.</p>
<p>With the addition of all this new material, something obviously had to go. I decided to remove the encryption offload section; it will still be available as a separate PDF document and you’ll be able to watch older recordings, but it will no longer be a part of the online webinar.</p>
<p>Last but definitely not least: past attendees of the DMVPN webinars will get access to the new material automatically. You’ll get a notification e-mail a few days after the November session.</p>
