<p>Ethan Banks is <a href="http://packetattack.wordpress.com/2010/09/26/going-independent-or-not-aggregating-the-wisdom-of-crowds/">continuing his deliberations on going independent</a> (or not). He’s definitely collected some very interesting feedback.</p>
<p>Stephen Foskett shared a link to an interesting blog post: “<a href="http://ursusrex.com/2010/09/26/how-to-pitch-a-tech-blogger/">How to Pitch A Tech Blogger</a>”. A must read for vendors attending Tech Field Day (have you noticed there is no mention of Gartner or IDC? ;)</p>
<p>Another great read from Stephen: a large dose of common sense hidden under the “<a href="http://blog.fosketts.net/2010/09/24/fundamental-practices-enterprise/">Four Fundamental Best Practices for Enterprise IT</a>” title. I wonder if the vendors touting TRILL and <a href="/2010/09/long-distance-vmotion-and-traffic.html">inter-DC bridging with long-distance vMotion</a> ever got to the “Minimize Complexity” part, let alone “Align Expectations with Reality”.</p>
<p>The “<a href="http://www.rationalsurvivability.com/blog/?p=2679">Hack The Stack Or Go On a Bender With a Vendor</a>” tackles the age-old dilemma: build or buy, as it applies to the cloudy environments.</p>
<p>Brad Hedlund continues his series of great UCS posts with the explanation of <a href="http://bradhedlund.com/2010/09/23/cisco-ucs-fabric-failover/">UCS Fabric Failover</a> feature.</p>
<p>Jeremy Gaddis documented his impressions of the Net Field Day 2010 event:<a href="http://evilrouters.net/2010/09/27/net-field-day-%E2%80%93-intro-and-day-1/"> day 1</a> and <a href="http://evilrouters.net/2010/09/28/net-field-day-day-2/">day 2</a>. If you’ve missed NFD-related posts, Stephen Foskett makes sure you’re able to read them all via his <a href="http://gestaltit.com/field-day/2010-net/net-field-day-2010-links/">Net Field Day 2010 Links</a> page.</p>
