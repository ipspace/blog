<p>Iâ€™ve added several new topics to the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/DataCenterIntro">Data Center 3.0 for Networking Engineers</a> webinar (<a href="http://datacenter20.eventbrite.com/">register here</a> or <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Recordings">buy a recording</a>), making it a 100+ slides behemoth:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><strong>Anycast</strong> in the load-balancing section (which also covers DNS-based load balancing, dedicated load balancers, Microsoft NLB and application-specific solutions).</li>
<li><strong>More details on multi-chassis link aggregation and VSS/vPC architecture </strong>in the LAN reference architecture section (other topics in the same section: port extenders and large-scale bridging, including TRILL, 802.1aq and FabricPath).</li>
<li><strong>Multihop FCoE and FIP snooping </strong>in the storage protocols section (other protocols described in this section: SCSI, FC, FCoE, iSCSI and DCB).</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, the attendees of the previous Data Center webinars will get access to the new recording and the new PDF materials.</p>
