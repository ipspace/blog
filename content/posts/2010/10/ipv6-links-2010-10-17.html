<p>IPv6 is becoming a mainstream topic ... here are a few interesting articles from the last weeks:</p>
<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/09/there-is-no-plan-b-why-the-ipv4-to-ipv6-transition-will-be-ugly.ars">There is no Plan B: why the IPv4-to-IPv6 transition will be ugly</a> – explains why we are forced to go to IPv6, whether we like it or not.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9186703/Akamai_Why_our_IPv6_upgrade_is_harder_than_Google_s?taxonomyId=16&amp;pageNumber=1">Akamai: Why our IPv6 upgrade is harder than Google's</a> – this is what happens when you’re caught asleep at the wheel. All you can do is yammer how your service is more complex than that of your competitors ... if I would be a customer, I would be worried and starting to look elsewhere.</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.ripe.net/Members/franz/content-untunneling-ipv6">Untunneling IPv6</a> – looks like we’re finally getting rid of IPv6 tunnels. We’re down to 10% ... just a bit more and it will become safe to have A and AAAA records for the same web hosts.</p>
<p>It’s bad enough when people in blogosphere claim IPv6 is safer than IPv4 and that it will enable better DRM because hosts are not hidden behind NAT. When the <a href="http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2010/09/kundra-ipv6-memo.html">US federal government gets on the same bandwagon, it’s worrying</a>.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, when you get past the <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2010/03/more-details-seven-ipv6-myths.html">myths</a> and accept that IPv6 is not more secure than IPv4, there’s a <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-119/draft-sp800-119_feb2010.pdf">great NIST publication to help you get started</a>.</p>
<p>Last but definitely not least, for all those that think SHIM, HIP, ILNP, LISP ... will save the Internet, Job Snijders has published a great <a href="http://blog.snijders-it.nl/2010/10/location-separation-protocol-checklist.html">get-back-to-earth reality-checklist</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and I simply have to mention that the next session of my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core"><em>Building IPv6 Service Provider Core</em></a> webinar is in <a href="http://spipv6.eventbrite.com/">mid-December</a>.</p>
