<p>A medley of virtualization/access network links:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.definethecloud.net/?p=496">Access layer virtualization: VN-Tag and VEPA</a>. A nice summary of what Cisco and HP are trying to sell us as VN-Tag and VEPA. The truth might be a bit different (definitely not <a href="http://www.definethecloud.net/?page_id=235">Joe</a>’s fault).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mseanmcgee.com/2010/09/cisco-ucs-b-series-server-network-adapter-options-overview/">UCS Network Adapter Options Overview</a>. A nice summary of three NIC architectures with  a reasonable answer to the question: “why would I need virtual NICs in my server?” applicable to a generic Data Center environment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mseanmcgee.com/2010/09/great-minds-think-alike-%E2%80%93-cisco-and-vmware-agree-on-sharing-vs-limiting/">Great Minds Think Alike – Cisco and VMware Agree On Sharing vs. Limiting</a>. Another fantastic introductory QoS post. It looks like we have to repeat the “rate-limiting is bad, queuing is good” mantra ad nauseam hoping everyone eventually gets it. Bonus: people addicted to GUI might finally get it due to the illustrative highway analogies.</p>
<p>Speaking of illustrative, Brad Hedlund published a huge <a href="http://bradhedlund.com/2010/09/15/vmware-10ge-qos-designs-cisco-ucs-nexus/">VMware 10GE QoS Design Deep Dive with Cisco UCS, Nexus</a> article (no, I haven’t read it all yet ... my flight home from <a href="#search?q=%23TechFieldDay">#TechFieldDay</a> took only 11 hours). </p>
