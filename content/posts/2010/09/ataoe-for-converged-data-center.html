title: ATAoE for converged Data Center networks? No way

<p>When I started writing about storage industry and its attempts to tweak Ethernet to its needs, someone mentioned ATAoE. I read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATA_over_Ethernet">ATAoE Wikipedia article</a> and concluded that this dinky technology probably makes sense in a small home office ... and then I’ve stumbled across an <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/08/10/coraid_esg/">article in The Register that claimed you could run a 9000-user Exchange server on ATAoE storage</a>. It was time to deep-dive into this “interesting” L2+7 protocol. As expected, there are numerous good reasons you won’t hear about ATAoE in my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/DC30">Data Center 3.0 for Networking Engineers</a> webinar and I described a few of them in a <a href="http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/generic/0,295582,sid7_gci1520299,00.html">blog post I wrote to SearchNetworking’s Fast Packet blog</a>.</p>
