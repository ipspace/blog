<p>The attendees of my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core">Building IPv6 Service Provider Core</a> webinar get several sets of complete router configurations for a six router lab that emulates a typical Service Provider network with a residential customer and an enterprise BGP customer. The configurations can be used on any hardware (real or otherwise) supporting recent Cisco IOS software, allowing you to test and modify the design scenarios discussed in the webinar.</p>
