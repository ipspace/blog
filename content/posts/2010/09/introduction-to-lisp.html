<p>I’ve been mentioning LISP several times during the last months. It seems to be the only viable solution to the global IP routing table explosion. All other proposals require modifying layers above IP and while that’s where the problem should have been solved, <a href="/2010/07/tcpip-is-like-mainframe-you-cant-change.html">expecting those layers to change any time soon</a> is like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_Godot">waiting for Godot</a>.</p>
