Every Internet-related post is a great opportunity to increase comment count. I'll pass this time, here are the articles I found interesting with little or no comments from my side. First the generic Internet:

-   [IPv6 and Transitional Myths](http://www.circleid.com/posts/ipv6_and_transitional_myths/) -- Great mythbuster by Geoff Huston
-   [Google IPv6 statistics](http://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics/)

And then my favorite controversy:

-   [Net Neutrality for Dummies](http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/58254)
-   [Network Neutrality: Pretty Much Just Socialism](http://siliconangle.com/blog/2010/08/24/network-neutrality-pretty-much-just-socialism/) (I'm obviously not the only one claiming that)
-   [ISP\'s top data hog gobbles 2.7TB of data in a month](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/08/isps-top-data-hog-gobbles-27tb-of-data-in-a-month.ars) -- a bit old but still relevant
-   [Congress Needs to Step In for Net Neutrality\...Really? Seriously?](http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/65331)
-   [Mobile Carriers Dream of Charging per Page](http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/12/carriers-net-neutrality-tiers/)
