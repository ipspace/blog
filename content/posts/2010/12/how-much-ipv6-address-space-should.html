<p>A while ago I wrote about <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/11/ipv6-addressing-how-wrong-can-you-get.html">IPv6 addressing challenges some ISPs face</a> and recommended what I thought was agreed-upon practice of giving residential customers a /64 or a /56. Not long after, I received an e-mail from an IPv6 guru saying:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">[Worse] is when people start claiming to have expertise in IPv6 and promulgate this idea of residential /56s and /64s as immutable fact. The reality is that it is becoming more and more apparent that /56s and especially /64s to residential customers are going to be harmful to future innovation in IPv6.</blockquote>
<!--more--><p>I can’t possibly track all the emerging technologies in the world and I am delighted when people point out my weak spots (as Petr Lapukhov, Dmitri Kalintsev and a few others are doing on a regular basis) as that’s a wonderful opportunity to learn something new, so I asked about the reasons why someone might want to give a residential user a /48 ... and never got a reply.</p>
<p>Still perplexed, I asked the same question at the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/11/content-over-ipv6-no-excuses.html">Slovenian IPv6 summit’s roundtable</a> with <a href="http://labs.ripe.net/Members/dfk">Daniel Karrenberg</a> and <a href="http://se.linkedin.com/in/patrikhson">Patrik Fältström</a> ... and figured out that while it’s still quite possible I’m totally ignorant, at least I'm in a very respectable company.</p>
<p>As I’m running another session of the <em><a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core">Building IPv6 Service Provider Core</a></em> webinar next week (<a href="http://spipv6.eventbrite.com/">register here</a> or <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Recordings">buy a recording</a>) and it includes a short section on IPv6 addressing best practices, please help me out: if you think there are good reasons to give residential users /48s, write a comment.</p>
