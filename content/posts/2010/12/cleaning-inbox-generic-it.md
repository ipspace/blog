Last gems found in dusty corners of my cluttered Inbox:

-   The Myths of IT -- [Part 1](http://networktherapy.wordpress.com/2010/12/07/the-myths-of-it-part-1/) and [Part 2](http://networktherapy.wordpress.com/2010/12/08/the-myths-of-it-part-2/). A must-read for anyone working in the IT industry.
-   [Phone](http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/phone/) - Scott Adams (of the Dilbert fame) ranting about smartphones. Priceless.
-   [Maybe you only need it because you have it](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/12/07/cascading-needs/) -- seen it too many times. Might also apply to long-distance vMotion.
