title: Remote access section added to the IPv6 service provider webinar
url: /2010/12/remote-access-section-added-to-ipv6.html
---

<p>Due to extreme student interest, I’ve added a whole new remote access section to my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core"><em>Building IPv6 Service Provider Core</em></a><em> </em>webinar (<a href="http://spipv6.eventbrite.com/">register here</a> or <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Recordings">buy a recording</a>). It covers PPPoE and Carrier Ethernet access methods (PPPoE configuration can be used in any dial-up environment; Carrier Ethernet configuration is probably applicable to cable as well) and describes the following topics:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>SLAAC on access networks for hosts connecting to the IPv6 Internet;</li>
<li>DHCPv6 prefix delegation required by IPv6-enabled CPE routers;</li>
<li>Prefix allocation (SLAAC and DHCPv6) from local pools;</li>
<li>DHCPv6 relays and SLAAC/DHCPv6-RADIUS integration.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, attendees of past webinars can download the updated materials immediately and will get access to the new recording after the next week’s session.</p>
