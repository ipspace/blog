<p>GigaOm published two interesting articles by Joe Weinman: in the first one, he describes <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/12/11/is-pay-per-use-for-broadband-inevitable/">why pay-per-use residential broadband Internet is probably inevitable</a>, in the second one he <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/12/12/predictions-2011-if-pay-per-use-comes-to-broadband-then-what/">predicts changes in user behavior if the service providers decide to implement it</a>. I would also suggest you take time and read his <a href="http://www.joeweinman.com/Resources/Joe_Weinman_The_Market_For_Melons.pdf">in-depth Market for Melons article</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously, collecting money costs money and the pay-per-use model is no exception (not to mention that most people would pay less), so the service providers prefer usage caps. There are numerous ways to implement usage caps, but <a href="http://www.metrocast.com/policy_HSI_AUP.cfm">implementing usage cap as an acceptable use policy and calling exceeding the cap policy violation</a> is not the way to do it. Some people are truly trying to alienate the users.</p>
<!--more--><p>Last but definitely not least, the Comcast/L3 saga continues, with <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/10/12/14/1335235/Comcast-Accused-of-Congestion-By-Choice">leaks documenting saturated upstream links</a> and <a href="http://blog.comcast.com/2010/12/comcasts-responds-to-level-3s-fcc-filing.html">Level3 trying to apply all sorts of legal pressures on Comcast</a>. Enjoy the show!</p>
