title: Yearly webinar subscription – interesting questions

<p>I received several questions about my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Subscription"><em>yearly </em><em>webinar </em><em>subscription</em></a><em> </em>package. It started with a CCIE who was interested in buying it:</p>
<p><strong>I just wanted to clarify</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> if I buy the yearly subscriptions I have access to 3 up and coming webinars </strong><strong><em>PLUS</em></strong><strong> all</strong><strong> the archived material you have</strong><strong>? </strong>That’s absolutely correct. <del class="wrong">Even more, if you decide you’d like to attend more than three live webinars in the 12 months after buying the subscription, you’ll get a 30% discount on all subsequent ones</del> <ins class="corr">But even better (the terms have changed in the meantime), you get unlimited access to all live webinar sessions for the duration of your subscription.</ins></p>
<p><strong>Do you have a list of what is available in the archive material?</strong> Of course. You can view the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Subscription/Recordings">list of all recordings</a> (multiple recordings are available for some of the sessions) and the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Subscription/Materials">list of all PDF documents and router configuration sets</a>.</p>
<!--more--><p>Another engineer that attended numerous webinars in the past sent me a more cautious one (proving yet again that <a href="#comments"><em>subscription </em>might not be the best word to use</a>): </p>
<p><strong>Would w</strong><strong>e still have access to material</strong><strong>/recording</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> from this year webinars starting from January 1</strong><span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;"><strong>st</strong></span><strong> 201</strong><strong>1?</strong> Yes. The introduction of yearly subscription package does not impact you if you attended a webinar (or plan to attend one in the future). You’ll have access to materials and recordings from the webinars you’ve attended indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Will we still get updated material and recording access without the subscription?</strong> Yes, you will. Even more, I just implemented a weekly notification mechanism that will send you an e-mail on Sunday morning whenever I upload new materials or make new recordings available for the webinars you’ve attended.</p>
