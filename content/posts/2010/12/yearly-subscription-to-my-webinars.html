<p>A while ago I got an interesting challenge from one of my readers: “<em>I would like to attend a few of your webinars, but the problem I have is that I’m interested in most of them. Is there something we can do?</em>” After a few e-mails, we nailed down the concept I had been playing with for quite a while: <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">yearly subscription package</a>. It gives you <del class="wrong">three</del> <ins class="corr">unlimited access to all</ins> live webinars and year-long access to all the materials and all the recordings I ever made for a fixed price. You can find <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">a detailed description</a>, <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Recordings">list of all recordings</a> and <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Materials">list of all available materials</a> on my web site.</p>
<p>Buying the yearly subscription is easy: select the first webinar you’re interested in (the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Webinars">list of upcoming webinars is also on my web site</a>) and buy the <em>Yearly subscription </em>ticket when registering; <ins class="corr">you can also <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">buy directly from my web site</a></ins>. You’ll get access to the recordings and PDF materials a few minutes after the registration.</p>
