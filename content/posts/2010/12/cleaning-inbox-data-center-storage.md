Links to great data center, storage and virtualization articles found in the depths of my bloated Inbox:

[Technology short takes by Scott Lowe](http://blog.scottlowe.org/2010/12/17/technology-short-take-8/). A must-read.

[Keys to Virtualization Success](http://lonesysadmin.net/2010/12/09/keys-to-virtualization-success/) -- this is how you do it right. Great job, Bob!

FIP, FIP Snooping Bridges, and FCFs: [Part 1 (FIP)](http://brasstacksblog.typepad.com/brass-tacks/2010/11/fip-fip-snooping-bridges-and-fcfs-part-1-fip-the-fcoe-initialization-protocol.html) and [Part 2 (FIP snooping and FCF)](http://brasstacksblog.typepad.com/brass-tacks/2010/12/fip-fip-snooping-bridges-and-fcfs-part-2-fip-snooping-bridges-and-fibre-channel-forwarders.html) -- good in-depth articles (although I still disagree with the need for FIP snooping).

[Creating SAN Port Channels when using NPV mode on Nexus 5k](http://brasstacksblog.typepad.com/brass-tacks/2010/12/creating-san-port-channels-when-using-npv-mode-on-nexus-5k.html) -- no idea what he's talking about, but if you need to combine NPV and SAN port channels, you'll find the solution on Brass Tacks blog.

[Cisco Unified Computing System is 75% Networking - Who Knew?](http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/cisco-unified-computing-system-75-networking-0) You can rely on NetworkWorld to produce oxymoron titles like this one.

[Understanding vSphere Disaster Recovery/Avoidance options](http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/virtual_geek/2010/12/understanding-vsphere-disaster-recoveryavoidance-options.html) -- Before considering stretched clusters, read this (including all the linked-to posts). Consider the complexity. Reread. Repeat.
