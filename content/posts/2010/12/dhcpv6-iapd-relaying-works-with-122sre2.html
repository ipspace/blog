title: DHCPv6 IA_PD relaying works with 12.2SRE2
url: /2010/12/dhcpv6-iapd-relaying-works-with-122sre2/
---

<p>Last week I ran numerous lab tests while preparing router configurations for the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core"><em>Building IPv6 Service Provider Core</em></a><em> </em>webinar. One of the fantastic test results: DHCPv6 relaying works correctly on a 7200 running 12.2(33)SRE2, even when the client requests IA_PD option. </p>
<!--more--><p>Some of the limitations I’ve described in the “<a href="/2010/10/dhcpv6-relaying-another-trouble-spot/"><em>DHCPv6 relaying: another trouble spot?</em></a>” remain (PE router reload is still an issue and you cannot retain DHCPv6 relay bindings when a PPPoE session is disconnected because the associated virtual interface is deleted), but I would say Cisco got as far as they can within the current technological (DHCPv6) and architectural (virtual access interfaces) constraints.</p>
<p>After enabling DHCPv6 relay debugging on the PE-router, you can see relayed requests and static routes installed after the response from the DHCP server carrying IA_PD option is relayed back to the client:</p>

It can’t get any better than that, can it?</p>
