<p>We all knew MARS is becoming a dead end (Cisco first <a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid14_gci1521228,00.html">removed third-party support</a> and then <a href="http://www.infosecurity-us.com/view/13914/where-on-earth-is-mars">stopped developing the product</a>), now it’s official. <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/vpndevc/ps5739/ps6241/eol_c51-636888.html">MARS is dead</a>.</p>
<p>Just in case you haven’t noticed, this is the third security product (after <a href="/2010/08/rest-in-peace-my-waf-friend.html">WAF and XML Gateway</a>) Cisco has killed this year. Are they implementing borderless networks or trimming down to core competences while preparing for onslaught of market adjacencies?</p>
