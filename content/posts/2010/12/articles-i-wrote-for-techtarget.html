<p>Another year-end cleanup action: I wrote lots of articles for SearchTelecom in the last few years. You can find links to all of them (together with those I wrote for SearchNetworking and SearchEnterpriseWan) on <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Ivan_Pepelnjak_on_SearchTelecom">this page</a>. Enjoy!</p>
<p class="note">You have to register with TechTarget to be able to view them, but they do respect your settings (you can decide not to subscribe to any of their mailing lists).</p>
