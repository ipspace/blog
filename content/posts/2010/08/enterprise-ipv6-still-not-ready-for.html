<p>Almost a year ago I wrote a blog post listing <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/11/ipv6-in-data-center-is-cisco-ready.html">various enterprise networking devices from Cisco lacking IPv6 support</a>. As Jessica Scarpati found out (quoting, among other sources, my articles), <a href="http://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/news/article/0,289142,sid200_gci1518449,00.html">not much has changed in the meantime</a> and Cisco is not the only myopic company. For example, according to her article, Riverbed spokesman has “declined a request to discuss how the WAN optimization vendor will help customers with IPv6 migrations, saying the company was not ready to speak publicly about its strategy.” No wonder enterprises are not rushing to join the IPv6 crowd (although <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/08/more-ipv6-fud-being-thrown-cfos.html">there’s no excuse for not having an IPv6-enabled public web site</a>).</p>
<p>To make matters worse, there’s another roadblock to enterprise IPv6 deployment: MPLS VPN services supporting native IPv6 are still rare (and in most cases you can’t have any other routing protocol but EBGP).</p>
