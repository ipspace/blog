<p>Following my <a href="/2010/07/nat444-ds-lite-ap-and-nat64-explained.html">“<em>Transition to IPv6</em>” articles</a>, Jessica Scarpati from SearchTelecom.com wrote a series of articles covering the telecom transition plans and the problems they’re experiencing with the vendors and content providers.</p>
<p>In the second article of the series, “<a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/news/article/0,289142,sid103_gci1517779,00.html"><em>Deploying IPv6? Demand responsiveness from vendors, content providers</em></a>”, she’s quoting John Jason Brzozowski from Comcast, John Curran from ARIN, Matt Sewell from Global Crossing and myself. My key message: vote with your money and take your business elsewhere if the vendors don’t get their act together.</p>
