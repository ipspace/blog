title: Rest in peace, my WAF friend

<p>A few years ago, Cisco bought a company that made application-level firewalls, first an XML-focused product (<em>XML Gateway</em>) that was also able to verify your XML data, later a Web Application Firewall (WAF), which was effectively the XML product with half of the brains ripped out.</p>
<p>I was really looking forward to these products. <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/12/why-would-i-need-web-application.html">Layer-3 firewalls cannot protect web sites against application-layer problems</a> like SQL injections or cross-site scripting, so we definitely need something on the application layer and the WAF (and XML Gateway) ran as virtual appliance in VMware, making them ideal for my lab environment. I quickly lost interest after the first cursory contact with the XML Gateway as you could only manage both products with a <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2008/12/im-too-old-i-prefer-cli-over-gui.html">web-based GUI</a> (and I definitely don’t want to publish blog posts full of screenshots).</p>
<!--more--><p>The development of these products was obviously stopped for quite a while, they <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/11/ipv6-in-data-center-is-cisco-ready.html">never got IPv6 support</a> and now Cisco has <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/contnetw/ps5719/ps9586/end_of_life_c51_609818.html">decided to kill them</a> giving the customers no product migration options.</p>
<p>Killing a product is never a problem for me; I understand the need to consolidate and redesign products and platforms gained through an acquisition and usually Cisco offers a decent migration program. Killing old and obscure technologies makes perfect sense. Exiting a whole (highly relevant) market segment makes me nervous; I don’t doubt it was a right decision for Cisco, but how can we guess which market segment they’ll exit next?</p>
