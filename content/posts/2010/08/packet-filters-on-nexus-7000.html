title: Packet Filters on a Nexus 7000

<p>We’re always quick to criticize ... and usually quiet when we should praise. I’d like to fix one of my omissions: a few days ago I was trying to figure out whether Nexus 7000 supports IPv6 access lists (one of the presentations I was looking at while researching the details for my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/DataCenterIntro">upcoming Data Center webinar</a> implied there might be a problem) and was pleasantly surprised by the breadth of packet filters offered on this platform. Let’s start with a diagram.</p>
<p style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/2010/08/s1600-Nexus+7000+Packet+Filters.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="306" src="/2010/08/s400-Nexus+7000+Packet+Filters.png" width="400"/></a></p>
<!--more--><p>Every packet traversing a Nexus 7000 goes through a number of filters:</p>
<p><strong>Inbound port filters</strong>. You can specify IPv4, IPv6 and MAC filters.</p>
<p><strong>VLAN filters</strong>. Whenever a packet is bridged within a VLAN, <strong>vlan access-map </strong>is applied. VLAN access maps can match on IPv4, IPv6 and MAC addresses (using already-defined access-lists) and even redirect a packet to another interface for further analysis. VLAN filters can be applied to a range of VLANs to improve configuration scalability.</p>
<p>Obviously this step is skipped if the inbound interface is a layer-3 interface.</p>
<p><strong>Routed port ACL</strong>. Whenever a packet enters or exits the layer-3 forwarding engine, it can be filtered with inbound/outbound ACL. Yet again, both IPv4 and IPv6 ACL are supported. If the packet is forwarded between two VLANs, the destination VLAN filter is also applied.</p>
<p><strong>TrustSec Security Group</strong>. Last but not least, every packet traversing the Nexus 7000 is checked by TrustSec security group ACL (SGACL).</p>
<p>I would love to go into so many details in my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/DC30">Data Center 3.0 for Networking Engineers</a> webinar (<a href="https://www.ipspace.net/SingleRecording?code=DC30">buy a recording</a> or <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">yearly subscription</a>) but it’s quite impossible due to timing constraints and the breadth of technologies we’re covering. The “further reading” list that's part of the webinar materials should help you find in-depth information on the topics discussed in the webinar.</p>
