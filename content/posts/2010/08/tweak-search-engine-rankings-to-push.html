<p>We all know that IPv6 deployment is a chicken-and-egg problem: Service Providers are slow to adopt IPv6 (there are some notable exceptions, including <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/05/comcast-signs-first-ipv6-corporate.html">Comcast</a>) because they can’t charge for it and the content providers don’t care because there are no IPv6 customers.</p>
<p>My good friend Jan Žorž got a great idea during the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/06/slovenians-presenting-leading-edge-ipv6.html">Google IPv6 Implementers Conference</a> and finally managed to write it down: all we need is a <a href="http://go6.si/2010/08/suggestion-for-internet-search-engines-proposed-ipv6-impact-on-search-engine-scoring-algorithms/">slight search engine preference for sites reachable over IPv4 <em>and </em>IPv6</a>. A small well-publicized tweak in Google’s scoring algorithm would push the content providers toward IPv6 and force web hosting companies to roll out IPv6 support immediately.</p>
