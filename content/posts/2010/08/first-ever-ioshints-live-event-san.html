<p>Webinars are great (say most of the attendees ;) but I miss meeting people. Webinars are just the right mechanism for <a href="http://spmarkettrends.eventbrite.com/">brief technology updates</a>, <a href="http://nextgenerationipservices.eventbrite.com/">overviews</a> or <a href="http://dmvpn.eventbrite.com/">in-depth configuration discussions</a>, but it’s nearly impossible to do a lively design discussion involving a reasonably-sized group of engineers over the web. The desire to do a live event was thus slowly brewing for almost a year and finally turned into reality: on September 15<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span> you can join me in San Jose for the first ever <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/IOSHints_Live_San_Jose"><em>Ioshints Live</em></a> event.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss two hot topics: <a href="http://ioshintsdatacenter.eventbrite.com/">data centers</a> (I simply had to use the vapor word in the title) and <a href="http://ioshintsvpn.eventbrite.com/">VPN solutions</a>. Both sessions will be focused on design issues and your real-life needs. <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/IOSHints_Live_San_Jose">The registration is open</a>; if you decide to join us for the whole day, just register for both sessions.</p>
