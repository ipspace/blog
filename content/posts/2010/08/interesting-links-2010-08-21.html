<p>Two interesting QoS-focused posts from last week: Brad Hedlund was <a href="http://bradhedlund.com/2010/08/16/cisco-ucs-qos-vs-hp-virtual-connect-rate-limiting/">explaining the difference between UCS and HP Virtual Connect QoS</a> (short summary: one does queuing, the other one rate-limiting) and Russell Heilling <a href="http://perlmonkey.blogspot.com/2010/08/when-is-video-prioritisation-good-vs.html">nicely described the QoS problems encountered in a Service Provider network</a> (he’s coming to the same conclusion as I did: <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/07/p2p-traffic-is-bad-for-network.html">we need per-user queuing</a>, but describes it way more eloquently).</p>
<p>After I’d stumbled upon <a href="http://perlmonkey.blogspot.com/">Russell’s blog</a>, I started reading his older posts and found a nice in-depth explanation of <a href="http://perlmonkey.blogspot.com/2010/08/paved-with-good-intentions.html">one potential road to Net Neutrality hell paved with good intentions</a>.</p>
<p>And, in a blitz of late news, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/08/10/coraid_esg/">ATAoE has resurrected like Phoenix from its ashes</a>.</p>
