<p>Several interesting blog posts I’ve stumbled upon in the last few days:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.serverfault.com/post/893001713/should-developers-have-access-to-production">Should developers have access to production?</a> A really good analysis of pros and cons (including a pinch of “this is how it’s always been done”).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jeremyfilliben.com/2010/08/migrating-from-catalyst-to-nexus.html">Migrating from Catalyst to Nexus</a>. As usual, there are hidden gotchas and varying default settings that make the migration more interesting than expected.</p>
<p><a href="http://itblog.emc.com/2010/04/26/justifying-vdi-%E2%80%93-part-one/">Justifying VDI</a>. VMware has decided to deploy virtual desktops; they describe what they’ve learnt and how you should approach VDI projects.</p>
