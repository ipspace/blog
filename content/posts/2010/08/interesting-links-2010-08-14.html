<p>A few days ago I wrote that you should always strive to understand the technologies beyond the reach of your current job. Stephen Foskett is an amazing example to follow: although he’s a storage guru, he knows way more about HTTP than most web developers and details of the web server architecture that most server administrators are not aware of. Read his <a href="http://blog.fosketts.net/2010/07/30/high-performance-memory-apache-php-virtual-private-server/">High-Performance, Low-Memory Apache/PHP Virtual Private Server</a>; you’ll definitely enjoy the details. </p>
<p>And then there’s the ultimate weekend fun: reading Greg’s perspectives on storage and FCoE. It starts with his <a href="http://etherealmind.com/myth-fibrechannel-over-token-ring/">Magic of FCoTR</a> post (forget the FCoTR joke and focus on the futility of lossless layer-2 networks) and continues with Rivka’s <a href="http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/networkhub/fibre-channel-over-token-ring-converged-storage-dilemma-solvedd/">hilarious report on the FCoTR progress</a>. Oh, and just in case you never knew what TR was all about – it was “somewhat” different, but never lossless, so it would be as bad a choice for FC as Ethernet is.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there’s Kevin Bovis, the veritable fountain of common sense, this time delving with the <a href="http://etherealmind.com/the-ancient-and-noble-art-of-troubleshooting/">ancient and noble art of troubleshooting</a>. A refreshing must-read.</p>
