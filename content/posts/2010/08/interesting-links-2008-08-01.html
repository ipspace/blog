<p>Some of the interesting things I’ve stumbled across lately (mostly thanks to my Twitter friends):</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorcerer%27s_Apprentice_Syndrome">Sorcerer's Apprentice Syndrome</a>: this is what happens to sloppily designed protocols. Interestingly, my Msc thesis was a purely academic approach to testing protocol correctness. I decided to use X.25 as the example (and of course it worked); this one would be really fun.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.staticnat.com/WP/2010/07/30/do-not-social-engineer-yourself-out-of-clients-or-your-job/">Do Not Social Engineer Yourself out of Clients or your Job!</a> If you’re Twitter happy and think it’s a good idea to <a href="http://foursquare.com/">pollute everyone’s feed with your locations</a> (are you listening @<a href="http://twitter.com/icemarkom">icemarkom</a>?) think twice – you could actually leak sensitive client information.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.telegeography.com/cu/article.php?article_id=28943">KPN to stop offering 'free' mobiles</a>. This one is a year old and it took me a while to dig it out. A no-nonsense approach to loss-making residential customers that I will not comment; I can live without <a href="/2010/07/p2p-traffic-and-internet-part-2.html">yet another <em>shill </em>label</a> for a few days.</p>
