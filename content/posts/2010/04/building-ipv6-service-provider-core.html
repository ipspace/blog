---

<p>The next <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core">Building IPv6 Service Provider Core</a> is scheduled for June 16<sup>th</sup> and starts 6 hours earlier than the last one. The registration on EventBrite is already opened; <a href="http://spipv6.eventbrite.com/">just following this link to register</a>.</p>
<p class="note">Davor made a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/04/thank-you-for-all-webinar-help.html#comments">very valid observation</a> in his comment: the last webinar was way too late for East Asia and Australia (I am vaguely aware that the Earth is not totally flat, but forgot to consider the actual time difference between Australia and Europe); the change in start time should make it more manageable for Asia-Pacific engineers to attend.</p>
