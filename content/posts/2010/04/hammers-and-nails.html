<p>If you’re on the buying side of the IT industry, you’ll love the “<a href="http://storagebod.typepad.com/storagebods_blog/2010/03/42-is-the-answer.html">42 is the answer</a>” post by <a href="http://storagebod.typepad.com/">Storagebod</a>. The really fun part describes vendors trying to properly position themselves ... and failing in the process:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">When all you have is a hammer, every problem looks a nail but even if your hammer is the best hammer in all the world and sure you could bang in a screw, at the end of the day, there will be dissatisfaction with results.</blockquote>
<p>BTW, his question that gives the answer 42 is way too narrow (although personally relevant; just read his post); Douglas Adams took a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">much wider perspective</a>.</p>
