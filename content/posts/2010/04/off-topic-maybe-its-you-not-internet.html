<p>Scott Berkun has (yet another) fantastic article on his blog: <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/151266/What-to-do-about-teaching-and-the-internet">a teacher was complaining that the students use Facebook or check their e-mail in class</a>. Scott’s response? Maybe it’s the teaching skills and the fascination with one-way lecturing, not the Internet, that’s at fault. <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2010/should-the-web-be-allowed-in-class/">Read the whole response</a>; if you’ve been faced with too many narrow-minded teachers in your life, you’ll enjoy it as much as I did.</p>
