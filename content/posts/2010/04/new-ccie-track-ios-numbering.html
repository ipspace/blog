<p>In a comment to my “<i><a href="/2010/04/did-you-notice-151t-is-released/">Did you notice 15.1T is released?</a></i>” post <i>kcuorbax</i> shared exciting news about the new CCIE track launched yesterday:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">CCIE Numbering experts will have the outstanding ability to find if a bug fixed in release A is fixed in release B. They will understand why new features are inadvertently introduced in mainline trains and why developers forget to commit fixes in the branches where the bugs were discovered. They will master the double numbering of IOS-XE and the sudden change from 12.2XN to 15.0S.</blockquote>
<p>Anyone brave enough to try to take this exam?</p>
