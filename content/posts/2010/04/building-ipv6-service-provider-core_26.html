<p>I’m yet again late processing the survey results for my last webinar; we took our kids to vacations two days after the event and I’m still trying to cope with everything that accumulated while I was gone. Here are several wonderful quotes from the surveys:</p>
<blockquote class='cite'><p>I have attended a few Cisco venues like Networkers and Topgun seminars but I felt this was far better. For me (I implemented IPv6 duals-stack in our MPLS core about a year ago) it was easy to follow and I knew most parts. But there were a few new tricks for me as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">Jon Harald Bøvre</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">The presentation was well prepared and communicated.  I like the WebEX platform choice. In addition, I appreciated how detailed the presentation was and the downloadable configuration files.  I've already signed up for "Choosing the Optimal VPN" class in March.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">Christopher Hunt</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not very much useful information for what I do (we are a small/mid sized ISP). We don't do any MPLS as there is no reason. However for the price, it was fine information.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">Chris Bissell</p>
<p>Good overview of a fairly complex topic.</p>

<!--more--><p>The grades were pretty much in line with my other courses (although as <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2010/03/market-trends-in-sp-networks-survey.html"><em>Bad designer</em> pointed out</a>, <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2010/03/off-topic-survey-bias.html">take them with a grain of salt</a>) with audio remaining a hot issue. </p>

Webex claims you don’t need more than 64 kbps with static slides, so I’m positive everyone had enough bandwidth. The recordings (taken on Webex servers, not locally) are also quite good (apart from the <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2010/03/off-topic-sounding-like-tin-man.html">Tin Man effect</a>), so it looks like the audio problems are caused by local congestion/QoS issues that I cannot influence. </p>
<p>One of the participants suggested using a voice conference bridge; unfortunately, the one provided by Webex is prohibitively expensive for the <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2010/03/new-webinar-pricing.html">current pricing</a> and I doubt you’d be willing to make a 2-hour call to Central Europe. </p>
