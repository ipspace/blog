<p>Recently-published <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5837">RFC 5837 describes additions to ICMP messages</a> that would allow you to gather more information (including interface ifIndex, IP address and name). Two obvious applications are <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5837">enhanced <em>traceroute</em></a> and path MTU discovery where the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5837">new ICMP extensions could indicate which interface is the MTU bottleneck</a>.</p>
<p>The RFC authors come from BT, Juniper and Cisco, so there’s a non-zero chance it will actually get implemented where it’s most needed.</p>
