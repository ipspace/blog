<p>Every now and then an incident reminds us how vulnerable BGP is. Very few of these incidents are intentional (the <a href="/2008/02/building-customer-resilient-bgp.html">Pakistan vs. YouTube</a> is a rare exception) and <a href="http://www.renesys.com/blog/2010/04/how-to-build-a-cybernuke.shtml">few of them are propagated far enough to matter on a global scale</a> (<a href="/2009/02/oversized-as-paths-cisco-ios-bug.html">bugs in BGP implementations are scarier</a>). Most of these incidents could be prevented with either Secure BGP or Secure Origin BGP but it looks like <a href="/2010/03/secure-bgp.html">they will not be implemented any time soon</a>.</p>
<!--more--><p>Contrary to that, the e-business transactions protected with SSL certificates look well protected ... until you start exploring the details. As Kurt Seifried documented in Linux Magazine, <a href="http://www.linux-magazine.com/w3/issue/114/054-055_kurt.pdf">almost anyone can become a root CA and issue certificates for any domain</a> and it’s quite easy to get certificates for well-known domains. If you like a bit more in-depth discussion, read <a href="http://files.cloudprivacy.net/ssl-mitm.pdf"><em>Certified Lies: Detecting and Defeating Government Interception Attacks Against SSL</em></a> ... and don’t forget that an <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/packet-forensics/">appliance performing the MITM attacks is on the market</a>.</p>
<p>The moral of this story: no technology, no matter how sophisticated, can help you if another link in the chain-of-trust is broken (and the broken link is often a human problem), while an inherently unsecure protocol can be made pretty safe by following common-sense best practices ... but you knew that already, didn’t you?</p>
