title: Did you notice 15.1T is released?

<p>Unveiling of the Cisco IOS release 15.1(1)T was the extreme opposite of the <a href="/2010/03/crs-3-marketing-flop-of-year/">CRS-3</a> and <a href="/2010/03/borderless-networks-take-two/">Catalyst 3750-X</a> splashes; the next release of one of the foundations of Cisco’s core business deserved a <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/whatsnew/whatsnew.html">modest two-paragraph</a> mention in the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/whatsnew/whatsnew.html">What's New in Cisco Product Documentation</a> page.</p>
<p>If you’re a voice guru, you’ll probably enjoy the list of 20+ voice-related <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/15_1/release/notes/151TNEWF.html">new features</a>, including the all-important <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucme/admin/configuration/guide/cmemoh.html">Enhanced Music on Hold</a>. For the rest of us, here’s what I found particularly interesting:</p>
<!--more--><ul><li><a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/cether/configuration/guide/ce_cfm-ieee.html">Ethernet OAM is finally available on low-end platforms</a>. Now it makes sense to implement end-to-end Carrier Ethernet architectures.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ipsla/configuration/guide/sla_auto_ipslas_ps10592_TSD_Products_Configuration_Guide_Chapter.html">IP SLA engine was rewritten</a>.</li>
<li>In a huge engineering effort, <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/mpls/configuration/guide/mp_any_transport.html"><strong>mpls mtu </strong>command was added to the GRE tunnel interface</a>.</li>
<li>15.1T has <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/fundamentals/configuration/guide/cf_config-lock.html">parser concurrency and locking</a> features from 12.2SRE. They give you a finer locking granularity when multiple engineers concurrently configure the same device.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/sec_data_plane/configuration/guide/sec_zone_polcy_firew.html">Zone-based firewall</a> feature has a few more knobs and show commands.</li>
<li>The <strong>police </strong>MQC command finally works on the SVI interfaces.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/netmgmt/configuration/guide/nm_cfg_wsma.html">DHCP zero-touch deployment</a> allows you to pass pointer to a web-based router configuration to a newly-deployed router in a DHCP option.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, finally ... <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/netmgmt/configuration/guide/nm_script_tcl.html">Tcl supports UDP sockets and VRF-based sockets</a>. We’ll have so much fun with this feature; for example, we’ll be able to <a href="/2009/01/things-you-cannot-do-with-tclsh/">wake a host from a router</a> or connect to an external server residing in a VRF.</p>
<p class="warn">Oh, BTW, if you wanted to save money and test this release on your <a href="/2010/02/death-of-dynamips-theyve-got-it-all/">Dynamips-enabled 7200 clone</a>, you’re out of luck; 15.1T runs only <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/15_1/release/notes/151TREQS.html">ISR and newer hardware</a>.</p>
