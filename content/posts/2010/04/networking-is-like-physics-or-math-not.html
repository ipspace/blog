title: Networking is like physics or math, not history

<p>Every so often I stumble across a blog post (or receive an e-mail) complaining how hard it is to learn the material needed to pass a certification exam. That’s definitely true if you try the memorization approach to networking: trying to cram as many facts as possible into your grey matter. However, it’s impossible to make any reasonable progress that way; to move forward, you have to handle networking like you would math or physics: having a firm basic foundation, you slowly expand it, all the time trying to fit the new concepts into a coherent model (let’s call it “the big picture”).</p>
<!--more--><p>Every single internetworking technology (or solution) was invented and introduced for a very good reason; it was trying to solve a particular set of problems within an environment that posed a unique set of restrictions. Trying to memorize how something works (or how you configure a particular device feature) is close to impossible if you don’t have the big picture; it’s like trying to learn history by memorizing the years of important events, without understanding their correlation (yes, that’s how I was taught history ... and I promptly managed to forget most of it).</p>
<p>To really progress in your networking studies, you have to focus on understanding how various technologies work and why they work that way ... and then, if you’re at least a little bit devious, you start to experiment: imagine a <a href="/2008/10/ospf-challenge-1-establish-ospf/">crazy scenario</a> that your theory (your mental “big picture”) predicts will fail, try it out in the lab, observe whether the results match with your mental model predictions, and <a href="/2008/10/ospf-challenge-1-final-results/">try to fix it</a>.</p>
