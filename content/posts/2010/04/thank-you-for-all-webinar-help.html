<p>The Wednesday's <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core"><em>Building IPv6 Service Provider Core</em></a> was a huge success (compared to the previous one); I had three times as many attendees from all over the world (map below) even though the topic was highly technical and pretty limited in scope. I can’t tell you how delighted I am that it went so well and I would like to thank (again) everyone who <a href="/2010/03/can-you-help-me-fix-webinar-marketing.html">chimed in with improvement ideas</a>. </p>

<!--more--><p>It looks like webinar price was a very important issue; one of the participants said “<em>keep up the $50 promo</em>” during the chat at the end of the webinar ... and you don’t have to worry; for the moment that’s the “official” pricing. However, I would appreciate your input on the geographical distribution of attendees. I am not surprised that nobody from China or India attended, but Canada, Australia, South Africa and South America are missing as well, even though Australia and Canada have pretty high population of returning readers. Any ideas?</p>
