<p>I never believed I would see this: OSPF is becoming a multi-protocol routing protocol. RFC 5838 specifies how you can <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5838">redefine the <em>instance ID </em>field in OSPFv3 to support four address families</a> (IPv6 and IPv4 unicast+multicast).</p>
<p class="note"><a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2010/04/first-ever-end-to-end-optical-traffic.html">A month ago</a>, I would have added CLNP and IPX to the list; unfortunately they’ve missed that particular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools'_Day_RFC">window of opportunity</a> ;)</p>
<p>It looks like this feature currently runs in PowerPoint and in a <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/strategy/docs/gov/OSPFv3_aag.pdf">very-limited-availability image</a> (if you’ve seen it working on an actual box, let me know).</p>
