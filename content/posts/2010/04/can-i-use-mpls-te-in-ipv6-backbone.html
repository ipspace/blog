<p><a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/home/0,289692,sid103,00.html">SearchTelecom</a> has invited me to a new project: <em>Ask the Expert</em>. Anyone can <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/expert/KnowledgebasePoseQuestion/0,289624,sid103_tax316277,00.html">send me service provider-related questions through their web page</a> ... and I’ll do my best to find a reasonable answer (curveball questions trying to trip me are not considered fair ;).</p>
<p>One of the first questions was quite interesting: <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/expert/KnowledgebaseAnswer/0,289625,sid103_gci1506628,00.html">Can I use MPLS traffic engineering in an IPv6 backbone?</a> As the participants of my last week’s <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core">Building IPv6 Service Provider core</a> webinar have learned, you can use MPLS TE (today) only if you transport IPv6 across MPLS-enabled IPv4 backbone. You’ll find <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/expert/KnowledgebaseAnswer/0,289625,sid103_gci1506628,00.html">a few more details in my answer</a> and I’ve <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/03/is-ismpls-tenative-ipv6fail.html">documented a particularly nasty border case</a> a while ago; for even more details, there’s always the <a href="http://spipv6.eventbrite.com/">next iteration of my webinar</a>.</p>
