title: First-ever end-to-end optical traffic grooming with CRS-3
url: /2010/04/first-ever-end-to-end-optical-traffic/
---

<p>One of the exciting new features of the <a href="/2010/03/crs-3-marketing-flop-of-year/">recently launched CRS-3 router</a> enables Service Providers to implement first-ever all-optical end-to-end traffic grooming. One of the new linecards (unfortunately not compatible with CRS-1 due to increased hardware complexity) supports the SFSS protocol (defined in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4824">RFC 4824</a>).</p>
<p>Using a high-quality video link and all-optical spatial separators you can easily transport more than one SFSS instance on the same wavelength, allowing you to implement a true sub-lambda traffic grooming in the optical domain. There’s just one gotcha: due to the encoding requirements of SFSS, you cannot carry it in the dense channel spacing of DWDM; you have to use CWDM or even wider optical bands <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4824">depending on the receiver’s capabilities</a>.</p>
