<p>If you’re working in a Service Provider environment, you should be planning or implementing IPv6 rollout by now (we all know that the <a href="http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html">public IPv4 address pools will be depleted in two years</a>). If you’re still pondering various design options or would like to get some additional configuration hints and advices, my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core"><em>Building IPv6 Service Provider core</em></a> might be the perfect solution. It’s scheduled for April 14<sup>th</sup>, just a week from today, so make sure you <a href="http://spipv6.eventbrite.com/">register now</a>.</p>
