<p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789">This looks like another April 1st RFC</a> (but it's apparently not):</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Several applications extending the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)    require a feature to do partial resource modification.  The existing    HTTP PUT method only allows a complete replacement of a document.    This proposal adds a new HTTP method, PATCH, to modify an existing    HTTP resource.</blockquote>
