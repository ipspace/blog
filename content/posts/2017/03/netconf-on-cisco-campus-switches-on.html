<p>During Cisco Live Europe (huge thanks to <a href="http://techfieldday.com/event/cleur17/">Tech Field Day crew for bringing me there</a>) I had a chat with Jeff McLaughlin about NETCONF support on Cisco IOS XE, in particular on the campus switches.</p>
<p>We started with the obvious question “<em>why would someone want to have NETCONF on a campus switch</em>”, continued with “<em>why would you use NETCONF and not REST API</em>”, and diverted into “<em>who loves regular expressions</em>”. Teasing aside, we discussed:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>How you can get structured operational data (in XML format) from Cisco IOS XE devices.</li>
<li>What ConfD is doing behind the scenes.</li>
<li>How SNMP MIBs will live forever, even if it’s only in XML-in-NETCONF format.</li>
<li>Why you’d use NETCONF and not SNMP to read operational data.</li>
<li>What is Open Network Plug-and-Play and how it works</li>
<li>The bright future of Python on the Catalyst switches.</li>
</ul>
<p>In between the technical discussions we touched on high-level points including: </p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Who would want to use network programmability on campus switches and why?</li>
<li>Can you automate troubleshooting if you have structured operational data?</li>
<li>What software release do you need to get these goodies?</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, Jeff sent me this explanation to make sure you understand the exact details of the new NETCONF agent on Cisco IOS XE:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>YANG-ified SNMP MIBs, as mentioned, were the first operational models;</li>
<li>Then we had some models using screen scraping;</li>
<li>Models with direct access to native device data structures are coming, but not yet released.</li>
</ul>
