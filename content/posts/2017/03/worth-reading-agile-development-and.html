<p>Matthias Luft (a good friend of mine, and a <a href="/2017/03/guest-speakers-in-building-next.html">guest speaker</a> in the upcoming <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">Building Next-Generation Data Center course</a>) wrote a <a href="https://insinuator.net/2017/02/agile-development-security/">great post</a> about the (lack of) security in software development.</p>
<p>The parts I like most (and they apply equally well to networking):<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Become part of the development project;</li>
<li>Commit some of your time to the project;</li>
<li>Understand what the developers are doing (and why);</li>
<li>Evaluate the technology they want to use and tell them what the problems might be (before they throw the results into your lap);</li>
<li>Do micro-assessments;</li>
<li>Automate ;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hint: You’ll be able to meet us both in real life if you <a href="https://www.troopers.de/troopers17/">register for Troopers 17</a> and in virtual classroom if you register for the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">Building Next-Generation Data Center online course</a>.</p>
