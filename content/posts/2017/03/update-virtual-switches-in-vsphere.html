<p>Just FYI: a week after I wrote <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/03/running-vsphere-on-cisco-aci-think-twice.html">this</a> (don't forget to go through the comments), VMware <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/networkvirtualization/2017/03/native-vswitch.html">made it official</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">…we’ve found that VMware’s native virtual switch implementation has become the de facto standard for greater than 99% of vSphere customers today. … Moving forward, VMware will have a single virtual switch strategy that focuses on two sets of native virtual switch offerings – VMware vSphere® Standard Switch and vSphere Distributed Switch™ for VMware vSphere, and the Open virtual switch (OVS).</blockquote>
