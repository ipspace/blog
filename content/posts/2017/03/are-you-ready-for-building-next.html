title: Are You Ready for Building Next-Generation Data Center Course?

<p>I often get questions from engineers wondering whether my webinars or courses would be too tough for them. Here’s a question I got from an engineer who wanted to attend my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">Building Next-Generation Data Center</a> course: “<em>What specific prior experience do you expect for this workshop?</em>”<!--more--></p>
<p>The course is targeted toward networking engineers, so I'm assuming you understand routing and switching, and higher-layer protocols like TCP and DNS (let's say "CCNP level" knowledge).</p>
<p>I know that many networking engineers don’t know enough about server and network virtualization, data center fabrics, application-level challenges or networking in private and public clouds, so I included introductory materials covering all these topics (and IPv6) in the <a href="http://nextgendc.ipspace.net/Public:Materials">self-study materials</a>. You study them on your own, write down all questions you might encounter (or ask them in the course Slack team), and we’ll discuss them during live sessions (here are the <a href="http://nextgendc.ipspace.net/Public:Questions_2016">questions I got in autumn 2016</a>).</p>
<p>In short: if you’re reading this blog, you’re probably ready… but<strong> </strong>be prepared to study really hard for the next 2-3 months and spend days watching those videos. You will, however, learn a <strong>lot</strong> of things, and get answers to all (or at least most) of the questions you might get.</p>
<p>The engineer asking the question accepted the challenge. Will you? <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center#register">Register here</a>.</p>
