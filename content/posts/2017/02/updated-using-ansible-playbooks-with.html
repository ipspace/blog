<p>Some of the engineers building Ansible-with-VIRL lab in my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions online course</a> experienced interesting challenges, so I made the how-to instructions more explicit and added a troubleshooting section to the <a href="http://automation.ipspace.net/Example:Using_Ansible_Playbooks_with_Cisco_VIRL">Using Ansible Playbooks with Cisco VIRL</a> document. Hope you’ll find them useful.</p>
