title: 'EVPN: All that Glitters Is Not Gold'

<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>Cumulus Linux 3.2 shipped with a rudimentary EVPN implementation and everyone got really excited, including <a href="https://cumulusnetworks.com/blog/future-web-scale-networking/">smaller ASIC manufacturers that finally got a control plane for their hardware VTEP functionality</a>.</p>
<p>However, while it’s nice to have EVPN support in Cumulus Linux, the claims of its benefits are sometimes greatly exaggerated.<!--more--></p>
<p>For example, David Iles from Mellanox <a href="https://cumulusnetworks.com/blog/future-web-scale-networking/">claims</a> that “<em>… with EVPN, we have an industry standardized control plane for VTEP orchestration using an extension of BGP</em>” and “<em>… EVPN will deliver many of the promises of TRILL, FabricPath, VCS, and other data center fabrics but in a scalable, non-proprietary, way</em>”</p>
<p>Let’s get a few things straight:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>TRILL is as standard as EVPN (if not more). Mentioning TRILL in the same list as VCS and FabricPath is disingenuous.</li>
<li>As much as I love EVPN, TRILL has fewer options and thus higher chance of having at least two interoperable implementations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, EVPN can be implemented in so many ways that I started calling it “the SIP of networking”. For example, at the moment (in release 3.2.1) Cumulus Linux <a href="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/display/DOCS/Ethernet+Virtual+Private+Network+-+EVPN">implements only Type-3 routes</a> (similar to what Cisco Nexus 1000V was doing) and relies on dynamic MAC learning, while Cisco’s and Juniper’s implementations on ToR switches use BGP-based MAC+IP address propagation with Type-2 routes.</p>
<p class="update">2017-02-23: Cumulus Linux <a href="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/display/DOCS/Ethernet+Virtual+Private+Network+-+EVPN">already supports type-2 (MAC/IP) routes</a>. That was fast ;) However, I got a hefty dose of “these are all the things that can go wrong” information a few days back, and it's even worse than what I thought. More details in a future blog post.</p>
<p>I’m also hearing rumors that symmetrical IRB (Cisco) and asymmetrical IRB (Juniper) implementations (you’ll find more details in the <em>Mixed Layer-2 + Layer-3 Designs</em> part of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Architectures"><em>Leaf-and-Spine Architectures</em></a><em> </em>webinar) don’t work well together… or maybe that’s just FUD - I would love to hear from someone who got EVPN working between a Nexus 9000 and QFX 5100 or QFX 10K.</p>
