Running BGP instead of an IGP in your leaf-and-spine fabric sounds interesting (mainly if your fabric is large enough). Configuring a zillion BGP knobs on every box doesn't.

However, BGP doesn't have to be complex. In the [Simplify BGP Configurations](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Clos/7.16%20-%20Simplifying%20BGP%20Configurations.mp4) video (part of [leaf-and-spine fabric designs webinar](http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Architectures)) [Dinesh Dutt](http://www.ipspace.net/Author:Dinesh_Dutt) explains how you can make BGP configurations simple and easy-to-understand.
