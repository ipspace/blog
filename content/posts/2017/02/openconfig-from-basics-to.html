<p>In 2013, large-scale cloud providers and ISPs decided they had enough of the glacial IETF process of generating YANG models used to describe device configuration and started <a href="http://www.openconfig.net/">OpenConfig</a> – a customer-only initiative that quickly created data models covering typical use cases of the founding members (aka “What Does Google Need”).<!--more--></p>

These are just some of the topics I discussed with Marcel Wiget in <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_72-OpenConfig.mp3">Episode 72</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a>. </p>
