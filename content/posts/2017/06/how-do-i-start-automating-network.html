title: How Do I Start Automating Network Device Configurations in an Existing Network?

<p>I get a “<em>how do I get started with network automation” </em>question every other week, and when I wrote a lengthy reply to one about configuration templating of existing snowflake network on networktocode Slack channel I decided it’s time to turn my replies into a blog post.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Go for easy wins</strong>. Periodically store configurations into a source control repository. Use RANCID, Oxydized, or something as simple as my <a href="https://github.com/ipspace/ansible-examples/tree/master/Config-to-Git">Configuration-to-Git Ansible playbooks</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Start small</strong>. Abstract common variables in a data model, and use templates to build simple things (NTP servers, syslog servers, DNS servers, VTY lines…). </p>
<p><strong>C</strong><strong>heck the proposed changes.</strong> Use Ansible <strong>--check-mode</strong> to identify the changes your templates would make to the network devices before deploying them. Collect those changes into a change report, get it approved, and then re-run the same playbook without <em>check </em>mode.</p>
<p class="info">It’s a bit tricky to collect those changes when running Ansible in <em>check </em>mode until you figure out how <strong>check_mode </strong>parameter works (hat tip to David Barroso and his <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Ansible#NAPALM">awesome NAPALM presentation</a>). <a href="https://github.com/ipspace/MPLS-infrastructure">Here’s an example</a> till I find time to write a proper blog post.</p>
<p><strong>Start compliance reports</strong>. Checking your templated configurations against actual device configurations is a great way to ensure nothing bad happened to the device configurations.</p>
<p><strong>Grow one configuration object at a time.</strong> After fixing the common configuration snippets, continue with more challenging concepts like routing protocols or VLANs. Yet again, you might find my <a href="https://github.com/ipspace/MPLS-infrastructure">MPLS deployment</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ipspace/VLAN-service">VLAN services</a> playbooks useful. They’re both pretty complex – I spent hours explaining the VLAN services solution in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions online course</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Add the snowflakes.</strong> After a while, when you manage most things with Ansible, use the brownfield trick from David Barroso to include device-specific configurations (<a href="https://github.com/dravetech/napalm-ansible-tutorial/tree/master/ansible">source code on Github</a>, videos are part of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible for Networking Engineers webinar</a>).</p>
<p>That should bring you to the stage where you control the whole configuration with an automation script, but have unstructured per-device exceptions. Next step: figure out what those exceptions are, why you made them in the first place, and <strong>abstract the snowflakes</strong> (per-user, per-service, per-site, per-whatever). I <a href="/2016/07/automate-exceptions.html">wrote about that challenge</a> almost exactly a year ago. </p>
<p>Finally – if you’d like to get a head start, consider attending a training like my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions"><em>Building Network Automation Solutions</em></a> course.</p>
