title: Self-Study Exercises Added to Ansible for Networking Engineers Webinar
url: /2017/06/self-study-exercises-added-to-ansible.html
---

<p>Last week I published self-study exercises for the YAML and Jinja2 modules in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers"><em>Ansible for Networking Engineers</em></a> webinars, and a long list of review questions for the <em>Using Ansible</em> and <em>Ansible Deeper Dive</em> sections.</p>
<p>I also reformatted the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Ansible">webinar materials page</a>. Hope you’ll find the new format easier to read than the old one (it’s hard to squeeze over 70 videos and links on a single page ;).</p>
<p>Oh, and you do know you get Ansible webinar (and <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/bin/bom/overview">over 50 other webinars</a>) with <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">ipSpace.net subscription</a>, right?</p>
