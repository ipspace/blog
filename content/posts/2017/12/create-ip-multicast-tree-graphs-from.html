title: Create IP Multicast Tree Graphs from Operational Data

<p>A while ago I created an Ansible playbook that <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/10/create-network-diagram-from-lldp.html">creates network diagrams from LLDP information</a>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benrobertsuk/">Ben Roberts</a>, a student in my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course used those ideas to create an awesome solution: he’s graphing multicast trees.</p>
<p>Here’s how he described <a href="https://github.com/optiz0r/ansible-multicast-graph">his solution</a>:<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite"><p>Wrote an Ansible playbook that creates a visual representation of the shared and source-specific PIM trees, and IGMP snooping for a single multicast group across a chunk of the network.</p>
<p>Data is scraped from switches using ntc_show_command and some custom textfsm scripts. Ansible does the scraping of data and writes out intermediate yaml files per host, then compiles them all into a single document. Then it generates a dot file using a jinja2 template, in which I'm abusing filters to do all the business logic in python.</p>
<div class="separator"><a href="/2017/12/s1600-multicast_map.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" data-original-height="726" data-original-width="1600" src="/2017/12/s500-multicast_map.png"/></a></div>
<p>Now when an $end_user complains that they're having problems with a particular group, we can kick off this job (which takes a couple mins to fetch all the data, and then a few seconds to graph it) to work out where the flow is coming from and being subscribed to ;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="update">The source code for Ben's solution is in his <a href="https://github.com/optiz0r/ansible-multicast-graph">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve seen plenty of network management systems that can draw network diagrams, there might be some that can draw how a particular VLAN looks like, but I’ve never seen something that could do it for a multicast tree – another proof how useful read-only automation can be in your network.</p>
