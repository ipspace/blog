<p>Here’s a quote from one of my friends who spent years working with Ansible playbooks:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Debugging Ansible is one of the most terrible experiences one can endure…</blockquote>
<p>It’s not THAT bad, particularly if you have a good debugging toolbox. I described mine in the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=AnsibleOC#DEBUGGING">Debugging Ansible Playbooks</a> part of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible for Networking Engineers</a> online course.</p>
<p class="more">Please note that the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course includes all material from the Ansible online course.</p>
