title: Salt Deep Dive on Building Network Automation Solutions Online Course

---

<p>In the first few sessions of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course we used Ansible as the tool-of-choice because it’s the easiest automation tool to get started with. Now that we’ve established the baseline, it’s time to explore the alternatives.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://automation.ipspace.net/Public:Live_sessions">live session on February 27th 2018</a>, Mircea Ulinic will <a href="http://automation.ipspace.net/Public:4-Changing_Network_Configurations_or_State">describe Salt</a>, an open source, general-purpose event-driven automation framework that we briefly discussed in <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/04/salt-and-saltstack-on-software-gone-wild.html">Episode 77</a> of Software Gone Wild podcast.<!--more--></p>
<p>In case you’re wondering why I decided to include Salt in the course: it’s used by very large companies around the globe (including CloudFlare where Mircea works) for various operations including cloud provisioning, bringing systems up to a desired configuration, schedule commands, securely transfer files, or coordinate complex multi-systems orchestrations.</p>
<p>In his presentation, Mircea will describe how to get started with Salt and set up an environment for event-driven network automation and orchestration. </p>
<p>Salt cross-platform capabilities are implemented with NAPALM, which we will assume you're already familiar with (it’s covered in details in <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutSol">various self-study sections</a> of the course). We will learn how to install Salt, go through a brief introduction to its CLI syntax, and get to know the advanced configuration management capabilities. </p>
<p>Debugging is always very important - particularly during development, so we will cover this as well, and explore the features Salt provides for debugging.</p>
<p>In the end, we will be briefly discussing event-driven infrastructure that we can use to trigger fully automatic configuration changes in response to external or internal network events.</p>
