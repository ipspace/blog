<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dtaht/">Dave Taht</a> sent me a link to <a href="https://github.com/peteheist/irtt">IRTT</a> after I published a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/11/automate-end-to-end-latency-measurements.html">blog post on measuring end-to-end latency with an Ansible playbook</a>.
