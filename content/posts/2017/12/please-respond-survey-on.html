<p><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2016/10/survey-on-ixp-routing-and-privacy.html">Marco Canini</a> is working on <a href="https://dynam-ix.github.io/">another IXP-related research</a> project and would like to get your feedback on inter-AS interconnection agreements, or as he said in an email he sent me:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">As academics, it would be extremely valuable for us to receive feedback from network operators in the industry.</blockquote>
<p>It’s fantastic to see researchers who want to base their work on real-life experience (as opposed to ideas that <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/10/openflow-and-state-explosion.html">result in great-looking YouTube videos</a> but fail miserably when faced with reality), so if you’re working for an ISP please take a few minutes and <a href="https://goo.gl/bJxJzZ">fill out this survey</a>.</p>
