title: Let’s Pretend We Run Distributed Storage over a Thick Yellow Cable

<p>One of my friends wanted to design a nice-and-easy layer-3 leaf-and-spine fabric for a new data center, and got blindsided by a hyperconverged vendor. Here’s what he wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">We wanted to have a spine/leaf L3 topology for an NSX deployment but can’t do that because the Nutanix servers require L2 between their nodes so they can be in the same cluster.</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to check his claims, but Nutanix doesn’t publish their documentation (I would consider that a <a href="/2015/10/we-need-product-documentation-not-just.html">red flag</a>), so I’m assuming he’s right until someone proves otherwise (note: whitepaper is not a proof of anything ;).<!--more--></p>
<p class="update">Update 2017-11-22: VSAN release 6.6 no longer needs IP multicast.</p>
<p>Anyway, VMware VSAN had the same limitations, then relaxed that to <a href="https://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/products/vsan/vmware-vsan-layer2-and-layer3-network-topologies.pdf">IP multicast within the cluster</a> and finally <a href="https://pubs.vmware.com/Release_Notes/en/vsan/66/vmware-virtual-san-66-release-notes.html">got it right in VSAN release 6.6</a>. Not everyone can upgrade the moment new software releases come out; I happen to know someone who's running NSX (with VXLAN) on top of another layer of VXLAN (on Nexus 9000) just to meet the stupid physical L2 requirements.</p>
<p>Interestingly, at least some comparable open-source solutions work happily without layer-2 connectivity or IP multicast (or you wouldn’t be able to <a href="http://docs.gluster.org/en/latest/Install-Guide/Setup_aws/">deploy them in AWS</a>).</p>
<p>Speaking of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Architectures">leaf-and-spine fabrics</a> and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/VXLAN_Technical_Deep_Dive">VXLAN</a>: hundreds of networking engineers watched webinars describing them in details, and you’ll find tons of background information, designs, and even hands-on exercises in the new <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/FabricDesign">Designing and Building Data Center Fabrics</a> online course. If you want to know whether hyperconverged infrastructure and distributed storage makes sense, there’s no better source than Howard Marks’ presentation from the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">Building Next-Generation Data Center</a> online course.</p>
<p>Back to thick yellow cable devotees. My friend couldn’t help but wonder:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">The overall question would be: why would hyperconverged manufacturers have to rely on L2 to build clusters…?</blockquote>
<p>Because they don't understand networking (or don’t care) and don’t trust DNS? Because they think autodiscovery with IP multicast or proprietary broadcast-like protocols is better than properly configuring storage cluster?</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Their main selling quote is that they are “ahead” of the game with their solution but I only see drawback from a networking standpoint …</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that they don't talk to networking people when selling their solution. Once the solution is sold and the networking engineer asks "<em>what were they smoking when they were designing this stuff</em>" and “<em>why didn’t you involve the networking team before making the purchase” </em>(after taming the <a href="/2013/08/temper-your-macgyver-streak.html">MacGyver reflex</a>), he's the bad guy hindering progress.</p>
