title: Run Well-Designed Experiments to Learn Faster

<p>I know that everyone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles">learns in a slightly different way</a>. Let me share the approach that usually works well for me when a tough topic I’m trying to master includes a practical (hands-on) component: running controlled experiments.</p>
<p>Sounds arcane and purely academic? How about a simple example?</p>
<p class="more">A week ago I talked about this same concept in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions?utm_medium=blog">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course. The video is <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutSol&amp;module=1#M1S4A">already online</a> and you get immediate access to it (and the rest of the course) when you register for the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions?utm_medium=blog#register">next live session</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>A network engineer enrolled into my network automation online course was trying to integrate external Python script with Ansible and asked this question in the course Slack team.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I'm trying to call a Python script from an Ansible task and want to pass the script's result to an Ansible variable (dictionary) in the playbook so I can then loop through it.</blockquote>
<p>I had a pretty good idea how to do it, but wanted to test it first. Here’s how I ran my experiment.</p>
<p class="info">You might not care about Ansible at all, which is perfectly fine. I just needed a real-life example to illustrate my ideas. </p>
<h4>Start in a clean environment</h4><p>Nothing is more frustrating than someone saying “could you take a look at this” and showing you zillion versions of the (almost) same script intermixed with a ton of other irrelevant files.</p>
<p>Start every experiment in a separate (empty) directory. It will make your job easier because you’ll know what you’re working on. You will also get quicker responses when asking for help.</p>
<h4>Reproduce the behavior using a bare minimum of simple components</h4><p>Don’t try to bolt new things onto an existing convoluted script (or playbook) – it will be pretty hard to figure out what’s causing the unexpected behavior, and the experiment might run for a long time before failing.</p>
<p>Having a minimal fast-executing environment results in more controlled experiments, more reliable results, and faster progress.</p>
<p class="note">Do note that this is just the opposite of google-and-paste method favored by some IT practitioners.</p>
<p>It also helps if every component you use is as simple as possible. In my case I decided to:</p>
<ul><li>Create a minimal playbook with a single task that would test how Ansible treats results returned by an external script;</li>
<li>Skip Ansible inventory and use <em>localhost</em>;</li>
<li>Have JSON data in a text file instead of running a Python script (remember: we’re not testing whether the Python script works but how Ansible treats the output).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the Ansible playbook I used:</p>
<pre class="code">---<br/>- hosts: localhost<br/>  gather_facts: no<br/>  tasks:<br/>  - shell: cat data.json<br/>    register: shell_output</pre><p class="info">I knew that I’d have to register the results of the <strong>shell </strong>task as an Ansible fact, but had no idea in what format those results would be.</p>
<p>Here’s my JSON data file:</p>
<pre class="code">{ 'a':'b' }</pre><p><strong>Check your data before running the experiment</strong>. One of the most frustrating experiences you could have is trying to figure out how something works and failing for hours…  only to discover your input data was wrong (or you made a stupid syntax error or…). </p>
<p>If you’re fluent in JSON you might have experienced a facepalm moment while looking at my JSON data. I used <strong>jq </strong>to check it and got this:</p>
<pre class="code">$ jq . data.json<br/>parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 6</pre><p>It makes no sense to progress with your experiment till you have valid input data. A quick check on JSON syntax told me I should have used double quotes (trust me, you can waste hours on a stupidity like this).</p>
<p>Here’s the correct version of my JSON data file:</p>
<pre class="code">{ "a":"b" }</pre><h4>Make small steps</h4><p>Next, I ran the playbook in verbose mode to see what the <strong>shell </strong>module returns:</p>
<pre class="code">$ ansible-playbook pb.yml -v<br/>…<br/><br/>TASK [command] **********************************<br/>changed: [localhost] =&gt; {"changed": true, "cmd": "cat data.json", <br/>  "delta": "0:00:00.003140", "end": "2017-10-04 12:09:43.255971", <br/>  "failed": false, "rc": 0, <br/>  "start": "2017-10-04 12:09:43.252831", <br/>  "stderr": "", "stderr_lines": [], <br/>  "stdout": "{ \"a\":\"b\" }", <br/>  "stdout_lines": ["{ \"a\":\"b\" }"]}</pre><p>It’s pretty obvious that the <strong>shell </strong>module returns a string (<em>stdout</em>) containing whatever the <strong>bash </strong>command has printed. Time to convert that string into parsed data. Fortunately, I could use <strong>from_json</strong> filter in Ansible to do that.</p>
<p>Next version of my playbook:</p>
<pre class="code">---<br/>- hosts: localhost<br/>  gather_facts: no<br/>  tasks:<br/>  - shell: cat data.json<br/>    register: shell_output<br/>  - set_fact: json_data={{shell_output.stdout|from_json}}</pre><p>Running that playbook in <strong>verbose </strong>mode produced something that looked like the data structure I was looking for. Final step: use <strong>debug </strong>to print out the actual value of the <strong>json_data </strong>variable.</p>
<pre class="code">$ ansible-playbook pb.yml<br/>[…]<br/><br/>TASK [debug] ****************************************<br/>ok: [localhost] =&gt; {<br/>    "json_data": {<br/>        "a": "b"<br/>    }<br/>}</pre><h4>Next steps</h4><p>After figuring out how to get JSON data into an Ansible fact, I could explore further:</p>
<ul><li>Use <strong>jq </strong>to check that the Python script returns properly-formatted JSON data;</li>
<li>Replace <strong>cat </strong>with the Python script;</li>
<li>Check that I get the desired data in Ansible;</li>
<li>Use that data in my playbook.</li>
</ul>
