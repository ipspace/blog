<p>Got <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers#Happy_Campers">this feedback</a> on my Ansible for Networking Engineers webinar:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">This webinar is very comprehensive compared to any other Ansible webinars available out there. Ivan does great job of mapping and using real life example which is directly related to daily tasks.</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible online course</a> is even better: it includes support, additional hands-on exercises, sample playbooks, case studies, and lab instructions.</p>
<p>However, Ansible is just a tool that shouldnâ€™t be missing from your toolbox. If you need a bigger picture, consider the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course (and register ASAP to save $700 with the Enthusiast ticket).</p>
