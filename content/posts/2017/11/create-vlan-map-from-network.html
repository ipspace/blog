<p>It’s always great to see students enrolled in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course using ideas from my <a href="https://github.com/ipspace/ansible-examples">sample playbooks</a> to implement a wonderful solution that solves a real-life problem.</p>
<p>James McCutcheon did exactly that: he took my <a href="https://github.com/ipspace/ansible-examples/tree/master/LLDP-to-Graph">LLDP-to-Graph</a> playbook and used it to <a href="https://github.com/kceltyr/net-automation/tree/working/ansible/week2">graph VLANs</a> stretching across multiple switches (and provided a good description of his solution).</p>
