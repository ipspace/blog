<p>Found this Douglas Adams quote in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143125087/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cisioshinandt-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0143125087&amp;linkId=b07756504651ca3ea60463270746dfe9">The Signal and the Noise</a> (a must-read book):</p>
<blockquote class="cite">The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at or repair</blockquote>
<p>Iâ€™ll leave to your imagination how this relates to stretched VLANs, ACI, NSX, VSAN, SD-WAN and a few other technologies.</p>
