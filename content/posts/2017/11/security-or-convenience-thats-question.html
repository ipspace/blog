title: Security or Convenience, That’s the Question

<p>One of my readers was so delighted that <a href="/2017/05/follow-up-nexus-os-dropping.html">something finally happened</a> after I <a href="/2017/04/lets-drop-some-random-commands-shall-we.html">wrote about a NX-OS bug</a> that he sent me a <a href="https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtx68758">pointer to another one</a> that has been pending for a long while, and is now officially terminated as FAD (Functions-as-Designed… even documented in the <em>Further Problem Description</em>).</p>
<p>Here’s what he wrote (slightly reworded)…<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite"><p>The <strong>exec-timeout</strong> configuration is part of the fundamental NX-OS hardening guide that Cisco recommends. However, whenever a <strong>show</strong> command is executed, the timeout is disabled. </p>
<p>The end result: any unfinished <strong>show</strong> command such as <strong>show run </strong>that requires hitting enter to finish (for example, at the <em>more </em>prompt), will cause the console or VTY to stay logged in indefinitely. As NX-OS doesn’t have <strong>absolute-timeout </strong>there’s no workaround. </p>
<p>So if by accident, an engineer disconnects from a console in the middle of a show command, that console will stay logged in forever. </p>
<p>BU was telling me they changed this behavior from IOS because it could "<em>cause incomplete/corrupted output while doing script automated data collection</em>".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me just mention that <strong>exec-timeout </strong>takes <em>number of minutes </em>as its argument, and the recommend value in Cisco’s documentation is “<em>ten or fifteen minutes</em>”. I sincerely hope NX-OS doesn’t take that long to execute a single <strong>show </strong>command, so it’s a bit hard to believe the explanation my reader got.</p>
<p>Anyhow, someone within Cisco decided to prefer convenience over security, and provided a workaround when closing the bug report: “<em>quit to prompt</em>”. Awesome ;)</p>
