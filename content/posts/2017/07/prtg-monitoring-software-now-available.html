<p>One of the more interesting presentations we had during Tech Field Day Extra @ Cisco Live Berlin was coming from Paessler, a company developing PRTG, a little-known network monitoring software.</p>
<p>More about PRTG in <a href="http://techfieldday.com/companies/paessler/">TFD videos</a> and <a href="https://overlaid.net/2016/10/19/my-thoughts-on-paessler-may-surprise-you/">here</a>, <a href="http://blog.linoproject.net/tfdx-extra-vmworld-2016-europe-network-monitoring-with-prtg/">here</a>, <a href="https://blog.packet-foo.com/2017/06/a-look-at-paessler-prtg/">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.vgeek.it/2016/10/26/paessler-prtg-overview-at-tech-field-day-extra-vmworld-europe-2016/">here</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>Anyway, there’s a reason I’m writing about them: Paessler decided to do the right thing and started offering PRTG as a SaaS service running in Amazon cloud.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://www.my-prtg.com/home">their cloud service</a> is in beta and offers 10-day free trials, so if you’re looking for an alternate network monitoring/management tool it might be worth checking out.</p>
