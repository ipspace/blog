title: New in Ansible for Networking Engineers
url: /2017/07/new-in-ansible-for-networking-engineers/
---

<p>Here’s the list of materials (and other changes) I added to the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible for Networking Engineers</a> webinar and online course in June 2017.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll notice is the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Ansible">brand-new user interface with collapsible sections</a>, making it easier to grasp the big picture (the change was badly needed – the webinar is already almost 12 hours long).<!--more--></p>
<p>Next, I started adding review questions and hands-on exercises. YAML, Jinja2 and baseline Ansible sections already have them. I also published the solutions for YAML and Jinja2 sections. Next on the list: networking modules.</p>
<p>Speaking of networking modules: I updated the <em>Introduction </em>section and added a brand-new <em>Connecting to Network Devices and Authenticating </em>section that covers the old (Ansible 2.1 – 2.2) and new (Ansible 2.3+) mechanisms.</p>
<p>I started using the <strong>assemble </strong>module in many of my playbooks to create device configurations or summary reports, so I added a detailed explanation of how I use it to <em>Working with Files </em>video in <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Ansible#ANSIBLE_DD"><em>Ansible Deeper Dive</em></a><em> </em>section.</p>
<p>Finally, I put together a <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Ansible#SAMPLES">list of useful Ansible playbooks</a> I created during the last 2 years (available in webinar and online course), and started adding detailed explanations (online course only).</p>
<p>Planned for the next few weeks:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Review questions and hands-on exercises for networking modules, and <em>extending Ansible </em>and <em>creating reusable code </em>sections.</li>
<li>More case study explanations (online course only)</li>
</ul>
<p>Longer term plans: testing and debugging (online course only)</p>
