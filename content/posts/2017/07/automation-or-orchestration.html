title: Automation or Orchestration?

<p>Have you ever wondered what the difference between <em>automation </em>and <em>orchestration </em>is? </p>
<p>Wikipedia defines <em>automation </em>as <em>use of various control systems for operating equipment</em>. The definition I prefer (because it’s easier to understand in network automation environment) is <em>elimination of well-defined repeatable manual tasks</em> – the emphasis being on <em>well-defined </em>and <em>repeatable</em>.<!--more--></p>
<p>What about <em>orchestration</em>? According to Wikipedia, it’s <em>automated arrangement, coordination, and management</em> that <em>defines the policies and service levels through automated workflows, provisioning, and change management</em>. Yet again, a simpler definition might make more sense: <em>grouping of automated tasks in coordinated workflows</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s make this a bit less abstract:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Enabling an interface? Automation.</li>
<li>Configuring a VLAN on a switch? Automation.</li>
<li>Creating interface descriptions based on LLDP neighbors? Automation.</li>
<li>Creating a VLAN service by enabling edge interfaces, configuring access VLANs, creating VLAN-to-VXLAN mappings, and testing the end-to-end connectivity? Orchestration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively (for a more down-to-earth example): </p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Squeezing grapes = automation</li>
<li>Making wine = orchestration</li>
</ul>
<p>Makes sense?</p>
<h4>More information</h4><ul class="BulletList"><li>I was talking about the difference between the two in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Network_Automation_101">Network Automation 101</a> webinar (also part of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible for Networking Engineers</a> online course), and in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course. </li>
<li>The Building Network Automation Solutions online course also includes a pretty comprehensive “how do I get started” section that you might find useful if you’re trying to migrate from being a CLI jockey to becoming an automation-focused engineer.</li>
