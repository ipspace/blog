<p>One of my readers sent me an email that’s easiest paraphrased into: “<em>Why can’t I have a different IPv6 link-local address </em><em>(LLA) </em><em>on every access port connected to a VLAN interface?</em>”</p>
<p>There’s probably nothing stopping someone from implementing such an approach, but it would go against the usual understanding of how bridging and routing interact in L2+L3 switches.<!--more--></p>
<h4>What Is a VLAN Interface?</h4><p>A VLAN interface is nothing more than a routed (L3) virtual interface connected to a bridge domain (VLAN). Regardless of how this construct is implemented in hardware or software, it should look like a router connected to a bridge, or (ignoring optimizations in frame forwarding) a router connected to an Ethernet cable.</p>
<h4>What MAC Address Should a VLAN Interface Use?</h4><p>Every L3 interface (including a VLAN interface) potentially participating in the same L2 domain should have a unique L2 (MAC) address, which means that a L2+L3 switch needs a unique MAC address for each of its physical interfaces (because each physical interface could be turned into a L3 interface). You can usually see those addresses (<strong>bia </strong>or <strong>burned-in-address) </strong>in <strong>show interfaces </strong>printout.</p>
<p class="info">A bridge (remarketed as a L2 switch) does not need a unique MAC address on every interface. All it needs is a single MAC address to send BPDUs (and other control-plane messages) from.</p>
<p>A VLAN interface could (theoretically) reuse a MAC address of a physical interface (in case the physical interface has a separate burned-in-address), or use a MAC address from a pool of addresses assigned by the vendor to the switch itself… but in most cases, the implementation details don’t really matter, as the MAC addresses have to be unique <em>within </em>a single L2 domain.</p>
<p class="warn">Stretching L2 domains or merging multiple L2 domains into a single transport domain with Q-in-Q encapsulation can lead to interesting results as some people trying to use the same HSRP group on multiple stretched VLANs found out the hard way.</p>
<h4>Coming Back to IPv6 LLA</h4><p>An IPv6 interface is usually assigned a single IPv6 LLA. A VLAN interface thus gets a single IPv6 LLA.</p>
<p>Physical access ports connected to a VLAN instance are not L3 ports, and thus don’t get a L3 address. Quite often they don’t even need a L2 address (see above).</p>
<p>You could assign numerous LLA to a VLAN interface (one per physical port), but they’d have to be bound to VLAN interface (not physical ports) anyway to retain the semantics of VLAN interface, so why bother.</p>
<p>Interestingly, based on <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/v6ops/current/msg26836.html">recent discussions on one of the IPv6 mailing lists</a> (where you’ll also find other interesting tidbits), it looks like some vendors decided to move in the opposite direction: they use the same IPv6 LLA on all IPv6 interfaces present in a network device. Yet again, that shouldn’t be a problem (after all, LLA are supposed to be unique only within a single L2 domain) until you’re forced to connect two IPv6 interfaces back-to-back to implement whatever design not supported by the underlying hardware (Nexus 7000 comes to mind ;).</p>
