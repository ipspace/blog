There are two reasonable ways of building a layer-2 leaf-and-spine fabric: use VXLAN (the direction almost everyone in the industry is taking at the moment), or routing-on-layer-2 technology like TRILL or SPB.

Only a few vendors decided to use SPB to build data center fabrics, and Roger Lapuh from Avaya was kind enough to [explain how you can do that](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Clos/7.48%20-%20Building%20Data%20Center%20Fabrics%20with%20SPB.mp4) during the [Leaf-and-Spine Fabric Architectures](http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Architectures) webinar (for more details on SPB, see also [SPB Deep Dive video](/2017/03/video-spb-deep-dive/) from the same webinar).
