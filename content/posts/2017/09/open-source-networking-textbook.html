<p>A month ago I told you how dr. Olivier Bonaventure <a href="/2017/08/teach-ipv6-first-and-automate-deployment.html">starts his networking course with IPv6</a>. But there’s more: the full textbook for the undergraduate course (<a href="http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be/index.html">Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols and Practice</a>) is open-sourced and available (in source form) on <a href="https://github.com/obonaventure/cnp3">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>You might wonder why I’m so enthusiastic, so let me tell you another story…<!--more--></p>
<p>A while ago I was approached by someone who’s working with a traditional publisher to put together a network automation book. I checked the publisher’s web site and found out that it’s one of those institutions charging $150 for a textbook, so of course I politely asked how much the authors get out of that. Here’s the deal:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">The publisher is following the BCP for edited books; a complimentary copy of the book upon publication will be provided to lead authors.</blockquote>
<p>I politely declined the invitation and asked to be notified when they’ll be working on a free open-source book ;)</p>
