title: Self-Driving Networks with Kireeti Kompella

<p>A while ago I got a kind email from Kireeti Kompella, CTO @ Juniper Networks, saying “<em>A colleague sent me an email of yours regarding SDN, the trough of disillusionment, and the rise of automation. Here's a more dramatic view: the Self-Driving Network -- one whose operation is totally automated.</em>” </p>
