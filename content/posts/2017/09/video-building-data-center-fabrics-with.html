<p>There are two reasonable ways of building a layer-2 leaf-and-spine fabric: use VXLAN (the direction almost everyone in the industry is taking at the moment), or routing-on-layer-2 technology like TRILL or SPB.<!--more--></p>
<p>Only a few vendors decided to use SPB to build data center fabrics, and Roger Lapuh from Avaya was kind enough to <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Clos/7.48 - Building Data Center Fabrics with SPB.mp4">explain how you can do that</a> during the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Architectures">Leaf-and-Spine Fabric Architectures</a> webinar (for more details on SPB, see also <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/03/video-spb-deep-dive.html">SPB Deep Dive video</a> from the same webinar).</p>
