<p>An update of PERL libraries broke a number of my scripts (don't ask). Here's the current status:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed: credit card processing. It was impossible to buy products from ipSpace.net with credit cards (the credit card form didn't appear at all)</li>
<li>Fixed: Google+ login</li>
<li>Unrelated and fixed: blog search</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything else not working? Please write a comment or send me an email. Thank you!</p>
