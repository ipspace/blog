<p>Joel Knight published his <a href="https://www.packetmischief.ca/2017/08/29/how-ive-attempted-to-blog-more-in-2017/">blogging toolkit and processes he uses to write blog posts</a>. Definitely worth reading even if you never plan to blog as he nicely documents how to sync creative process across multiple platforms.</p>
