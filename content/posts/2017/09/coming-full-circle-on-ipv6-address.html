<p>In the <a href="http://packetpushers.net/podcast/podcasts/show-354-future-networking-fred-baker/">Future of Networking with Fred Baker</a> Fred mentioned an interesting IPv6 deployment scenario: give a /64 prefix to every server to support container deployment, and run routing protocols between servers and ToR switches to advertise the /64 prefix to the data center fabric preferably using link-local addresses.</p>
<p>Let’s recap:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>We just turned 128-bit IPv6 addresses into 64-bit endpoint identifiers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="more">Do I have to mention that the original IPv6 proposal had 64-bit addresses, and they added the extra 64 bits to support IPX-style auto-configuration?</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Endpoint address is assigned to a node, not to an interface.</li>
<li>Endpoints use a node-to-router protocol to advertise their endpoint address.</li>
<li>All routers within a domain advertise individual endpoint addresses.</li>
<li>Endpoint addresses are summarized into a larger prefix at the routing domain boundary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hooray, yet again we <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/05/reinventing-clns-with-l3-only-forwarding.html">reinvented CLNP</a>. We might have <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2010/12/clnp-and-multihoming-myths.html">used it 25 years ago</a> instead of <a href="http://www.ionary.com/ion-ipv6.html">inventing a new protocol</a>.</p>
