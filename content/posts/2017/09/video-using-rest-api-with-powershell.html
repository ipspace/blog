<p>In the third part of his <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/PowerShell_for_Networking_Engineers">PowerShell for Networking Engineers</a> Mitja Robas described how to <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/PowerShell/2 - Using REST API with PowerShell.mp4">use built-in PowerShell functionality</a> to work with devices that have REST API, and showed how you can manage and configure Nexus OS switches with PowerShell. He also <a href="https://github.com/1mrobas/PowerShell-for-Networking-Engineers-20170213">published the source code for all his examples on GitHub</a>.</p>
