<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>One of my readers considered joining the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> course but wasn’t sure whether it would help him solve the challenges he’s facing in his network.</p>
<p>Fortunately, his challenges aren’t that hard to solve.<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite">I want to manage the Tacacs and/or Radius keys on all the devices in an automated fashion.</blockquote>
<p>Easy. The basics are explained in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible for Networking Engineers</a> webinar, and we’re covering all aspects of this challenge (including cleanup of old configuration) in <a href="http://automation.ipspace.net/Public:4-Changing_Network_Configurations_or_State">Week#4</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I want to manage the SNMP community strings in an automated fashion.</blockquote>
<p>Same as above… unless he’s using SNMPv3. Cisco IOS doesn’t store SNMPv3 credentials in the configuration file, so he’d need a combination of <strong>show </strong>and <strong>config </strong>commands. </p>
<p>Getting data from a device is explained in details in the <em>Ansible Networking Modules – Executing Commands </em>section of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible for Networking Engineers</a>, and the whole <a href="http://automation.ipspace.net/Public:2-Easy_Wins">Week 2</a> of the online course is dedicated to gathering information from networking devices and acting on it.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I want to manage the tacacs, radius, ntp, snmp hosts in an automated fashion.</blockquote>
<p>The simplest of them all. Examples are in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible for Networking Engineers</a> webinar and <a href="https://github.com/ipspace/NetOpsWorkshop">Network Automation Workshop GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I want to manage the local user accounts and password in an automated fashion.</blockquote>
<p>Not a problem (there are examples doing exactly that in Jinja2 part of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible for Networking Engineers</a> webinar), but he’d probably have to implement an additional cleanup step (covered in Week#4 of the online course).</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I do want to check the configs of the devices for the settings above and compare that to what I have on file in a DB.</blockquote>
<p>Covered in Week#2 of the course. Integration with external databases will be covered in <a href="http://automation.ipspace.net/Public:6-Putting_It_All_Together">Week#6</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">If they are out of sync I want to report and then offer the option to remediate in an automated fashion.</blockquote>
<p>I actually have a <a href="https://github.com/ipspace/ansible-examples/tree/master/Sample-Compliance-Check">playbook</a> doing exactly that ;)… well, not the remediation part.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Environment: Legacy Cisco IOS, NX-OS, IOS-XE, IOS-XR</blockquote>
<p>You’re free to choose the platforms you’ll work on during the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> course, and while most of my future examples will be based on vEOS or Cumulus Linux (because <a href="/2017/04/lets-drop-some-random-commands-shall-we.html">bloatware</a>), most students use IOS or NX-OS in their labs (realities of life).</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I have experience with expect scripts to do batch tasks. I know the newer Cisco operating systems have Python support.</blockquote>
<p>We're not using that. We're using Ansible because it doesn't require anything on the network devices.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">My challenge is that I feel that my use case is one of "scripting" and not necessarily "automation".</blockquote>
<p>Terminology ;)</p>
<p><strong>Automation</strong> is the use of various control systems for operating equipment […] with minimal or reduced human intervention. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation">source</a>)</p>
<p>A <strong>scripting</strong> or script language is a programming language that supports scripts; programs written for a special run-time environment that automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">source</a>)</p>
