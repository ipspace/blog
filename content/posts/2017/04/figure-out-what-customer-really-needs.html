<p>One of the toughest challenges you can face as a networking engineer is trying to understand what the customer really needs (as opposed to what they think they’re telling you they want).</p>
<p>For example, the server team comes to you saying “<em>we need 5 VLANs between these 3 data centers</em>”. What do you do?<!--more--></p>
<p>The correct approach is to figure out what problem they’re trying to solve, work with them to understand the limitations (from application architecture, database setup, storage replication…) and finally propose a solution that’s close enough to what they think they need but doesn’t compromise the network stability.</p>
<p>To do that, you have to understand a bit about the application architectures, and that’s what I’ve tried to explain in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Designing_Active-Active_and_Disaster_Recovery_Data_Centers"><em>Designing Active-Active and Disaster Recovery Data Centers</em></a> webinar and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Webinars">numerous other webinars</a>, as well as in the <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/Scalable">university course I’ve been teaching</a>.</p>
<p>I can’t tell you how delighted I was when I received this email from one of the engineers watching my webinar:</p>
<blockquote class="cite"><p style="margin-bottom: 1em">We have a customer and he wanted to migrate his application from active-DR(manual) into active-active or active-active-active and introduce cross-DC load balancing and VLANs everywhere.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">So I used the information and guidance based on your webinar to stop this approach (for now, waiting for answer to my feedback) and hopefully it will be changed to proper swimlanes in each DC and DB replication based on their requirements.</p>
<p>So the webinar was very useful, full of ideas and recommendation, and I am satisfied and happy because it helped me in real life. But fight is not finished yet…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can only wish him luck ;)</p>
