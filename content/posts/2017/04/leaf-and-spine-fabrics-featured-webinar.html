<p>I recently finished editing the videos from the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Designs">Leaf-and-Spine Designs</a> update to the <a href="http://ipspace.net/Clos">Leaf-and-Spine Fabrics</a> webinar, so it wasn’t hard to select the featured webinar for April 2017. The featured videos now include <em>BGP in the Data Center</em> by Dinesh Dutt, <em>SPB Deep Dive</em> by Roger Lapuh, and <em>VXLAN with EVPN control plane</em> by Lukas Krattiger.<!--more--></p>
