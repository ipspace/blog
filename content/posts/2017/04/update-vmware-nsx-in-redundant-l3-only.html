<p>Short update for those that read the original blog post: it turns out that the answer to the question “<em>I</em><em>s it possible to run VMware NSX on redundantly-connected hosts in a pure L3 data center fabric?</em>” is still <strong>NO</strong>.</p>
<p>VTEPs from different ESXi hosts can be in different subnets, but while a single ESXi host might have multiple VTEPs, the only supported way to use them is to put them in the same subnet. I removed the original blog post.</p>
<p>A huge thank you to everyone who pushed me with their comments and emails to find the correct answer.</p>
