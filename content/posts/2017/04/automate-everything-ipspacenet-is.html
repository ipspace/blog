<p>After the last US-based ipSpace.net workshop a lot of people asked me about the next one. It took a long time, but here it is: I’m running an <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/automate-everything-nil-ipspace-joint-network-automation-3-day-workshop-registration-32915518201?utm_source=ipspace">on-site automation workshop</a> together with several friends with outstanding hands-on experience in Colorado in late May.<!--more--></p>
<p>When planning the event, we decided to make it as hands-on as possible, and include as many popular products and technologies as feasible. Here’s what we’ll do in the hands-on part of the workshop:</p>
<ul><li>Mitja Robas, the author of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/PowerShell_for_Networking_Engineers">PowerShell for Networking engineers</a>, will show how you can automate VMware NSX, EVPN network built with Cisco Nexus 9000, UCS infrastructure and even Pure storage arrays. He’ll conclude his part with a full-blown multi-data-center example and integrate his scripts with VMware vRealize.</li>
</ul>
<p class="info">Mitja also has production Cisco ACI experience, and I’m positive you’ll have interesting evening discussions with him.</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.nil.com/en/about/teams/bostjan-sustar/">Boštjan Šuštar</a> has been developing and deploying solutions based on Cisco NSO for the last few years (you might remember the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/02/hands-on-tail-f-experience-on-software.html">podcast I did with him a while ago</a>). He’ll show you how to deploy layer-2 MPLS/VPN service with Cisco NSO as the orchestrator using NETCONF and REST API on network devices.</li>
<li>Finally, I’ll focus on the power of open-source tools and we’ll have some quality time with Git, GitHub, and Ansible.</li>
</ul>
