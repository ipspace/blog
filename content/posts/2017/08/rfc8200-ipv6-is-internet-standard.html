<p>You wouldn’t believe it – after almost 22 years (yeah, it’s been that long since <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1883">RFC 1883</a> was published), IPv6 became an <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/standards">Internet standard</a> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8200">RFC8200/STD86</a>). No wonder some people claim IETF moves at glacial speed ;)</p>
<p>Speaking of IPv6, IETF and glacial speeds – there’s been a <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/v6ops/current/msg26886.html">hilarious thread</a> before Prague IETF meeting heatedly arguing whether the default WLAN SSID should be IPv6-only (+NAT64). Definitely worth reading (for the entertainment value) over a beer or two.</p>
