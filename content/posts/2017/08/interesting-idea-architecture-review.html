<p>John Allspaw wrote an <a href="https://www.kitchensoap.com/2017/08/12/multiple-perspectives-on-technical-problems-and-solutions/">interesting blog post</a> describing how he dealt with requests to introduce new technologies or design patterns. While heâ€™s writing from the software development perspective, the ideas apply equally well to network architecture, so go and read what he has to say (and how he defines what <em>engineering method </em>is).</p>
