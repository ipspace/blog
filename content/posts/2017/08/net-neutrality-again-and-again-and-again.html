<p><em>Net neutrality</em> is one of those topics that should never have existed, but of course it inevitably erupts every so often, so here we go…</p>
<p>Not so long ago <a href="https://twitter.com/erratarob">Robert Graham</a> published his <a href="http://blog.erratasec.com/2017/07/defending-anti-netneutrality-arguments.html">anti-net-neutrality arguments</a> which are (no surprise) not much different from what I wrote when I still cared about this argument (<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/06/internet-socialism-all-i-can-eat.html">here</a>, <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2009/07/followup-all-i-can-eat.html">here</a>, <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2010/07/p2p-traffic-is-bad-for-network.html">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2010/07/p2p-traffic-and-internet-part-2.html">here</a>). While I agree with his overall perspective, I completely disagree with his view of Comcast’s initial response to network congestion.<!--more--></p>
<p>A brief recap of the facts (as I remember them):</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Bittorent users totally congested Comcast’s cable network(s);</li>
<li>Comcast responded by inspecting user traffic (bad) and sending spoofed TCP RST messages (really bad) to make Bittorent unusable;</li>
<li>Not surprisingly, they didn’t want to admit they were doing it till they were caught red-handed.</li>
</ul>
<p>After all the brouhaha that fueled the whole Net Neutrality argument (thank you, Comcast) and FCC getting involved, Comcast finally implemented what they should have done in the first place: throttling <em>all traffic</em> of high-volume users during network congestion periods <em>and </em>making their behavior public and well document (it’s described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6057">RFC 6057</a>).</p>
<p>As for the other grudge Robert has with Comcast (data caps): as I <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/06/need-for-internet-data-caps.html">wrote in 2010</a>, there are two ways to deal with users generating significantly more traffic than the average.</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>You can identify and throttle/police them (what a user-friendly ISP would do);</li>
<li>You can try to squeeze more money out of them (what most other ISPs are doing).</li>
</ul>
