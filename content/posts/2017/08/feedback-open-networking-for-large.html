<p>Got this feedback from a network architect attending the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Open_Networking_for_Large-Scale_Networks"><em>Open Networking for Large-Scale Networks</em></a> webinar:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I used the webinar when preparing for a meeting/discussion with a NOS SW-vendor. In the meeting, my knowledge was completely up-to-speed &amp; I was on the level with the vendor in the discussion! :-)</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/riw777/">Russ White</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/szandi/">Shawn Zandi</a> did a great job based on their real-life hands-on experience (they use whitebox switches @ LinkedIn).</p>
