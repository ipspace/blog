<p>During Cisco Live Berlin 2017 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/petergjones/">Peter Jones</a> (chair of several IEEE task forces) and myself went on a journey through 40 years of Ethernet history (and Token Bus and a few other choice technologies).</p>
<p>The sound quality is what you could expect from something recorded on a show floor with pigeons flying around, but I hope youâ€™ll still enjoy our chat.</p>
