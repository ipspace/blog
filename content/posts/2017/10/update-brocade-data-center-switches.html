<p>Second vendor in <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2017/10/update-arista-data-center-switches.html">this year’s series of data center switching updates</a>: Brocade.</p>
<p>Not much has happened on this front since last year’s update. There was a maintenance release of Brocade NOS, they launched SLX series of switches, but those are so new that the software documentation didn’t have time to make it to the usual place (document library for individual switch models), it's <a href="http://www.brocade.com/en/support/document-library/dl-segment-products-os-detail-page.slxos.os.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>In any case, the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DCFabric#BROCADE">updated videos</a> (including edited 2016 content which describes IP Fabric in great details) are online. You can access them if you bought the webinar recording in the past or if you have an active <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">ipSpace.net subscription</a>.</p>
