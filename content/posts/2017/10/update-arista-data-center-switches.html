<p>In the past 5+ years I ran at least one <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics_Update"><em>Data Center Fabrics Update</em></a> webinar per year to cover new hardware and software launched by data center switching vendors.</p>
<p>The rate of product and feature launches in data center switching market is slowing down, so I decided to insert the information on new hardware and software features launched in 2017 directly into the merged videos describing the progress various vendors made in the last years.</p>
<p>First in line: <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DCFabric#ARISTA">Arista EOS</a>. You can access the videos if you bought the webinar recording in the past or if you have an active <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">ipSpace.net subscription</a>.</p>
