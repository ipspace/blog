Sometimes I have this weird feeling that I'm the only loony in town desperately preaching against the [stupidities heaped upon infrastructure](http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/this-is-what-makes-networking-so-complex.html), so it's really nice when I find a fellow lost soul. This is what another senior networking engineer sent me:

> I\'m belonging to a small group of people who are thinking that the source of the problem are the apps and the associated business/security rules: their nature, their complexity, their lifecycle\...

Sounds familiar (I probably wrote a [few blog posts](http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/11/typical-enterprise-application.html) on this topic in the past), and it only got better.

Amen.

Not surprisingly, some vendors vigorously disagree, particularly if they're selling the Aspirin to reduce the headaches of "traditional" app brokenness. On a more optimistic front, even engineers working for said vendors [sometimes see the light](http://www.it20.info/2014/12/cloud-native-applications-for-dummies/)... and eventually [move on](http://www.it20.info/2017/09/so-long-vmware-hello-aws/).

Some network engineers found my [*Designing Active-Active and Disaster Recovery Data Centers*](http://www.ipspace.net/Designing_Active-Active_and_Disaster_Recovery_Data_Centers) webinar pretty useful when trying to persuade everyone else not to implement vendor marketectures.
