title: Upgrading Virtual Appliances

<p>In every <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Software_Defined_Data_Centers_(SDDC)_Workshop">SDDC workshop</a> I tried to persuade the audience that the virtual appliances (particularly per-application instances of virtual appliances) are the way to go. I usually got the questions along the lines of “who will manage and audit all these instances?” but once someone asked “and how will we upgrade them?”</p>
<p>Short answer: you won’t.<!--more--></p>
<p>The beauty of running virtual machines is that it’s easy to destroy them and create new ones, so here’s how I would upgrade my virtual appliances (anyone vaguely familiar with properly-deployed cloud-based applications will immediately recognize the pattern):</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Build a new VM template from the new software distribution (assuming the vendor doesn’t supply the appliance in a ready-to-use format);</li>
<li>Start the new VM in test environment and copy the current configuration into the new virtual machine. </li>
</ul>
<p class="info">In the ideal world, the appliance would fetch its configuration from a central database resulting in a completely stateless setup, but we’re not there yet.</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Stress-test the new VM (you do have unit tests verifying whatever your appliance should be doing, right?)</li>
<li>When you’re ready for the change, disconnect the current appliance VM from the network and connect the VM with upgraded software (and identical configuration) to the network.</li>
<li>If the new software crashes (because $vendor QA) disconnect the new VM and reconnect the old one.</li>
<li>Once you’ve mastered all the steps, automate the process.</li>
</ul>
