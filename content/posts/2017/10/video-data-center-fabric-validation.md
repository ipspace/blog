Validating the expected network behavior is (according to the intent-driven pundits) a fundamental difference that makes intent-driven products more than [glorified orchestration systems](/2017/09/intent-based-hype.html).

Guess what: smart people knew that for ages and validated their deployments even when using simple tools like Ansible playbooks.

Dinesh Dutt explained how he [validates data center fabric deployment](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/NetAutUC/3.3%20-%20Validation.mp4) during the [Network Automation Use Cases](http://www.ipspace.net/Network_Automation_Use_Cases) webinar; I'm doing something similar in my [OSPF deployment playbooks](https://github.com/ipspace/ansible-examples/tree/master/OSPF-Deployment) ([described in detail](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=AnsibleOC#WAN_SVC_CS) in [Ansible online course](http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers)).
