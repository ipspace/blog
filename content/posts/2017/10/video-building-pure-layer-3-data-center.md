One of the design scenarios we covered in [*Leaf-and-Spine Fabric Architectures*](http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Architectures) webinar is a pure layer-3 data center, and in the "how do I do this" part of that section Dinesh Dutt [talked about the details you need to know](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Clos/7.25%20-%20Building%20a%20Pure%20L3%20Data%20Center%20with%20Cumulus%20Linux.mp4) to get this idea implemented on Cumulus Linux.

We covered a [half-dozen design scenarios](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Clos) in that webinar; for an even wider picture check out the new [Designing and Building Data Center Fabrics](http://www.ipspace.net/FabricDesign) online course.
