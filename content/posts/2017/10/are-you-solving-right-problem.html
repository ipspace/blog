title: Are You Solving the Right Problem?

<p>With all the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2017/09/intent-based-hype.html">intent-based hype</a> (and the previous <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/02/so-what-exactly-is-sdn.html">SDN-will-rule-the-world-hype</a>) you’d think that the network is the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/07/why-is-every-sdn-vendor-bashing.html">ultimate ossified roadblock</a> on the path to agile nirvana.</p>
<p>You’d be totally wrong (and you’d deserve it – never trust a vendor peddling a product).</p>
<p>Here’s an amazing discovery I made when I was still running on-site <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN,_OpenFlow_and_NFV_Workshop">SDN</a> and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Hands-On_Network_Automation">network automation workshops</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p class="more">Speaking of network automation workshops: I mostly replaced them with the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">network automation online course</a> and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Roadmap/Network_Automation_webinars">network automation webinar track</a>, but if you really want to attend an on-site event I’ll be <a href="https://reissromoli.com/sem_2017/en/site">running one in Rome in October 2017</a> and probably another one at <a href="https://www.troopers.de/">Troopers 18</a>.</p>
<p>I always started them with “<em>what do you think is the biggest obstacle in your IT and how would you automate that?”</em>, and once I got this reply from someone whose perspective was slightly larger than just networking:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">If only we could deploy VMs faster. It takes a month to get a new VM because so many teams (server, storage, security, backup, AD, monitoring…) have to touch it. How could we automate that process?</blockquote>
<p><strong>Lesson learned</strong>: figure out what your most pressing problem is. Contrary to what the vendors claim, it might not be the network.</p>
<p><strong>Next step</strong>: follow the 80-20 rule and fix the first 20% of the problems you have. They are usually the easiest to fix, and might result in biggest payoffs.</p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong>: sometimes <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/11/typical-enterprise-application.html">it’s the process, not the technology</a>. You’ll <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/09/youve-been-doing-same-thing-for-last-20.html">never fix a broken process by replacing it with technology</a>, all you’ll get will be a technology-assisted broken process.</p>
<p><strong>Also</strong>: replacing whole teams with technology sounds great if you hate dealing with pesky underlings, but you’re just replacing your team (example: network engineers) whose only focus should be the well-being of your company, with someone else’s team (example: programmers working for an intent-driven vendor) whose focus is completely different (example: generating revenues for the vendor). Why do you think that would give you better results?</p>
