<p>I love reading well-argued contrarian views, and <a href="http://www.circleid.com/posts/20170905_an_opinion_in_defence_of_nats/">Geoff Huston’s Opinion in Defense of NAT</a> is definitely worth the time it will take you to read it.</p>
<p>TL&amp;DR: Geoff argues that with all the wastage going on in IPv6 land (most bizarre: let’s give a /48 to every residential subscriber) the number of bits available for IPv6 endpoint addressing gets close to what we can squeeze out of IPv4 NAT.</p>
