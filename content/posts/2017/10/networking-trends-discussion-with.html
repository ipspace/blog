<p>In June 2017, we concluded the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">Building Next Generation Data Center</a> online course with a roundtable discussion with Andrew Lerner, Research Vice President, Networking, and Simon Richard, Research Director, Data Center Networking @ Gartner.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_83-Networking_Trends_with_Gartner_-_Part_2.mp3">second half of our discussion</a> (first half is <a href="/2017/09/networking-trends-discussion-with.html">here</a>) we focused on these topics:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>How do you move from a single central box (load balancer or firewall) to a more distributed and resilient architecture?</li>
<li>How do we move from the overly large L2 domains so popular in some data center environments toward a more sane and resilient network architecture?</li>
<li>Does VXLAN help to reduce the layer-2 failure domains?</li>
<li>Have we started moving from high availability implemented within the infrastructure to highly-available application architectures?</li>
<li>Does vMotion between data centers make sense? Where?</li>
<li>What happened to SDN and whitebox switches?</li>
<li>Does the pure SDN architecture make sense?</li>
<li>Who is using whitebox or britebox switches?</li>
<li>What software are the whitebox customers deploying?</li>
<li>How much could you save with whitebox switches?</li>
<li>Is anyone running containers in production?</li>
<li>How do you get a container system that’s fit for production use?</li>
</ul>
