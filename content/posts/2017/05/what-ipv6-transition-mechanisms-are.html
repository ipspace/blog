<p>An engineer watching my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_Transition_Mechanisms">IPv6 Transition Mechanisms</a> webinar sent me this question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">We would appreciate any insight you might have as to which transitional mechanisms the ISPs are actually deploying.</blockquote>
<p>All of them ;)<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><a name="_GoBack"></a>It started with 6rd used by ISPs who could not upgrade the access network to IPv6.</li>
<li>I’ve seen plenty of ISPs using DS-Lite or CG-NAT.</li>
</ul>
<p class="warn">IPv4-to-IPv4 CG-NAT is should be the hack-of-last-resort <del>for people who believe they cannot roll out IPv6 for whatever reason</del>. Please try to do anything else but this.  See also Lindsay's comment below.</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Some use MAP-T or variants with table-based mapping for address/port ranges into IPv6 endpoints (example: Deutsche Telekom). There are open-source products out there <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2016/03/x86-based-switching-at-ludicrous-speed.html">translating 20Gbps of MAP-T traffic <em>per x86 core</em></a>.</li>
<li>Some mobile operators are deploying IPv6-only networks and using NAT64 (+464xlat) to get to IPv4-only content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have I missed anything? Please write a comment!</p>
