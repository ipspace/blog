<p>I keep getting questions along the lines of “<em>should I go with VMware NSX or should I deploy Cisco ACI</em>” every single week, and as you know it’s hard to answer anything but <em>it depends </em>without spending hours on the topic.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what we plan to do in Zurich next Tuesday (May 16<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span>) in a <a href="http://www.digs.ch/digs-workshop-evpn/">DIGS workshop</a> that will run in parallel with the Data Center &amp; Cloud Day (part of the <a href="http://www.sig-switzerland.ch/technology_conference/">SIGS Technology Conference</a>).<!--more--></p>
<p>You’ll be able to attend all the DC Day keynotes (including the one I’ll run with <a href="/2016/04/palo-alto-integration-with-cisco-aci/">Christer Swartz</a>), exchange ideas with other attendees, and hopefully get more visibility into why or when it would make sense to use NSX or ACI.</p>
<p>To make the discussion as relevant as possible, I invited <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Author:Mitja_Robas">Mitja Robas</a> to be the co-presenter in the workshop. He deployed NSX, EVPN on Cisco Nexus 9000, and Cisco ACI in production, and gathered plenty of don’t-do-that lessons in the process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some companies won’t allow their engineers to discuss their challenges in public. If that’s the case, and you're based in Central Europe, we could set up an onsite workshop… or you could attend the public workshop in Zurich to get a wider perspective, and then we’d do a follow-up one with your team.</p>
