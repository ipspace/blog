<p>The spring craziness is still in full swing – we’ll have three webinars this week (a first) and I was so busy I didn’t even have time to write about them. Let’s fix that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_3.0_Updates"><strong>Data Center Updates</strong></a> on Monday is the second part of <em>server virtualization, virtual machines and containers </em>update to <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_3.0_for_Networking_Engineers">Data Center 3.0 webinar</a>. We covered virtual machines in the last session (April 25<sup>th</sup>), this time we’ll talk about containers.</p>
<p>David Barroso (now at Fastly) will talk about <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_Updates"><strong>NAPALM in Ansible</strong></a> on Tuesday.<!--more--> His webinar is part of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible for Networking Engineers webinar</a> and will focus on NAPALM-within-Ansible. Make sure you go through the introductory parts of that webinar before the live session.</p>
<p>Shawn Zandi (LinkedIn) will talk about <strong>single-SKU data center networks</strong> in the second part of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Open_Networking_for_Large-Scale_Networks">Open Networking for Large-Scale Networks</a> webinar. Yet again, I’d recommend you watch the first part of the webinar covering whitebox switching, disaggregation, and network operating systems before attending the sessions.</p>
<p>Long-time users know how the ipSpace.net webinars work, for everyone else here are a few more details:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>When you register for an update session or any session of a multi-session webinar you get access to past recordings immediately after registration. Usually it makes sense to watch them before the live session.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">ipSpace.net subscription</a> gives you access to all ipSpace.net webinars (currently almost 170 hours of content) and unlimited live sessions.</li>
</ul>
