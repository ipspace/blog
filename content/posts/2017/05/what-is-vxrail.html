title: What is VxRail?

<p>One of my readers was considering Dell/EMC hyperconverged solutions and sent me this question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Just wondering if you have a chance to check out VxRail.</blockquote>
<p>I read the data sheet and spec sheet, but have never seen anyone using it (any real-life experience highly welcome – please write a comment).<!--more--></p>
<p>He continued with “<em>Any chance on doing a webinar on the topic?</em>”</p>
<p>Not really. VxRail is just a hardware/SKU packaging exercise. From the software perspective it's mostly a vSphere HA cluster using VSAN for distributed storage, probably having additional easy-to-use provisioning/managing software, similar to what VMware was doing with <a href="/2014/08/vmware-evorail-one-stop-shopping-for/">EVO:Rail</a>.</p>
<p>I covered the networking aspects of vSphere HA clusters in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/VSphere_6_Networking_Deep_Dive"><em>vSphere 6 Networking Deep Dive</em></a> webinar, distributed storage in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Designing_Private_Cloud_Infrastructure"><em>Designing Private Cloud Infrastructure</em></a> webinar, and mentioned some long-distance aspects in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Designing_Active-Active_and_Disaster_Recovery_Data_Centers"><em>Designing Active-Active and Disaster Recovery Data Centers</em></a> webinar, so I don't think there's much more to say about it. </p>
<p>Eventually I will do an <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_3.0_Updates">update</a> of the storage section of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_3.0_for_Networking_Engineers">DC 3.0 webinar</a> (it's been <a href="https://trello.com/b/9LhRHSsv/ipspace-net-webinar-development">planned for a long while</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> you get all of the above-mentioned webinars with the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">ipSpace.net subscription</a>, and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual">professional</a> or <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Teams">team subscriptions</a> include an online consulting session.</p>
