title: Let's build a small network automation solution!

<p>Do you have the feeling that you should know more about network automation, but don't know where to start? I was facing that same problem in 2015, and then started exploring Ansible (plus YAML, Jinja2, Git, Puppet…), creating small playbooks, and finally came to a point where I said "<em>now I know that you can have a small solution solving an actual problem ready in a few weeks even if you know absolutely nothing today</em>".<!--more--></p>
<p>Based on that belief I created the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> course targeting network engineers that know nothing about network automation. The goal: assuming you haven’t touched network automation before, get you to the point where you’re ready to deploy an actual solution in approximately 2 months.</p>
<p>The January 2017 session was a huge success: I couldn’t believe how many follow-up emails I got from the attendees that managed to do exactly what I envisioned: roll out something small but useful in a production environment.</p>
<p>Do you want to be like them? <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Check out the details</a> and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions#register">register for the next online course</a> (the enthusiast price expires on May 31st).</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to working with you on cool network automation stuff ;)</p>
