<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>With <a href="http://www.officeholidays.com/countries/europe/epiphany.php">January 6<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span></a> the Christmas/New Year holidays are over even for most European countries, so it’s time to restart my blog and set some goals for 2017.</p>
<h4>Webinars</h4><p>2015 was year of SDN, 2016 was year of network automation, and 2017 is shaping up to be the year of the cloud.<!--more--></p>
<p>I will definitely do an <strong>AWS Networking</strong> webinar and might do an <strong>OpenStack networking</strong> one (still not sure how to handle the thousand Neutron implementations out there). There will be a refresh of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Cloud_Computing_Networking"><strong>Cloud Computing Networking</strong></a> webinar and an add-on section to <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/VXLAN_Technical_Deep_Dive"><strong>VXLAN</strong></a> webinar describing EVPN in more details.</p>
<p>Speaking of <strong>EVPN</strong>: I have the speakers lined up for a multi-vendor EVPN saga. I’ll start with an overview of the technology, and will have guest speakers talking about Juniper, Cisco and Cumulus implementations of EVPN. I doubt I’ll be able to get someone from Arista (or even want to try) – the last time the speaker got a gag order a week before the webinar, and I’m reluctant to go through the same experience again.</p>
<p>Two other webinars in dire need of a refresh are the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/DMVPN:_From_Basics_to_Scalable_Networks">DMVPN</a> and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Interconnects">DCI</a> webinars. Hopefully I’ll find time to do that as well.</p>
<p>In other news, we’ll continue with <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Network_Automation_Use_Cases"><strong>network automation use cases</strong></a>, finish <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Architectures"><strong>leaf-and-spine fabric designs</strong></a>, have a hands-on ACI talk, and do a webinars on <strong>right-sizing the networks</strong> and <strong>open networking</strong>.</p>
<p class="more">You do know you can <a href="https://trello.com/b/9LhRHSsv/ipspace-net-webinar-development">always see my pipeline in a Trello board</a>, right?</p>
<h4>Online courses</h4><p>Online courses have been a huge success. The <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">network automation one</a> is starting in a few days, and the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">data center one on March 30<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span></a>. There will be another network automation course in autumn, but I probably won’t have time to repeat the data center one this year – the March/April session is your only chance ;)</p>
<p>I will definitely figure out a way to give people interested in online courses an early access to the materials and some live support with an option to move to the interactive course when it’s announced. Details coming in summer timeframe.</p>
<h4>Events and conferences</h4><p>The Troopers organizers invited me to be at their 10<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span> anniversary and I couldn’t possibly decline. I’ll talk about <a href="https://www.troopers.de/events/troopers17/757_securing_network_automation/">securing network automation solutions</a>.</p>
<p>I promised Gabi Gerber a few years ago that I’d help her set up a <a href="http://digs.ch/">Data Center Interest Group</a> in Switzerland and so you’ll see me at 3-4 DIGS events in 2017 (the <a href="http://digs.ch/digs-special-interest-group-sdn/">first one is in early April</a>) and the <a href="http://digs.ch/dc-day/">Data Center/Cloud Day in May 2017</a>. </p>
<p>All events I’m doing in Switzerland are combined with <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Workshops">half-day workshops</a> and we had attendees from all over Europe as well as US and Asia in 2016, so don’t hesitate to drop by. Zurich isn’t the cheapest city in the world, but it’s definitely worth visiting, and attendees usually love the workshops and afternoon events.</p>
<p>I got plenty of questions along the lines of “<em>when is the next ipSpace.net US event going to be</em>” in 2016, so we’ll organize another 2-3 day ipSpace.net workshop in US in late May or early June.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiziano-tofoni-1361759">Tiziano Tofoni</a> asked me to do another seminar in Rome, and it’s simply impossible to refuse his kind invitations – we’ll run a <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Hands-On_Network_Automation">network automation event</a> in mid-October.</p>
