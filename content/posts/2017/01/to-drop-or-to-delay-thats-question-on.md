title: To Drop or To Delay, That’s the Question on Software Gone Wild

A while ago I decided it\'s time to figure out [whether it\'s better to drop or to delay TCP packets](http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/09/policing-or-shaping-it-depends.html), and quickly figured out you get 12 opinions (usually with no real arguments supporting them) if you ask 10 people. Fortunately, I know someone who deals with TCP performance for living, and [Juho Snellman](https://www.snellman.net/blog/) was kind enough to agree to record another podcast.

**Spoiler alert:** many things we \"know\" about TCP are not exactly true. For example, packet drops are not a big deal (but selective acknowledgments and default retransmit timeouts are).

Interestingly, we started discussing the reasons some [people want to reinvent TCP, do it over UDP, and hide what they\'re doing from the network](https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/2016-12-01-quic-tou/), but quickly got back to the fundamental question: to drop or to delay.

The answer is surprising: while you might get better results responding to increased delays (as opposed to packet drops), responding only to drops is a better survival strategy, as latency-sensitive algorithms back off sooner than drop-sensitive ones and thus starve in a congested networks when competing with drop-sensitive algorithms.
