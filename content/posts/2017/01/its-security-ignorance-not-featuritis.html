<p>A <a href="http://ntwrk.guru/back-door-feature-problem/">blog post by Russ White</a> pointed me to an <a href="http://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2016/dont_forget_lock_ndss/dont_forget_lock_ndss.pdf">article describing how IPv6 services tend to be less protected than IPv4 services</a>. No surprise there, people like Eric Vyncke and I were <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_security">telling anyone who was willing to listen</a> that <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/08/ipv6-and-swinging-technology-pendulum.html"><em>operating two-protocol networks isn’t the same thing as operating a single-protocol one</em></a> (see also RFC 1925 rule 4).<!--more--></p>
<p class="info">I always had <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/10/you-must-take-control-of-ipv6-in-your.html">great fun explaining the potential security implications</a>, and actually had someone walking out of a presentation with a deeply concerned look on his face once.</p>
<p>However, I disagree with Russ’ conclusions that the problem observed in that article is caused by too many features in the network operating systems. While most networking devices do have a severe case of featuritis, the root cause of the lack of IPv6 security is way simpler: ignorance (invoking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor">Hanlon’s razor</a>) of product managers and programmers working for major networking companies.</p>
<p>Just to give you a simple example: assume you control access to your Cisco IOS routers with VTY ACLs. If you enable IPv6 on those devices anyone can access them… until you configure <strong>ipv6 access-class </strong>to protect them on IPv6 side. Way worse, the last time I checked you still <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/05/http-over-ipv6-on-cisco-ios.html">couldn’t restrict IPv6 access to the web server running on Cisco IOS</a>. No comment, let captain Picard <a href="https://i.imgflip.com/jaq5c.jpg">have the last word</a>.</p>
<p>Linux is no better. There’s <strong>iptables </strong>and <strong>ip6tables</strong>. If your servers <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/10/you-must-take-control-of-ipv6-in-your.html">magically acquire IPv6 addresses you might be toast</a>. One of the few systems that works correctly and tries to offer the same default security on IPv4 and IPv6 is Windows.</p>
<p class="note">Microsoft having the most secure operating system? Are we in an alternate reality?</p>
<p>Would it be so hard to make things secure? Not really, in many cases it would be good enough to change the defaults from <strong>permit access from anywhere </strong>to <strong>deny access unless told otherwise </strong>or <strong>permit access from inside network</strong> (which wouldn’t solve the problem but would still be much better than what we have today). Is anyone reminded of Windows <em>home/work/public </em>networks?</p>
<p>Finally, how can we blame application developers for their total security ignorance, if even the programming teams working for networking vendors can’t get it right?</p>
