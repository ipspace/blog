<p>A while ago I decided it's time to figure out <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/09/policing-or-shaping-it-depends.html">whether it's better to drop or to delay TCP packets</a>, and quickly figured out you get 12 opinions (usually with no real arguments supporting them) if you ask 10 people. Fortunately, I know someone who deals with TCP performance for living, and <a href="https://www.snellman.net/blog/">Juho Snellman</a> was kind enough to agree to record another podcast.</p>
<p class="update">Update 2017-03-31: Added <em>More information</em> section<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Spoiler alert:</strong> many things we "know" about TCP are not exactly true. For example, packet drops are not a big deal (but selective acknowledgments and default retransmit timeouts are).</p>
<p>Interestingly, we started discussing the reasons some <a href="https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/2016-12-01-quic-tou/">people want to reinvent TCP, do it over UDP, and hide what they're doing from the network</a>, but quickly got back to the fundamental question: to drop or to delay.</p>
<p>The answer is surprising: while you might get better results responding to increased delays (as opposed to packet drops), responding only to drops is a better survival strategy, as latency-sensitive algorithms back off sooner than drop-sensitive ones and thus starve in a congested networks when competing with drop-sensitive algorithms. </p>
