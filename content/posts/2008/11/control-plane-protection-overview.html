A determined attacker can quickly overload the CPU of any router (or switch) with a targeted denial-of-service attack, either by sending IP packets that are propagated from the switching fabric (or interrupt code on software-only platforms) to the control plane processes or by targeting individual services running on the router (see, for example, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2006/09/use-your-cisco-router-as-primary-dns.html?showComment=1179418200000#c4838782550133687473">the problems one of the readers had with public DNS server running on the router</a>).</p>
<p>Cisco IOS offers several control plane protection mechanisms. I’ve summarized them in the “<a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Protecting_the_router%E2%80%99s_control_plane">Protecting the router’s control plane</a>” article in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">3</span> wiki</a> and <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/User:Smajewski">Sebastian Majewski</a> has provided <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Router_security_template">sample router configuration.</a></p>
