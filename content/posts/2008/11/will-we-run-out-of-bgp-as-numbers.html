All these end-customers obviously need their own AS number and it’s no wonder the experts predict we’ll run out of AS numbers in two to three years.</p>
<p>There’s no need to panic: the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4893.txt">technical solution (four byte AS numbers)</a> has been <a href="http://wiki.icons.apnic.net/display/ASN/Home">ready for several years</a> … but it’s not implemented yet in majority of Cisco IOS-based platforms. Does that mean we’ll experience Internet-wide problems when the <a href="http://www.ripe.net/ripe/policies/proposals/2005-12.html">regional registries start allocating AS numbers larger than 65536</a> in a few months? Luckily, the answer is NO, <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid103_gci1335974,00.html">the new BGP standards are completely backward-compatible</a> … but if you’re a Service Provider, you have to start thinking about the upgrade path.</p>
