<div class="bloggerBody"><p>One of my kids managed to get infected with a particularly sneaky Facebook Trojan: a link from a friend (probably also infected) pointed to a web page with a video that required installation of a newer version of the Flash player … which was actually the first part of the Trojan. It quickly downloaded a few more components and made itself cozy deep within Windows XP.</p>
<p class="note">Before you start telling me that kids would click anything … we had “a few” not so very pleasant discussion after previous infections and they know not to open anything or click on something that looks strange. Unfortunately the update-happy industry has conditioned them to constant prompts to upgrade one or another component and the request to upgrade the Flash player was obviously too legitimate-looking.</p>
<!--more--><p>Of course the workstations have anti-virus software which served me very well in the past. It identified the malware and claimed it had been quarantined. WRONG. Repeated scans with the same software always found the malware and claimed it has been cleaned. WRONG. On-line scanner from the same vendor identified a different malware and “removed” it. WRONG.</p>
<p>The worst part of the experience was a total lack of in-depth information that I became used to in the past (for example, the names of the infected files) as well as the claim that this is a “low threat” malware (which is why I was not alerted when the infection happened … if the anti-virus software tells you you’ve got low-threat infection and it has been cleaned, you don’t start panicking).</p>
<p>The only anti-virus package that really helped me was coming from an unbelievable source: Microsoft. Its monthly anti-malware program correctly identified four different Trojan components and pointed me to Microsoft’s anti-virus online solution, which contained all the information I needed, including the list of infected files that it could not remove. A safe-mode reboot, manual cleanup and a few more scans solved the problem.</p>
<p>After this experience, I’m left wondering. In the past, people claimed you should use anti-virus software from an independent source, and now it looks those sources are worse than Microsoft. Should I really give up and go for a one-vendor solution? Or should I reformat all the workstations in house and move to Fedora :). What are your experiences?</p>
