BFD is one of those simple ingenious ideas that make you wonder "*Why did it take them so long to figure this out?*" It's a UDP-based protocol that replaces dozens of link-level failure-detection mechanisms and routing protocol tweaks with a simple, focused solution: detect hop-by-hop layer-3 failures.

In November 2008 IP corner article I described BFD principles, its configuration on Cisco IOS and give you practical examples how you can use BFD to improve next-hop failure detection. You'll find the link to the article [somewhere in this list](/kb/Internet/).

For more details on how BFD interacts with the routing protocols watch the *[How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work)* webinar.
