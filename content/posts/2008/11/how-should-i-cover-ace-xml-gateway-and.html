title: How should I cover ACE XML Gateway and Web Application Firewall?

<p>I was delighted when I got access to Cisco's ACE XML Gateway/Web Application Firewall (WAF) box. This box is the perfect intersection of three fields I'm really interested in: networking, security and web programming, so I'll work with it quite a lot in the future and post interesting tips and tricks about its usage.</p>
<p>As this blog is currently focused exclusive on Cisco IOS, I'm wondering how to cover these new products. I won't create another blog; it simply doesn't make sense to build another blog from the ground up, but there are a few other options. Please help me select the best one by voting in the poll.</p>
