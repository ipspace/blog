<div class="bloggerBody"><p>As always, Jeremy Stretch posted several interesting articles: <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2008/oct/27/hijacking-hsrp/">how to hijack HSRP</a>, <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2008/nov/03/disabling-split-horizon/">introduction to split horizon in distance vector routing protocols</a> and (long needed) <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2008/nov/07/redistribution-seed-metrics/">default redistribution metrics</a>.</p>
<p>Petr Lapukhov started playing with HTTP URL regular expressions within NBAR and <a href="http://blog.internetworkexpert.com/2008/11/04/using-nbar-for-http-url-filtering/">documented his findings</a>. The most interesting is the last Q/A pair: can I use NBAR as a content filtering engine?</p>
<p>And last but definitely not least, if youâ€™re worried what will happen to WPA2 now that <a href="http://6200networks.com/2008/11/06/wpa-wi-fi-encryption-is-cracked/">WPA has been cracked</a>, <a href="http://erratasec.blogspot.com/2008/11/wpa2-is-not-next-on-chopping-block.html">Robert Graham explains the fundamental differences between WPA and WPA2</a>. Also, make sure you read <a href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/wpa-cracked.ars">the detailed explanation of the WPA flaw</a> to understand its implications.</p>
