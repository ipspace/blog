<div class="bloggerBody"><p>In mid-December, I’ll do my first <em>IOS Hints Online Session</em>. These sessions will be short (30-60 minutes), very interactive (I hope, but that’s your choice) and focused on an interesting design/deployment aspect. The description of the design/deployment challenge addressed by the session will be available well in advance at the time when you’ll be able to register. </p>
<p>Each session will start with a few diagrams explaining the proposed solution to the session’s topic and continue with hands-on explanation on actual devices. Each session will be limited to ~15 participants who will be able to actively participate, ask questions, propose alternative solutions or even discuss their actual issues (assuming they are somewhat related to the primary topic of the session).</p>
<p>I have a “few” ideas what could be covered in these sessions, but having a real-life challenge coming from the readers of my blog would be much better. If you have a good idea that could fit into this concept, please <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Contact">send me a short description</a> before Friday, November 21<sup>st</sup>. I’ll collect the best ones, publish short descriptions in a blog post and you’ll prioritize which ones you’d like to see first.</p>
