<div class="bloggerBody"><p>The November Technical Services News from Cisco included the <a href="http://supportwiki.cisco.com/ViewWiki/index.php/Tech_Insights:Annotating_Troubleshooting_Sessions">Annotating Troubleshooting Sessions</a> document from the Cisco’s support wiki. The document describes two well hidden features of Cisco IOS:</p>
<ul class="Bullet1"><li>The <strong>send log </strong>exec-level command writes a line in the <em>syslog</em>, allowing you to delineate logging or debugging outputs.</li>
<li>The exclamation mark used as the first character in any IOS command line (not just in the configuration) serves as a comment. If you’re logging the TTY session, you can use these comments to document the session.</li>
</ul>
