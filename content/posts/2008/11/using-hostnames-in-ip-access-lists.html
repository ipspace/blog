<div class="bloggerBody"><p>When I was <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/11/acl-object-groups.html">configuring the access list</a> that should <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/11/becoming-spammer-hands-on-experience.html">prevent spammers from misusing my workstations</a>, I obviously had to figure out the IP address of the ISP’s SMTP server (access lists and object groups accept IP addresses). I almost started <strong>nslookup </strong>on my Linux workstation, but then decided to try entering a hostname in an IOS ACL … and it works. Unfortunately, IOS performs a DNS lookup when you enter the hostname (assuming you have configured the <strong>ip name-server</strong>) and stores the resulting IP address in the ACL definition:</p>
<pre class="code">rtr(config)#<strong>ip access-list extended InsideList</strong><br/>rtr(config-ext-nacl)#<strong>permit tcp any host smtp.example.com eq smtp</strong><br/>Translating "smtp.example.com"...domain server (192.168.0.1) [OK]<br/>rtr(config-ext-nacl)#<strong>do show access-list InsideList</strong><br/>Extended IP access list InsideList<br/>    10 permit tcp any <span class="high">host 192.168.2.3</span> eq smtp</pre><p>You can enter hostnames in ACLs or network object groups. In both cases, the name is immediately translated into an IP address.</p>
