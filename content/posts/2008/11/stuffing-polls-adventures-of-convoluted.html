<p>You might remember that the last polls I did using Blogger all resulted in every option having exactly the same number of votes. At that time, I've blamed Google ... and I have to apologize. It was obviously someone who has nothing better to do in his life. The log files I've collected indicate he's coming from Poland and I would appreciate if my Polish readers could help me persuade this troubled individual that he should spend his time doing something else (details in the rest of the post).</p>
<!--more--><p>I've decided to use another polling service for the current set of polls, just to make sure it was not a Blogger problem. Polls went smoothly and displayed an expected spread of votes, but yesterday morning I've noticed that the number of votes for each option were getting more and more equal. Fortunately, the new polling service allows me to track votes by IP address, so I was quickly able to discover that someone using the IP address 88.220.105.18 was stuffing the ballot box. I've cleared the votes and hoped he'd realize he's been discovered and stop.</p>
<p>Well, this individual realized he's been discovered ... and moved over to a proxy server belonging to a system integrator (88.250.50.210; wawproxy.solidex.com.pl) and a private DSL connection (83.24.94.111; dnm111.neoplus.adsl.tpnet.pl). By this morning he submitted over 600 votes and now he moved back to 88.220.105.18 (that could be where he works, as the IP address is just one hop away from the POS interface of a Telenergo router).</p>
<p>As said above, anything you can do to help me would be much appreciated (I would prefer this over writing complaining e-mails to the <i>postmaster</i> and <i>abuse</i> aliases of the affected networks). Thanks!</p>
