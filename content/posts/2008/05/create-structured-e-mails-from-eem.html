A few weeks ago I've <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/04/cookbook-collect-router-printouts-in.html">described how to use the <strong>append</strong> show filter and <strong>more</strong> command to send e-mails containing multiple printouts from an EEM applet</a>. A few hours after I've published the post, David Houser sent me a great EEM applet that used texts stored in <em>flash:</em> files to generate headings between various show commands. While his solution works perfectly (and gives you all the flexibility you want), it's a bit verbose and requires lots of small files that clutter your <em>flash:</em> memory. I've thus decided to write a <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Include_structured_command_printout_in_EEM_output">small Tcl script that executes the Cisco IOS command specified in the command line and appends the command results together with a heading in an output file</a>.
