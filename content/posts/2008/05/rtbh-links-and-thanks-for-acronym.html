<a href="/2008/05/how-do-you-know-youre-sp-geek/#comments">One of the comments to my Sunday post</a> mentioned RTBH. Obviously I'm not geeky enough, as I <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=RTBH">had to ask uncle Google for help</a> (but don't worry, I'll work on my geekiness factor :). <br/><br/>The search results produced a few very interesting links, among them a <a href="http://www.arbornetworks.com/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=112">well-structured presentation on RTBH</a> that refers to a paper describing how you can <a href="http://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2001/BackScatter/usenixsecurity01.pdf">detect remote DoS attacks with the backscatter analysis</a> (assuming the attackers are randomly spoofing source IP addresses).
