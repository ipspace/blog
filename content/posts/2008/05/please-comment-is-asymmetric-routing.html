<p>We've always been trying to minimize asymmetric routing, in both design and implementation phase, as it impacts a number of IP services/features, including:</p>
<ul><li>Network Address Translation;</li>
<li>Content-based Access Control (CBAC);</li>
<li>Reflexive access lists;<br/></li>
<li>Redundant firewalls (at least until recently);</li>
<li>IP Multicast;</li>
</ul>
<p>In some scenarios, asymmetric routing can impact delay/jitter and consequently the perceived quality of service.</p>
<p>However, asymmetric routing is a reality within the Internet (it's close to impossible to guarantee symmetric routing even for multi-homed end users) and it might even help in some scenarios (low-speed/low-delay upstream link with high-speed/high-delay downstream link).</p>
<p>What's your opinion? Is asymmetric routing harmful? Should we strive to avoid it ... or do you just accept it as one of facts of life?</p>
