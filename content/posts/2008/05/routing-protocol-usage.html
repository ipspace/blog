The <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2008/05/which-routing-protocol-do-you-use.html">results of the routing protocol poll</a> are in. As expected, OSPF is more popular than EIGRP (60:40 ratio), with IS-IS having significant presence (primarily large SP networks, I would assume) and some people using RIP in the edges of the network.<br/><br/>What really surprised me was the very large percentage of users using BGP. Either BGP is becoming very popular in the enterprise networks or most of the readers are coming from Service Provider environments.<a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_K_pkZO5-tTg/SDkhz5uu4WI/AAAAAAAACbo/kOUe2cJAjvc/s1600-h/Routing+Protocol+votes.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5204228019957195106" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_K_pkZO5-tTg/SDkhz5uu4WI/AAAAAAAACbo/kOUe2cJAjvc/s320/Routing+Protocol+votes.jpg" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 10px auto; CURSOR: pointer; TEXT-ALIGN: center"/></a>And last but not least, it looks like I'm focusing on the topics (BGP and OSPF) that you actually use in your networks (or maybe it's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy">self-fulfilling prophecy</a> and you read my blog because I write about topics that you're interested in :).
