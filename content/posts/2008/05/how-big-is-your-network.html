Based on the somewhat <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2008/05/routing-protocol-usage.html">surprising results of the <em>routing protocols</em> poll</a> (the high percentage BGP got), it would be nice to know the network type that you design/manage/operate. Please respond to this week's readers' poll; if you work for Cisco, other equipment vendors or a system integrator/professional services company, simply select the network type that you work with most often.
