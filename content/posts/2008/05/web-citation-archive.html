The blogging world is an interestingly dynamic place ... sometimes a <a href="/2008/04/bgp-essentials-non-transit-as/#c8876650702835896743">page would vanish moments after you would mention it in a blog post</a> :) Google Cache might be a short term solution, but you could use a much better tool: <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/">Webcite</a> gives you the ability to store a snapshot of a web page at the time you've cited it.
