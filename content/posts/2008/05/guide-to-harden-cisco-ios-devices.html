In the last days, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cisco+ios+rootkit">industry journalists have started to make a big fuzz about a Cisco IOS rootkit</a> that someone is going to present in a few days. Personally I doubt it would go beyond <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/03/tcl-based-ios-backdoor.html">Tcl scripts that we already know about</a> (OK, maybe it's EEM-based so it doesn't need a VTY and maybe it starts at router reload) â€¦ but I might be really surprised.<br/><br/>However, the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sr-20080516-rootkits.shtml">Cisco's response to this announcement</a> (which was basically saying "we haven't seen anything new yet") included a nice gem: a link to the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_tech_note09186a0080120f48.shtml">Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS Devices document</a>.
