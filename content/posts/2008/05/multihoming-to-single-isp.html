The <strong>neighbor remove-private-as</strong> option is used in scenarios where you run BGP between public and private AS numbers to collect IP prefixes and advertise these prefixes to the rest of the world as belonging to the public AS. The most common design in this category is <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Multihoming_to_one_ISP">multihoming to a single ISP</a>.<p class='more'>This article is part of <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/01/youve-asked-for-it-series.html">You've asked for it</a> <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/search/label/You%27ve%20asked%20for%20it">series</a>.</p>
