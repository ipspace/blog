Another interesting question I've received:<blockquote class="cite">Can you please recommend me literature explaining the architecture of Cisco routers and switches (buffers, control-plane, forwarding-plane, process switching â€¦)</blockquote>
The best one I've found so far is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1578701813?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ajaxandxml-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1578701813">Inside Cisco IOS Software Architecture</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ajaxandxml-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1578701813" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" width="1"/>, but it's a bit old, so if you've found something better, please comment.<p style="font-size: 70%">Full disclosure: if you click on the link above and buy the book, I might eventually get $1.76 from Amazon.</p>
