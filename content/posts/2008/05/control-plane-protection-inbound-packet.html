The <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/05/ospf-bypasses-control-plane-protection.html">inability of Control Plane host interface to detect inbound OSPF packets</a> (and the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/05/ospf-bypasses-control-plane-protection.html#comments">flurry of comments that followed my blog post</a>) has prompted Sebastian and myself to search for more documentation and conduct further tests. Sebastian already had a working configuration from which he could infer most of the configuration rules and he also found the well-written <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/understanding-cppr.html">Understanding CPPr</a> document on CCO. Together with the tests I ran in my router lab, we're pretty confident the CPPr inbound packet classification rules are (approximately) as follows:<br/><p class="warn">Use the latest 12.4T software (at least 12.4(15)T5) if you want reliable CPPr operation.</p>
<ul><li><strong>control-plane </strong>aggregate <strong>service-policy</strong> disables any control-plane subinterface service policies. </li>
<li>If you want to use the per-subinterface (<strong>host</strong>, <strong>transit</strong> and <strong>cef-exception</strong>) policies, you have to remove the inbound service policy from the <strong>control-plane </strong>aggregate path.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/01/cef-punted-packets.html">Routed packets that cannot be CEF-switched</a> (have to be punted to another switching mechanism) are classified as <em>transit</em><strong> </strong>packets.</li>
<li>Local multicast packets with destination IP addresses within IP prefix 224.0.0.0/24 and packets with TTL &lt;= 1 are classified as <em>transit</em><strong> </strong>packets in 12.4(15)T5. These packets will be classified as <em>cef-exception</em><strong> </strong>packets in the future (see the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/understanding-cppr.html">Understanding CPPr</a> document).</li>
<li>Unicast packets without IP options addressed to the router and having TTL &gt; 1 are classified as <em>host</em><strong> </strong>packets.</li>
<li>Non-IP traffic (ARP, Frame Relay keepalives, CDP ...) is classified as <em>cef-exception</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">The TTL-related rules explain why the router classifies IBGP packets as <em>host</em> packets and EBGP packets as <em>transit</em> packets. As soon as you configure <strong>neighbor ebgp-multihop</strong> on the router router, inbound EBGP packets become <em>host</em> packets.</p>
