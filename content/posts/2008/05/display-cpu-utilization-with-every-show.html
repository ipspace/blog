Xavier has <a href="/2008/05/continuous-display-of-top-cpu-processes/#c1472479916320962851">mentioned an interesting undocumented command</a> in his comment to the “<a href="/2008/05/continuous-display-of-top-cpu-processes/">Continuous display of top CPU processes</a>” post: after you execute <strong>terminal exec prompt timestamp</strong>, every show command displays current time and CPU utilization before the requested printout.<!--more-->Here is a short example:<pre class="code">R1#<strong>terminal exec prompt timestamp </strong><br/>R1#<strong>show ip interface brief</strong><br/><span class="high">Load for five secs: 4%/0%; one minute: 1%; five minutes: 0%<br/>Time source is NTP, 17:31:14.456 UTC Wed May 28 2008</span><br/><br/>Interface                  IP-Address      OK?
