**Keep in mind**: Use private IP addresses, AS numbers and domain names in all technical documentation you\'re producing (unless, of course, you\'re describing an actual network). If you\'re forced to use public addresses or AS numbers (for example, to illustrate how the neighbor remote-private-as command works), you should clearly state that they are imaginary.

You can safely use:

* [IPv4 prefixes reserved for private use by RFC 1918](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918)
* [Documentation IPv4 prefixes reserved in RFC 5737](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5737)\
(192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24 and 203.0.113.0/24)

**IPv6**
* IPv6 prefix 2001:DB8::/32 [reserved for documentation in RFC 3849](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3849)

**2-byte ASN**
