When you have to monitor which processes consume router's CPU over a period of time, a <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Continuous_display_of_top_CPU_processes">Tcl script that emulates the Unix <strong>top</strong> command</a> might come handy. <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Continuous_display_of_top_CPU_processes#Source_code">Download it</a>, <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Continuous_display_of_top_CPU_processes#Installation">install it</a> and enjoy the view :)<p class="note">If anyone has discovered a reliable technique that detects a keypress event (= character available on <em>stdin</em>) in the Tcl loop, please let me know. The Ctrl/C solution is a kludge.</p>
