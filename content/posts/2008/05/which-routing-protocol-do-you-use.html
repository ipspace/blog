Years ago EIGRP and OSPF had strong presence in large enterprise networks, BGP was used solely by Internet Service providers and IS-IS was a rarity (and there were people using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banyan_VINES">Banyan Vines</a>). <br/><br/>The situation has probably changed over the last years, I would (sadly) expect EIGRP to decline and (happily) BGP to grow. Let's figure it out; please respond to this week's readers' poll. Of course you can choose more than one routing protocol.
