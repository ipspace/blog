<ol><li>You're creating a multi-AS BGP test lab on Sunday evening;</li>
<li>The core AS is running 12.2SRC code;<br/></li>
<li>You insert a P-router in the core network ... because every large network has P-routers;</li>
<li>You create BGP session templates instead of configuring two parameters of a few IBGP neighbors;</li>
<li>You configure MPLS in the core network instead of using BGP on all routers ... because it saves you a few BGP sessions ... and that's the way things should be done anyway;</li>
<li>When configuring OSPF, you define inter-AS links as passive interfaces ... not because you're running OSPF in the other AS but for security reasons :)<br/></li>
<li>... add your comment here ...<br/></li>
</ol>
