Terry Slattery took time (after 15 years) and <a href="https://www.netcraftsmen.com/the-history-of-the-cisco-cli/">wrote a short history of Cisco CLI</a>. I've been involved with Cisco's software (it was remarketed as IOS in mid-nineties) for a few years and for me the CLI as we know it today was one of the best features introduced in IOS release 9.21 (I was ecstatic when I've got my hands on the first code during the beta tests). So now that I know who's responsible, I can only say “Thanks, Terry!”
