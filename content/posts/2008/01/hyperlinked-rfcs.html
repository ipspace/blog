If you're too young to remember the days of IBM mainframes, punched cards and 132-column printouts, you could get a feeling for what we had to cope with by looking at the original RFC texts. Even the latest RFCs are published in text-only fixed-font format with no extra formatting, making it a nightmare to quote a section of the RFC in a post or an article (not to mention the very real danger of falling asleep just by looking at an RFC).<br/><br/>A variety of third-party web sites have tried to fill the gap by providing RFCs in hyperlinked or PDF format. I've tried a few of them and usually got turned away by inconsistent or broken links.<br/><br/>Finally, IETF recognized that we live in the third millenium and started offering IETF documents (including RFCs) with HTML markup. To get hyperlinked versions of the RFCs, go to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/">IETF tools web site</a> and enter RFC number or use Google to search the IETF repository.
