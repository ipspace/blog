<p>In a response to my post <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/07/redundant-dhcp-server.html">Redundant DHCP Server</a> I've speculated that a Cisco router should coexist with a Windows-based DHCP server if you configure them with non-overlapping address ranges. I was wrong, Edgar Cahuana discovered that Microsoft's DHCP server wants to have complete control over the LAN it's serving and shuts down if it detects another DHCP server on the same LAN.</p>
<p>To make the two DHCP servers coexist, you have to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299363">disable rogue DHCP server</a> detection in Windows DHCP server, <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/obts/archive/2005/09/05/65484.aspx">as explained in this article</a>.</p>
<p class="note">The difference between rogue server detection in Windows 2000/2003 and SBS 2003 is explained in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/community/chats/trans/network/net1120.mspx">this TechNet chat</a>.</p>
