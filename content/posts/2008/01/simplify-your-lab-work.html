<p>If you do a lot of tests in a router lab, you're probably getting upset when you have to retype the login and enable password whenever you log into a router. What I do in my labs is to disable VTY login, set the default privilege level to 15 and disable exec timeout (to stop the router from terminating my session).</p>
<pre class="code">line con 0<br/> exec-timeout 0 0<br/> privilege level 15<br/>line vty 0 4<br/> exec-timeout 0 0<br/> privilege level 15<br/> no login</pre><p class="note">Obviously, this would not bring you additional points on the CCIE lab exam :)</p>
