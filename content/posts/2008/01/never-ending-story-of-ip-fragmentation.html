<p>In the last few months I've run across a number of IP fragmentation issues, as you've probably <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/search?q=MTU&updated-max=2007-12-31T00:00:00">noticed through my blog posts</a>. I've also encountered a lot of misconceptions about IP fragmentation, its impact on GRE and IPSec as well as the fragmentation-related mechanisms, for example MTU Path Discovery. I hope that you'll find my January <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner">IP Corner</a> article <a href="http://learning.nil.com/tips-and-tricks/technical-articles/show/the-never-ending-story-of-ip-fragmentation/">The Never-Ending Story of IP Fragmentation</a> a good summary of the subject.</p>
