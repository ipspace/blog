The chances that you would be able to start SSH or Telnet session from an EEM applet were pretty slim, but <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/12/eem-cli-patterns-are-not-context.html#comments">the comment from melwong</a> triggered my curiosity and I simply had to try it. After all, as the <strong>action cli</strong> command uses a VTY line (like a regular user session), you might be able to use the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/12/execute-cli-commands-with-prompts-in.html"><strong>pattern</strong> option of the <strong>action cli</strong> command</a> to write something similar to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expect"><em>expect</em></a> script. This was my best shot at getting it done:<pre class="code">event manager applet SSH<br/> event none<br/> action 0.9 cli command "enable"<br/> action 1.0 cli command "ssh -l <em>ssUser</em> R2" pattern "word:"<br/> action 1.1 cli command "<em>ssPassword</em>" pattern "#"<br/> action 2.0 cli command "clear ip route *" pattern "#"<br/> action 3.0 cli command "exit" pattern "#"</pre><p>My applet got past the SSH authentication (debugging on R2 confirmed that the SSH session was started) but could not send data through the session itself (it hung on the <strong>clear ip route</strong> command).</p>
