Configuring a large number of similar BGP peers on a router and ensuring that the changes in your routing policy or BGP design are applied to all of them can be a management nightmare. BGP peer groups were the only scalability tool available on Cisco IOS until the IOS release 12.3T and they had significant limitations as they were also used as a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2006/10/bgp-peer-groups-no-longer-performance.html">performance improvement tool</a>.<br/><br/>IOS releases 12.0S and 12.3T introduced peer templates, a scalable hierarchical way of configuring BGP session parameters and inbound/outbound policies. For example, to configure the session parameters for all your IBGP sessions, use the following session template:<pre class="code">router bgp 65001<br/> template peer-session IBGP<br/>  remote-as 65001<br/>  description IBGP peers<br/>  password s3cr3t<br/>  update-source Loopback0</pre><p>After the session template has been configured, adding a new IBGP peer takes just a single configuration command (two if you want to add neighbor description):</p>
<pre class="code">router bgp 65001<br/> neighbor 10.0.1.2 inherit peer-session IBGP<br/> neighbor 10.0.1.2 description R2</pre><p class="note">If you're looking for more in-depth BGP knowledge, try our <a href="http://www.nil.si/ls/BS_BGP32?showlp">Configuring BGP on Cisco Routers</a> <a href="http://www.nil.si/C1256F0A00429755/html/bs_portfolio">e-learning solution</a>.
