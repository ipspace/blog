If you like to use Google as your primary search engine, this trick could help you get better search results when you're looking up IOS configuration commands:<ul><li>Use the <em>site:cisco.com</em> in your query to make sure you're not getting hits from mirror sites or people writing about Cisco IOS (like myself)</li>
<li>Use <em>inurl:ios124</em> query term (or whichever IOS release you're interested in) to get UniverCD results relevant to the desired IOS release</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you want to look up the <strong><a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/12/display-open-tcp-and-udp-ports.html">show control-plane</a></strong> command, use the query <em>"show control-plane" site:cisco.com inurl:ios124</em> to get four highly relevant hits.</p>
