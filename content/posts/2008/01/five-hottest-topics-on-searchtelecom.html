Not surprisingly, MPLS is the top one, with <em>Routers and Switches</em> being the second. It's interesting to see that MPLS is still a very hot topic more than seven years after we've written the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/MPLS-VPN-Architectures-Networking-Technology/dp/1587050021">MPLS and VPN Architectures</a> book … and I'm pretty proud that <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/search/1,293876,sid103,00.html?filter=on&amp;query=Ivan%20Pepelnjak&amp;ctype=ALL&amp;anum=&amp;within=text&amp;psrc=SSM">two of my articles</a> in that category made it to the <em>Editor's picks</em> :).</p>
<p class="more">The <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/References:Ivan_Pepelnjak_on_SearchTelecom">list of all articles I wrote for SearchTelecom</a> is available in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT3 wiki</a>.</p>
