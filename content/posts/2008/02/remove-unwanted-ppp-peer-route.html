When IOS started supporting dynamic allocation of IPCP (IP over PPP) addresses, it also got the mechanism to insert a dynamic host route toward the neighbor's IP address once the IP addresses were negotiated. This mechanism makes perfect sense in dynamic address allocation environments, as the <a href="http://www3.tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1332#section-3.3">subnet mask is not negotiated with IPCP</a>. Without a host route toward the other end of the PPP link, there would be no easy way to reach the IP prefixes reachable via the PPP link.<!--more-->However, the PPP code got way too aggressive in the recent IOS releases. For example, in the 12.4T train, you get a connected host route toward the IP address of the PPP peer even on a leased line where both addresses are in the same IP subnet. Here's a sample printout from my lab router that illustrates this behavior:<pre class="code">R1#<strong>show run interface serial 1/0</strong><br/>Current configuration : 107 bytes<br/>!<br/>interface Serial1/0<br/> ip address <span class="high">10.1.0.1 255.255.255.252</span><br/> encapsulation ppp<br/> serial restart-delay 0<br/>end<br/> <br/>R1#<strong>show ip route 10.1.0.0 255.255.255.252 longer | begin Gateway</strong><br/>Gateway of last resort is not set<br/> <br/>     10.0.0.0/8 is variably subnetted, 4 subnets, 2 masks<br/><span class="high">C       10.1.0.2/32 is directly connected, Serial1/0</span><br/>C       10.1.0.0/30 is directly connected, Serial1/0</pre><p>To disable the automatic insertion of the connected host route, use the <strong>no peer neighbor-route</strong> interface configuration command.</p>
<p class="note">You have to clear the IP routing table or flap the interface to remove the PPP-generated host route</p>
