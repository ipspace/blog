Today's check of <a href="http://www.technorati.com/blogs/ioshints.blogspot.com?reactions">who quotes (and who copies :) my content</a> brought me a "hidden gem": I've discovered a web site that performs automatic translation between any pair of almost 30 languages.<br/><br/>So, if you have nothing better to do and have already checked <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/">your daily Dilbert</a>, here's something that will literally <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/rofl.htm">make you ROFL</a>: use the machine translation of my blog posts (or any other web page that is technical enough to contain words with "unexpected" meanings) into various European languages. You could start <a href="http://www.tranexp.com:2000/topframe.shtml">from the form that appears on top of each translated page</a> (just enter URL and select the target language) or you could <a href="http://www.tranexp.com:2000/InterTran?url=https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/02/bgp-essentials-bgp-communities.html&amp;type=text&amp;text=&amp;from=eng&amp;to=ger">try the BGP communities post translated into German</a> for starters.<br/><br/>But even if you speak no other language than English, don't despair ... this software does wonders in English-to-English translation as well. Check, for example, my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/02/when-ospf-becomes-distance-vector.html"><em>When OSPF Becomes a Distance Vector Protocol</em></a> post <a href="http://www.tranexp.com:2000/InterTran?url=https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/02/when-ospf-becomes-distance-vector.html&amp;type=text&amp;text=&amp;from=eng&amp;to=eng">translated to English</a>.
