<img src="http://www.networkworld.com/includes/styles/i/nwlogo-06.gif" style="float: right; margin-left: 8px;"/>Network World has published an article describing <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/25115">20 useful sites for Cisco networking professionals</a>, featuring among other sites the <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/25115?page=0%2C8">Cisco IOS Hints blog</a>. I felt even better when I've discovered my blog was one of the three non-US sites mentioned in the article :)<br/><br/>It's well worth browsing through the list. I already had most of these sites in my feed reader and I've discovered a few new nuggets.
