I've <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/netmgmt/command/reference/nm_01.html#wp1012749">finally found the EEM reference documentation</a> that specifies the side effects (changes in environment variables) of all <strong>action</strong> commands. You can use the changed environment variables in subsequent <strong>action</strong> commands by prefixing the variable name with the $ sign (similar to the <a href="/2007/11/send-e-mail-when-interface-goes-down.html">EEM applet where I've included router's name in an outgoing e-mail</a>).
