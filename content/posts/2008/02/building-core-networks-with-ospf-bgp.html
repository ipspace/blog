Do you need advanced knowledge and skills needed in designing and implementing core MPLS networks? We have developed exactly the course you need.<br/><br/>The <em><a href="http://www.nil.com/C1256F620032CACB/NILLookup/NIL_BCMPL?Open&amp;dm=C&amp;s=0&amp;rid=C1256F0A00429755">Building Core Networks with BGP, OSPF and MPLS (NIL_BCMPL)</a></em> course focuses on MPLS applications such as MPLS VPN (with special attention to Internet access from a VPN), Any Transport over MPLS (AToM), Carrier Supporting Carrier (CsC) and MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS TE). As a prerequisite for MPLS deployment the routing protocols are explained as well - the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). The scalability issues of the protocols as well as multiprotocol BGP are addressed as well. Several practice labs enable you to gain the necessary experience in deploying the MPLS-based core networks.
