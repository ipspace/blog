<p>If you want study for your CCNP certification by attending live instructor-led courses, you'll have to spend four weeks in a classroom. That's "a bit" too much for some of our customers, so we've been asked to create a shorter version of the courses, resulting in a 2-week very intensive bootcamp structure.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nil.com/ls/NIL_ccnp_boot1">CCNP Bootcamp Part 1</a> combines the content of the first two prerequisite courses for CCNP: Building Scalable Cisco Internetworks (BSCI) and Building Cisco Multilayer Switched Networks (BCMSN). It's an intensive combination of lecture and practice covering routing protocols and LAN switching.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nil.com/ls/NIL_ccnp_boot2">CCNP Bootcamp Part 2</a> combines the content of the second two prerequisite courses for CCNP: Implementing Secure Converged Wide Area Networks (ISCW) and Optimizing Converged Cisco Networks (ONT). This one obviously contains lecture and practice covering secure remote access into core networks using VPN technologies (such as MPLS VPN and IPsec VPN), network security, Quality of Service (QoS) for optimized voice transport as well as wireless security.</p>
