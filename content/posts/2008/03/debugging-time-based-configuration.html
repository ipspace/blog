Debugging time-based configurations could be a nightmare, as you have to switch router's time back and forth trying to debug your configuration and wait for the desired event to occur. When I was debugging my EEM-based solution to time-based BGP policy routing, I simply defined two aliases that would set the clock to 30 seconds before the event I wanted to test:<pre class="code">alias exec 859 clock set 08:59:30<br/>alias exec 900 clock set 09:00:30</pre><p class="note">Obviously, these tests are best done in a lab setup â€¦ and you have to turn off NTP or any other form of time synchronization.</p>
