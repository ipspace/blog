<p>Cisco has recently published a series of documents describing <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/secursw/ps1018/products_configuration_example09186a00809454c7.shtml">how you can connect a SOHO site to two ISPs</a>. According to the timestamps on the documents, it took them a few days more than a year to publish a configuration that's almost identical to the one I've described in the <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner">IP Corner</a> article “<a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/SmallSiteMultiHoming/">Small-site multihoming</a>” … which can only mean that my configuration was close to optimal :)</p>
<p>Their configuration also includes a nice trick: the <strong>ip dhcp client route track <em>number</em> </strong>command is a convenient replacement for a static default route with the <strong>track</strong> option if one of the upstream interfaces uses DHCP and the router generates the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/08/dhcp-based-static-routes.html">default route based on DHCP replies</a>.</p>
