<p>A few days ago I had an “interesting” experience on a router that was running low on memory: when I enabled NAT, it immediately ran out of memory although it had over 4 MB free memory before that (and since I was doing the tests in a lab, I wasn't worried about that … in a production network, 4 MB of free memory is something to worry about).</p>
<p>It took me a while to figure out what was going on: the moment you enable NAT in IOS release 12.4, it activates Network Based Application Recognition (NBAR) even when CEF is disabled (and supposedly NBAR requires CEF to run).</p>
<!--more-->Here's a sample test: the moment I've configured a loopback interface to be NAT inside interface (and it was the only NAT-enabled interface in the box), NBAR consumed 4.5 MB of memory:<pre class="code">R2(config)#<strong>int loop 0</strong><br/>R2(config-if)#<strong>ip nat inside</strong><br/>R2(config-if)#<strong>do show ip nbar resources</strong><br/>NBAR memory usage for tracking Stateful sessions<br/>   System link age      : 30 secs<br/>   Initial memory       : 4455 KBytes<br/>   Max initial memory   : 14852 KBytes<br/>   Memory expansion     : 112 KBytes<br/>   Max memory expansion : 112 KBytes<br/>   Memory in use        : 4455 KBytes<br/>   Max memory allowed   : 29705 KBytes<br/>   Active links         : 0<br/>   Total links          : 39784</pre>
