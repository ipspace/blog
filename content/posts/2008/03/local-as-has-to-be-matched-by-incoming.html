However, without additional options, the <strong>local-as</strong> is inserted in the AS-path of incoming BGP updates <em>before any inbound filters</em>. Your inbound filters thus have to match the <strong>local-as</strong> as well.&lt;!--more--&gt;Consider, for example, the following configuration:<pre class="code">router bgp 65001<br/> neighbor 10.1.0.2 remote-as 10<br/> neighbor 10.1.0.2 local-as 20<br/> neighbor 10.1.0.2 filter-list 1 in<br/>!<br/>ip as-path access-list 1 permit ^10$</pre>Although the configuration looks correct, no routes are accepted from AS 10, as the inbound AS-path always contains locally prepended AS 20 as well as AS 10:<pre class="code">R1#<strong>show ip bgp neighbor 10.1.0.2 received-routes | begin ^$</strong><br/> <br/>   Network     Next Hop      Metric LocPrf Weight Path<br/>*  172.16.0.0  10.1.0.2           0             0 <span class="high">20 10</span> i</pre>To fix this problem, you either have to include local AS in the AS-path access-list or <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2008/01/fix-bgp-as-number-mismatch.html">use the <strong>no-prepend</strong> option of the <strong>neighbor local-as</strong> command</a>.<p class="note">You can get in-depth information on AS-path access-lists in our <a href="http://www.nil.si/ls/BS_BGP32?showlp">Configuring BGP on Cisco Routers</a> <a href="http://www.nil.si/C1256F0A00429755/html/bs_portfolio">e-learning solution</a>.
