It does do a SNMP-5-COLDSTART and SYS-6-BOOTTIME on boot up.</blockquote>
<p>I did an actual power-cycle test of a router (we can do that remotely <a href="http://www.nil.com/C1256F0A00429755/html/remote_labs_portfolio">in our labs</a>, so I didn't have to touch the box :) and the SYS-5-RESTART message is reliably generated at every startup, be it from the power cycle or the reload command (I was not able to provoke an on-demand crash ;).</p>
