Mike Nipp has wondered which <em>syslog</em> message to use to <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/04/fix-router-configuration-after-reload.html">reliably detect router reload</a> under all circumstances:<blockquote class="cite">The problem I had with the SYS-5-RESTART message is I don't think you will get one if the power is suddenly pulled from the router. It does do a SNMP-5-COLDSTART and SYS-6-BOOTTIME on boot up.</blockquote>
<p>I did an actual power-cycle test of a router (we can do that remotely <a href="http://www.nil.com/C1256F0A00429755/html/remote_labs_portfolio">in our labs</a>, so I didn't have to touch the box :) and the SYS-5-RESTART message is reliably generated at every startup, be it from the power cycle or the reload command (I was not able to provoke an on-demand crash ;).</p>
