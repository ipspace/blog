I get asked the same question over and over:<blockquote class="cite">“<em>Is it possible to have unequal-cost load balancing with OSPF?</em>”</blockquote>
<p>The answer is invariably: <strong>NO</strong>, you cannot do it with OSPF. However, you can use MPLS Traffic Engineering to establish two tunnels to the same remote OSPF router. Both tunnels will be used for all destinations reachable through the remote OSPF router (tunnel tail-end) even though OSPF selects only a single best path to it. A simple scenario is described in my <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner">IP Corner</a> article “<a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/LoadSharingTE/"><em>Perfect Load-Balancing: How Close Can You Get?</em></a>”</p>
