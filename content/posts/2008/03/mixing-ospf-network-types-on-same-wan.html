A few days ago, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/02/running-ospf-across-frame-relay.html">I've published a link to a series of OSPF-over-WAN tutorials by Arden Packeer</a>. He went a step further and <a href="http://ardenpackeer.com/routing-protocols/tutorial-ospf-network-types-and-frame-relay-part-4/">analyzed what happens if you mix supposedly incompatible OSPF network types in the same IP subnet</a>.
