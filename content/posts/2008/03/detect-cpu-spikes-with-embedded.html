David Winter wanted to detect high-CPU spikes and act on them. The first part (high CPU utilization) <a href="http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/477/SNMP/collect_cpu_util_snmp.html">could be done with SNMP</a>, but since IOS release 12.3(14)T, the right tool for the job is the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t14/feature/guide/gt_rmimg.html">Embedded Resource Manager (ERM)</a>.<br/><br/>The ERM syntax is a bit baroque (and not well documented), so let's work through the example: this is the configuration you need to detect high overall CPU utilization on the main CPU in the box:<pre class="code">resource policy<br/> policy HighGlobalCPU global<br/>  system<br/>   cpu total<br/>    critical rising 95 falling 70 interval 10<br/>    major rising 75 falling 50 interval 10<br/> !<br/> user global HighGlobalCPU</pre><p>And here are the usage/configuration guidelines:</p>
<ul><li>The whole ERM subsystem is configured under the <b>resource policy</b> section;</li>
<li>You always have to configure a <strong>policy</strong> and a <strong>user</strong> to which the policy applies. In our example, the user is <strong>global</strong> (as we're measuring the global CPU load);</li>
<li>The <strong>policy</strong> we're defining must have the <strong>global</strong> keyword to indicate we're measuring overall utilization (otherwise you can't attach it to the global user);</li>
<li>We're measuring the load on the main CPU, so we're configuring the <strong>system</strong> subsection of the policy (on distributed platforms you could specify <strong>slot <em>name</em></strong> to measure utilization on a specific linecard);</li>
<li>The <strong>cpu</strong> section selects CPU load measurements. You could measure <strong>interrupt</strong> load, <strong>process</strong> load or <strong>total</strong> CPU load.</li>
<li>Within each resource section in the policy (in our example, total CPU load on the main system) you can define <strong>minor</strong>, <strong>major</strong> and <strong>critical</strong> thresholds (syslog messages are generated when each threshold is crossed).</li>
<li>After the policy is defined, it's applied to the <strong>global</strong> user.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the CPU load measurement policy defined, the router will generate syslog messages (SYS-4-CPURESRISING) every time the overall CPU load exceeds the specified rising thresholds. When the utilization falls below the falling threshold, the SYS-4-CPURESFALLING syslog message is generated.</p>
