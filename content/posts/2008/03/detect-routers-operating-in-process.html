Sometimes the CPU utilization on a router would raise unexpectedly due to incoming packets being process switched. A very common scenario is a <a href="/2008/01/never-ending-story-of-ip-fragmentation.html">GRE tail-end router that has to reassemble IP fragments</a> (usually generated due to incorrect MTU size on the GRE head-end or due to IPSec+GRE combination) or a router under Denial-of-Service attack. To detect these conditions, you can define Embedded Resource Manager (ERM) policy that raises an alert when the CPU utilization of the <em>IP Input</em> process exceeds predefined limits.<pre class="code">resource policy<br/>  policy HighProcCPU type iosprocess<br/>   system<br/>    cpu process<br/>     critical rising 40 falling 25<br/>     major rising 20 falling 10<br/>    !<br/>   !<br/>  !<br/><br/>  user group IPInput type iosprocess<br/>   instance "IP Input"<br/>   policy HighProcCPU</pre>And here are some more ERM usage guidelines:<ul><li>This time, we're monitoring a group of processes, so the <strong>policy</strong> definition is no longer <strong>global</strong> but has a <strong>type</strong> (<strong>iosprocess</strong> is the only type defined at the moment).</li>
<li>As in the previous ERM example, we're monitoring CPU utilization of the main CPU (<strong>system</strong>), but this time we're interested in the <strong>process</strong> utilization.</li>
<li>The <strong>policy</strong> is applied to a <strong>user group</strong> of resources of the <strong>type iosprocess </strong> (translated into English: a group of IOS processes).</li>
<li>The only process in this group is the <em>IP Input</em> process (and the "magic keyword" is an <strong>instance</strong> of the group).</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">The quotes in the <strong>instance</strong> configuration command are required, as the command accepts only a single word as the process name.</p>
