Recently I had to create a new domain and the $1.88/year for an .info domain was simply irresistible ... so I also created the <em>ioshints.info</em> domain. The first results are already visible: my blog's URL has been changed to <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/">blog.ioshints.info</a>. All redirections should be done transparently; if that's not the case, please let me know.<br/><br/>Next step: another round of negotiations with the hosting providers to get wiki.ioshints.info where I want it to be :)
