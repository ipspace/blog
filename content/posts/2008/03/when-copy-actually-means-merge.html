<p>Marcus Jensen asked me a very interesting question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite"><em>I want to send 3 lines of configuration to a remote router, but I know the first line will kill my connection. Can I save these 3 lines of code to a text file, and then issue a Tcl command to add those to the running config?</em></blockquote>
<p>The solution is much simpler and does not have to involve Tcl at all. The <strong>copy <em>something</em> system:running-config</strong> command merges the configuration commands in the source file with the current running configuration.</p>
<p class="note">You can <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2008/01/copy-text-files-into-router-flash.html">store the configuration commands you want to execute in a local file</a> (even in <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/02/store-your-eem-tcl-policies-in-nvram.html">NVRAM</a>) or you could execute them directly off a file server (using HTTP, FTP, TFTP or SCP protocol).</p>
