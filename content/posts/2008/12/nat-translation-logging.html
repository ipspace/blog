<div class="bloggerBody"><p>The <strong>ip nat log translations syslog </strong>command starts NAT logging: every NAT translation created on the router is logged in <em>syslog</em> (which can be sent to console, <em>syslog</em> host or internal buffer). You could use this command as a poor man’s reporting tool if you have to monitor the address translations on your edge routers (for example, due to security policy or auditing requirements). Obviously you should configure the <strong>no logging console </strong>first in a production environment; otherwise your router will hang a few moments after you’ve enabled NAT logging.</p>
<!--more--><p>The logging printouts include:</p>
<ul class="Bullet1"><li>layer-4 protocol;</li>
<li>inside local and global addresses and port numbers;</li>
<li>outside local and global addresses and port numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>For example, the following messages were logged when an inside host 10.0.0.1 tried to access web server at the IP address 192.168.0.1. The inside source address 10.0.0.1 was translated through a NAT pool (configured with <strong>ip nat inside source list </strong><strong><em>ACL </em></strong><strong>pool </strong><strong><em>POOL </em></strong>command) into 10.17.3.32 and the inside destination address 192.168.0.1 was translated into outside destination address 10.17.3.2  (configured with <strong>ip nat outside source static </strong>command).</p>

<p class="note">Does it sound weird to specify the destination address translation with the <strong>ip nat outside source </strong>configuration command? It does to me …</p>
