Thanks to everyone who took time to participate in my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/11/how-should-i-cover-ace-xml-gateway-and.html">“ACE XML Gateway” poll</a> (and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/11/stuffing-polls-adventures-of-convoluted.html">special thanks to our anonymous friend from Poland</a> who <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/11/stuffing-polls-adventures-of-convoluted.html?showComment=1227647160000">amused numerous readers</a> and helped me set up slightly more secure polls). A large majority (with the notable and vocal exception of the previously-mentioned anonymous contributor) would like to see posts (or at least pointers to them) in the IOS Hints blog:<br/><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/2008/12/acevotes.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="/2008/12/s400-acevotes.png"/></a></div>
