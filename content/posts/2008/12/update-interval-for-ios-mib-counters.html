Dear readers! This time I really need your help (uncle Google and his relatives gave me <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/cisco-nsp@puck.nether.net/msg09644.html">only one relevant hit</a> and even that doesn't work on 7200 or 1800).<br/><br/>I'm trying to implement an EEM applet that would detect traffic rate change using CISCO-CLASS-BASED-QOS-MIB. Everything would work perfectly ... if only IOS wouldn't update the MIB counters approximately every 10 seconds, not in real-time. Is anyone aware of a configuration command that would force the router to update these counters any faster?
