It looks like the wording in the &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2008/12/nat-translated-dns-responses-are-not.html">NAT-translated DNS responses are not cacheable</a>&rdquo; post was a bit too vague, as some readers understood the router would mess the TTL field in the DNS response payload when changing the IP addresses in the IP header of the response packet. <br /><br />That's not the case; the TTL field in the DNS response payload is touched only if the router performs application-layer translation of the DNS response (for example, changing the A record in the DNS response). I've reworded the original post; I can only hope I've made it unambiguous (after all, English is not my native language).
