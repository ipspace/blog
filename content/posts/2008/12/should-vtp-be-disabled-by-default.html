<p>One of my readers sent me a question that triggered one of my old grudges:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">In my experience, when you first add a new switch (having a NULL domain) on an existing VTP Domain, it inherits the domain name, regardless of it being a VTP Server. I was wondering if this is a feature (i.e. has proved to be a solution in most cases) or a bug (i.e. has proved to cause problems in most cases). I know it's proved to be the latter for us!</blockquote>
<p>In my personal opinion Cisco at one point in time wanted too much plug-and-play and someone had a great idea that you can just plug another switch into your network and it would autoconfigure itself. We've been suffering because of that "insight" ever since (and the CCIE written test has material for a few more interesting questions :).</p>
<p>I strongly believe that VTP should be turned off by default and should generate a warning before being enabled, but it will probably not happen. What do you think?</p>
<p class="warn">Disclaimer: I am not a switching person and have no idea about anything below or above layer 3.</p>
