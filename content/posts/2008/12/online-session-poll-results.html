I would like to thank everyone that took time and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/11/online-sessions-in-december-2008-please.html">voted on the subject of my next on-line session</a>. We have a clear winner: Dynamic routing across a firewall … although the closeness of the other topics might indicate a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/11/stuffing-polls-adventures-of-convoluted.html">helping hand of our polish friend</a>. Unfortunately, I have some bad news to go with the good ones – the “December” session will most likely happen in January or February (I'm simply running out of time).<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center; margin-top: 1em;"><a href="/2008/12/SessionPoll.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="/2008/12/s400-SessionPoll.png"/></a></div>
