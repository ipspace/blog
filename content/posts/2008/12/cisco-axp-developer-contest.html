<div class="bloggerBody"><p>Do you have a great idea what a router should be able to do, but you cannot make it work because you can't tweak router's embedded management tools (including Tcl)? Here is an opportunity you shouldn't miss: enroll in the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/solutions/axpdev/index.html">Cisco AXP Developer Contest</a>. Even if you're absolutely positive that having an extra Linux server sitting next to the router is <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/solutions/axpdev/gs.html">better than a router blade</a> (and <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2008/04/hot-air-party.html">some Linux pundits had lots to say on the topic</a>), sending your ideas to Cisco won't cost you more than a few moments of your time and an e-mail ;)</p>
<p>And, BTW, mundane (but nonetheless highly useful) ideas like »visual policy map editor« or truly integrated DNS/DHCP server probably won't get you very far (that's why I'm not applying :).</p>
<p class="disclaimer">Full disclosure: I was kindly asked if I could help spreading the word about the contest, but all the enthusiasm is exclusively mine.</p>
