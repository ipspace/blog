It looks like everyone has better things to do after the summer holidays than providing free content to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere">blogosphere</a>. The only really interesting post I found was <a href="http://www.colinmcnamara.com/2008/09/09/measuring-and-mitigating-risk-involved-with-sharing-virtual-infrastructure-between-dmz-and-internal-environments">Colin McNamara's response</a> to my DMZ VLAN post, in which he looks at the much bigger picture: it's not only the switching infrastructure we're sharing; in the virtualization rush, we're sharing memory, disks, interfaces and even firewalls.
