<p>The <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3101#page-6">RFC 3101</a> (OSPF NSSA Option) states:</p>
<blockquote class='cite'>In addition, an NSSA border router should originate a default LSA (IP network is 0.0.0.0/0) into the NSSA.  Default routes are necessary because NSSAs do not receive full routing information and must have a default route in order to route to AS-external destinations. </blockquote>
<p>I am pretty sure that IOS inserted the type-7 default route into an NSSA area when the NSSA feature was introduced.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>However, at least in some Cisco IOS 12.x releases, you have to configure the type-7 default route origination explicitly with the <b>area nssa default-information-originate </b>router configuration command, in which you can also specify the route metric and metric type (N1 or N2). Entering the <b>area <i>xx </i>nssa </b>without the <b>default-information-originate </b>keyword will result in an NSSA area with no connectivity to external destinations redistributed into OSPF in other areas.</p>
