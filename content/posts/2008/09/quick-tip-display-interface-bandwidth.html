<div class="bloggerBody"><p>To display bandwidths of all interfaces configured on the router use <strong>show interface | include protocol|BW</strong> command. </p>
<p></p>
<!--more--><p>Here is a sample printout:</p>
<pre class="code">Rtr#<b>show interface | include protocol|BW</b><br/>FastEthernet0/0 is administratively down, line protocol is down<br/>  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 100000 Kbit, DLY 100 usec,<br/>Serial1/0 is up, line protocol is up<br/>  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 2000 Kbit, DLY 20000 usec,<br/>Serial1/1 is up, line protocol is up<br/>  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 2000 Kbit, DLY 20000 usec,<br/>Serial1/2 is up, line protocol is up<br/>  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 2000 Kbit, DLY 20000 usec,<br/>Serial1/3 is administratively down, line protocol is down<br/>  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 1544 Kbit, DLY 20000 usec,<br/>Loopback0 is up, line protocol is up<br/>  MTU 1514 bytes, BW 8000000 Kbit, DLY 5000 usec,</pre><p class="Info">You could <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/01/define-new-ios-commands-with-alias.html">define an alias</a> to create a new IOS command generating this printout (for example, <strong>alias exec bw show interface | include protocol|BW</strong>). You could also <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/06/simple-extensions-to-exec-mode-cli.html">write a simple Tcl script</a> that would accept an interface name and display the bandwidth of that interface.</p>
