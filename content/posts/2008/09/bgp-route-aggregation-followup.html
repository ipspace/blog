A week ago I've asked whether <a href="/2008/08/do-you-have-good-reason-to-use-bgp.html">anyone has a good use for BGP aggregation</a>. Out of 1300 daily visitors of my blog and 2200 subscribers to the RSS feed,  four (4) people found the time and energy to reply. Thank you for your thoughts!<br/><br/>Let me conclude that BGP aggregation is not widely used (so I will spend much energy covering it in my future posts) ... all the other potential conclusions are too pessimistic.
