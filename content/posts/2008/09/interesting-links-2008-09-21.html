The blogosphere is amazing: I was complaining about lack of posts a week ago, but the last days were a real bonanza:<br/><ul><li>Jeremy Stretch started writing about BGP aggregation. So far he's covered <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2008/sep/19/bgp-route-aggregation-part-1/">the principles</a> and <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2008/sep/20/bgp-route-aggregation-part-2/">the route suppression options</a>. Unfortunately, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/08/do-you-have-good-reason-to-use-bgp.html">my question</a> <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/09/bgp-route-aggregation-followup.html">still remains unanswered</a>: why would you use these tweaks in a well-designed network?</li>
<li>Anthony Sequeira started to explain the QoS mechanisms on PIX/ASA. So far he's covered the <a href="http://blog.internetworkexpert.com/2008/09/12/qos-on-the-pixasa-part-1what-tools-are-available/">overview</a>, <a href="http://blog.internetworkexpert.com/2008/09/15/qos-on-the-pixasa-%e2%80%93-part-2the-modular-policy-framework/">modular framework</a>, <a href="http://blog.internetworkexpert.com/2008/09/16/qos-on-the-pixasa-%e2%80%93-part-3priority-queuing/">priority queuing</a> and <a href="http://blog.internetworkexpert.com/2008/09/20/qos-on-the-pixasa-%e2%80%93-part-4traffic-shaping-and-traffic-policing/">traffic shaping</a>. Now we're waiting for part 5 of another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Novels">trilogy in four parts</a>.</li>
<li>Joe Harris was bored during the meetings (his words, not mine) and preferred to focus on <a href="http://6200networks.com/2008/09/09/ios-configuration-lock/">IOS configuration lock</a> and <a href="http://6200networks.com/2008/09/17/configuration-generation-performance-enhancement/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Configuration Generation Performance Enhancement">Configuration Generation Performance Enhancement</a>. Now we know why some people @ Cisco hate Dynamips: SEs have found yet another way to survive the boring meetings :).</li>
<li>Greg Ferro described how <a href="http://etherealmind.com/2008/09/12/tcp-syn-cookies-ddos-defence/">TCP SYN cookies work</a> and provided <a href="http://etherealmind.com/2008/09/18/difference-between-server-network-engineers/">interesting insight into the brain maps of network- and server engineers</a>, which is the first post you should read if you're depressed by the cloudy and cold autumn weather.<br/> </li>
