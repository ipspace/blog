<p>An <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/08/is-label-imposed-in-case-of-penultimate.html?showComment=1219355400000">anonymous commenter</a> to my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/08/is-label-imposed-in-case-of-penultimate.html">implicit NULL/PHP post</a> made a very valid point:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Most Cisco documentation states that you must enable LDP before doing MPLS-TE, which is a complete fallacy.</blockquote>
<p>If you're using MPLS TE simply to shift IP traffic around your network, he's absolutely right: there is no need to run LDP if you have an IP-only network. If you're running MPLS VPN or BGP on edges/MPLS in the core, the answer becomes “it depends.” The detailed rules and undesired side effects if you ignore them are summarized in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/MPLS_Traffic_Engineering_in_MPLS_VPN_environment">MPLS Traffic Engineering in MPLS VPN environment</a> article.<p style="text-align: right"><a href="http://wiki.nil.com/MPLS_Traffic_Engineering_in_MPLS_VPN_environment">Read the article</a> in <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT<sup>3</sup> wiki</a>.</p>
