End-to-end troubleshooting of MPLS VPN solutions is one of the more complex network troubleshooting tasks. On top of several sophisticated technologies and protocols used in MPLS VPN solutions, we have to deal with customer-to-provider interaction on the IP routing protocol level, which makes the troubleshooting efforts even more convoluted.

To minimize the impact of your customers on your troubleshooting efforts, you might want to start with the PE-to-PE troubleshooting. When used as the first step in your troubleshooting process, the PE-PE tests will bypass customer errors, intra-site customer routing problems, PE-CE interactions, and route redistribution issues.

The easiest way to perform PE-to-PE connectivity tests is to create a dummy VRF on the PE routers under consideration and test the connectivity between loopback interfaces assigned to the newly created VRF:

1.  Allocate a route distinguisher (RD) and route target (RT) that is not used anywhere else in the MPLS VPN domain.
2.  Create a VRF on one of the PE routers using the test RD and RT. Wait for the multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) network to converge.
3.  Inspect the BGP table associated with the selected RD (**show ip bgp vpnv4 rd _RD_**). The table should be empty indicating that no other VPN uses the same RD.
4.  Inspect the BGP table of the new VRF (**show ip bgp vpnv4 vrf _name_**). The table should be empty indicating that no other VPNv4 routes have the same RT.
5.  Create a loopback interface, assign it to the new VRF and give it an IP address.
6.  Create the BGP address family associated with the new VRF and redistribute connected routes into BGP. Two-way redistribution is not required as you’re not using a PE-CE routing protocol.
7.  Repeat steps 2, 5 and 6 on all other PE routers you want to test.

After the loopback IP addresses have been redistributed into MP-BGP and propagated throughout the network, you’re ready to start troubleshooting.

{{<note info>}}The end-to-end network convergence could take a significant amount of time (up to a few minutes, depending on your BGP setup).{{</note>}}

Perform these steps to verify PE-to-PE connectivity for the new VRF:

1.  Inspect the BGP table associated with the new VRF on all PE routers under test and verify that they contain all loopback addresses you’ve configured. Missing prefixes indicate BGP-related route propagation problems.
2.  Perform **traceroute** within the VRF with the **traceroute vrf _name destination_ source _source_** command. The **traceroute vrf** command will either display hop-by-hop path through the network or fail at the first hop regardless of the actual location of the problem.
3.  If the **traceroute** command fails, use the BGP table in the new VRF to find the next-hop addresses of the remote PE-routers. Perform [MPLS traceroute](/2007/06/mpls-ping-and-traceroute.html) toward the next-hop addresses to identify the actual location of the broken end-to-end LSP.

### Sample troubleshooting session

Sample MPLS VPN troubleshooting illustrated in this section is performed between the routers PE-A and PE-C in the following network.

{{<figure src="MPLS_Ping_Testbed.png" caption="Sample MPLS VPN network">}}

New RD (65000:101) and RT (65000:101) were allocated for test purposes. VRF *Test* is created on the PE-A:

```
ip vrf Test
 rd 65000:101
 route-target export 65000:101
 route-target import 65000:101
```

The new route targets configured on PE-A affect the automatic MP-BGP inbound filters. You should wait a few seconds before checking the BGP table for routes having test RD or RT. After you’ve confirmed that no existing routes in the MPLS VPN network use the test RD/RT, continue with the configuration. The final configuration of VRF *Test* on PE-A and PE-C is shown in the following listings:

{{<cc>}}Test VRF configuration on PE-A{{</cc>}}
```
PE-A#show running-config vrf Test

ip vrf Test

end
```

{{<note info>}}The **show running-config vrf** ***name*** command introduced in IOS releases 12.2(33)SRC and 12.4(20)T displays all parts of router configuration related to the specified VRF.{{</note>}}

end
```

When the BGP convergence completes, inspect the VPNv4 BGP entries associated with VRF *Test* on PE-A and PE-C. Both tables should contain two host routes:

{{<cc>}}Test VRF routing table on PE-A{{</cc>}}
```
PE-A#show ip bgp vpnv4 vrf Test
BGP table version is 5, local router ID is 10.0.1.1

```

Perform the **traceroute vrf** command on PE-A. In the sample network, the initial test has failed:

{{<cc>}}VRF trace route from PE-A to PE-C{{</cc>}}
```
PE-A#traceroute vrf Test 192.168.0.2 source 192.168.0.1

Type escape sequence to abort.

The **traceroute mpls** command should [reveal the source of the problem](/2007/06/mpls-ping-and-traceroute.html): in our scenario, it was an unlabeled interface between C4 and C3:

{{<cc>}}MPLS **traceroute** identified an unlabeled interface{{</cc>}}
```

After the **mpls ip** command was entered on the correct interface on C3, the end-to-end LSP was established and both **traceroute mpls** and **traceroute vrf** were able to reach PE-C from PE-A:

To complete the tests, you should perform the **traceroute vrf** test in the opposite direction (from PE-C toward PE-A).

{{<cc>}}VRF traceroute from VRF loopback on PE-C to VRF loopback on PE-A{{</cc>}}
