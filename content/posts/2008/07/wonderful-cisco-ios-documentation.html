I wanted to figure out the exact release when Cisco IOS got EBGP load-sharing. Fighting through Feature Navigator is a pain for me, so I usually check older IOS documentation, starting from the old <a href="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/home/home.htm">UniverCD URL</a> (I was able to remember that one, the new URLs don't make any sense to me). When I've selected IOS release 11.0 configuration guides, the system redirected me to the "new style" <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/11_0/router/configuration/guide/cbook.html">11.0 Router Products Configuration Guide</a> ... and it looks like IOS did not support IP in release 11.0 :) ... or at least there are no instructions on how to configure it.<br/><br/>It's really sad how Cisco handles documentation these days. First they'd moved everything to new addresses and implemented redirects that didn't work (this is mostly fixed now), now they've managed to lose important parts of documentation.
