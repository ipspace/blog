If you have to troubleshoot routers with long configurations, you're probably as fed up with the slow response of the <strong>show running-config</strong> command as I am. Unfortunately, there's not much you can do; the running configuration is reverse-engineered from various memory variables every time you ask for it and that process simply takes time if you've configured many parameters.<br/><br/>IOS release 12.2(33)SRB has introduced a fantastic feature: <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2sr/12_2srb/feature/guide/cnfprts.html">router configuration partitioning</a>. The early seeds of this idea are already present in mainstream IOS releases. For example, you can <a href="/2007/03/display-configuration-of-single.html">display the configuration of a single interface</a>, all class-maps or all policy-maps. The configuration partitioning gives you the ability to display access-lists, route-maps, static routes, router configurations ...<!--more-->The following printout shows you the various parts of router configuration you can display:<pre class="code">PE-A#<b>show running-config partition ?</b><br/>  access-list       All access-list configurations<br/>  class-map         All class-map configurations<br/>  common            All remaining unregistered configurations<br/>  global-cdp        All global cdp configurations<br/>  interface         Each Interface specific Configurations<br/>  ip-as-path        All IP as-path configurations<br/>  ip-community      All IP community list configurations<br/>  ip-domain-list    All ip domain list configurations<br/>  ip-prefix-list    All ip prefix-list configurations<br/>  ip-static-routes  All IP static configurations<br/>  line              All line mode configurations<br/>  policy-map        All policy-map configurations<br/>  route-map         All route-map configurations<br/>  router            All routing configurations<br/>  snmp              All SNMP configurations<br/>  tacacs            All TACACS configurations<br/></pre>For example, if you want to display just the configuration of the OSPF process, you'd ask for <strong>show running partition router ospf 1</strong>:<pre class="code">PE-A#<b>show running partition router ospf 1</b><br/>Building configuration...<br/><br/>Current configuration : 164 bytes<br/>!<br/>Configuration of Partition - router ospf 1<br/>!<br/>!<br/>router ospf 1<br/> log-adjacency-changes<br/> passive-interface Serial1/1<br/> network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0<br/>!<br/>!<br/>end</pre>
