title: The value of being a CCIE

<div class="bloggerBody"><p>I was very pleasantly surprised by the supportive comments to my CCIE-related post; I didn’t realize there are so many CCIEs out there that feel the same way I do. Will we change anything? We can only hope; the CCIE program is orders of magnitude smaller than the Cisco’s equipment sales.</p>
<p>A few of the comments also asked for my opinion on the value of CCIE certification and whether it’s worth pursuing. Obviously, the short answer is <em>yes</em>. </p>
<!--more--><p>CCIE certification has “commercial” as well as “academic” value. Undoubtedly, being a CCIE will (on average) increase your chances of getting a better-paid job. If you’re looking for jobs where the CCIE certification could help, you absolutely have to maintain the <em>active </em>status. For example, if you want to work for a Cisco’s partner, your CCIE status brings value only if you’re an active CCIE (suspended or inactive CCIEs don’t count toward the CCIE quota Cisco partners have to maintain). This requirement makes sense: partner CCIEs are usually faced with critical production problems in customer networks and thus have to hone their skills continuously. </p>
<p class="info">Conclusion: if you’ve just got your CCIE certification, make sure you re-certify a few times; losing the <em>active </em>status would destroy the value you’ve been working so hard to create.</p>
<p>The “academic” value of the CCIE certification is also worth mentioning: it’s one of the few certifications that you simply cannot fake with the help of brain dumps. If you want to prove to yourself (and others) that you can reach the expert level in networking, go for CCIE or JNCIE (anyone aware of any other certifications that involve a day in an actual lab?). Of course, once you’ve become CCIE, it is worthless discussing whether you’re still a CCIE if you haven’t recertified (<a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/?q=node/15742">only certification zealots have problems with this concept</a>). If you’ve got a PhD in physics, nobody will question whether you should still have the degree if you don’t work with particle accelerators; it’s the same with the CCIE certification (although Cisco is mysteriously vague on this topic).</p>
<p>Last but not least, the traffic logs have undoubtedly proved that I should stop writing about technology: the daily visits have jumped on July 1st and stayed higher-than-average for the next two days.</p>
