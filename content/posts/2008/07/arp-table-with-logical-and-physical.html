In a layer-3 switching environment, the ARP table displayed with the <strong>show arp</strong> command lists the logical (L3) interfaces, for example the VLAN or BVI interface. <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/ARP_table_display">This Tcl script</a> displays the logical as well as physical interface associated with each IP/MAC address.<p class="info">Martin Hecko <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/01/youve-asked-for-it-series.html">gave me the idea for this script</a> and helped to test it on a Catalyst switch. Thank you!</p>
