<p>Shahid has sent me an interesting observation: he was running RIP in partially-meshed Frame Relay network and wanted to use static host routes to fix next-hop problems, but somehow they didn't work as expected. I ran a series of scenarios testing RIP, OSPF, EIGRP and BGP and found that some of the old tricks don't work any more. Furthermore, it's almost impossible to run RIP over partially-meshed NBMA network, as the default RIP next-hop processing messes up your routing table. The details are explained in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Next-hop_fixup_in_partially-meshed_NBMA_networks">Next-hop fixup in partially-meshed NBMA networks</a> article in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT<sup>3</sup> wiki</a>.</p>
