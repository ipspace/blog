Policing implementations in Cisco IOS are a bit confusing: IOS supports three different algorithms that are configured with very similar parameters of the **police** command in modular QoS CLI. There\'s also the older **rate-limit** command that uses a limited implementation of one of the three algorithms. You\'ll find all policing details, including the graphic representations of all three algorithms in the [QoS Policing in Cisco IOS](/kb/tag/QoS/QoS_Policing/) article.
