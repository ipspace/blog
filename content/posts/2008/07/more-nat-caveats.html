<div class="bloggerBody"><p>A month ago I wrote about <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/06/nat-caveats-in-ios-release-124t.html">NAT caveats in Cisco IOS release 12.4</a> that occur when the outside addresses match IP access list or route map used in <strong>ip nat inside </strong>command. I recently discovered more caveats: if you have an inbound access-list on the outside interface, the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/NAT_caveats_in_IOS_release_12.4T#Packets_rejected_by_inbound_ACL_generate_NAT_translations">packets dropped by the access-list still generate NAT entries</a> (and might result in a denial-of-service attack when the router runs out of port numbers). You can <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/NAT_caveats_in_IOS_release_12.4T">read the whole NAT caveats article</a> in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT<sup>3</sup> wiki</a>.</p>
