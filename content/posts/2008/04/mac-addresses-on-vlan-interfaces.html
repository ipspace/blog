<a href="http://cciepursuit.wordpress.com/about/">CCIE Pursuit</a> writes about the <a href="http://cciepursuit.wordpress.com/2008/04/21/beware-the-man-of-one-platform/">usage of MAC addresses on SVI (VLAN) interfaces on various Catalyst switches</a>. Some switches might reuse the same MAC address on multiple VLANs, leading to interesting problems if another box bridges those VLANs (for example, a transparent firewall).
