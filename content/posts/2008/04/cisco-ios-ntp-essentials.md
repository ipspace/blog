A while ago I\'ve been involved in an interesting discussion focusing on NTP authentication and whether you can actually implement it reliably on Cisco IOS. What I got out of it (apart from a working example :) was the feeling that NTP and it\'s implementation in Cisco IOS was under-understood and under-documented, so I planned to write an article about it.

However, as I did my research, I figured out there\'s so much I didn\'t know about NTP (do you know what\'s the essential difference between a *peer* and a *server*?) that I decided to write *It's Good to be on Time* article -- you'll find it [somewhere in this list](/kb/Internet/).
