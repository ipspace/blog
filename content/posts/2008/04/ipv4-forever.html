One of the obscure facts of IPv6 OSPF (OSPFv3) is that it uses a 32-bit router ID like OSPFv2. It's a reasonable choice, I haven't seen an OSPF network with more than a billion routers yet. However, could you guess how this requirement is implemented in Cisco IOS? <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/10/ospf-router-id-does-not-change-when.html">OSPFv3 searches for an IPv4 address</a> (effectively the same algorithm used by OSPFv2) to get the router ID for the IPv6 routing process. Neat, isn't it?<br/><br/>You might wonder what happens if you want to configure an IPv6-only router. OSPF won't start unless you configure the router ID manually. And, no, you cannot enter a number (which would be the expected format, as the router ID is just a number in the IPv6 world), you have to enter an IPv4 address. Long live IPv4 :))<!--more-->Here is a sample printout from a router. First, let's check the interface status:<pre class="code">Site-D(config)#<strong>do show ip interface brief</strong><br/>Interface           IP-Address      OK? Method Status    Protocol<br/>FastEthernet0/0     unassigned      YES manual up        up      <br/>FastEthernet0/1     unassigned      YES manual up        up      <br/>Loopback0           unassigned      YES manual up        up</pre>No IPv4 running anywhere. Good. Let's continue and configure IPv6:<pre class="code">Site-D(config)#<strong>ipv6 unicast</strong><br/>Site-D(config)#<strong>ipv6 router ospf 1</strong><br/>Site-D(config-rtr)#<br/>*Mar  1 01:18:46.423: %OSPFv3-4-NORTRID: OSPFv3 process 1 could not pick a router-id,<br/>please configure manually</pre>Oops, IPv6 OSPF won't start if the router doesn't have an IPv4 address. Let's configure the router ID:<pre class="code">Site-D(config-rtr)#<strong>router-id ?</strong><br/><span class="high">  A.B.C.D  OSPF router-id in IP address format</span><br/><br/>Site-D(config-rtr)#router-id 10.0.1.8<br/>Site-D(config-rtr)#</pre><p class="info">If you're a Cisco partner, you can run the <a href="http://cisco.partnerelearning.com/pec/Direct.asp?URL=2021135259965.1626">Configuring OSPFv3</a> remote lab exercise <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/02/ipv6-remote-labs-on-partner-education.html">free-of-charge from Partner Education Connection</a>.
