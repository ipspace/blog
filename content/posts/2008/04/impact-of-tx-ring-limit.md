Setting the [size of the hardware output queue in Cisco IOS](https://www.ipspace.net/kb/tag/QoS/Queuing_Principles.html) with the (then undocumented) **tx-ring-limit** (formerly known as **tx-limit**) has been a big deal when I was developing the first version of the QoS course that eventually became the initial release of the *Implementing Cisco Quality of Service* training.

However, while it\'s intuitively clear that the longer hardware queue affects the QoS, years passed before I finally took the time to [measure the actual impact](https://www.ipspace.net/kb/tag/QoS/TX-Ring-Limit.html).
