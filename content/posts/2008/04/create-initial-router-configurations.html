<p>I've always considered building (almost identical) initial router configurations a waste of time, more so when I had to enter them manually, enabling interfaces, configuring IP addresses and Frame Relay subinterfaces on the fly â€¦ as well as entering <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/01/simplify-your-lab-work.html">dozens of commands</a> that I feel should be present in every router configuration.</p>
<p>When I finally had enough, I've stopped my non-critical lab tests for a few weeks (that's why there's still no answer on the very good question whether the NBAR started by NAT is of any use) and wrote <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Configuration_maker">configMaker</a>: a PERL script that parses <a href="http://www.dynagen.org/">dynagen</a> lab topology and produces initial router configurations based on a template file that you can adjust to your own needs. <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Configuration_maker">Read more about it</a> in the <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/">CT<sup>3</sup> wiki</a>.</p>
