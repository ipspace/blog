title: RFC 3514 implemented by the ASR series of routers

The information on the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/routers/ps9343/product_bulletin_c25-448387.html">IOS XE software</a> used by the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9343/index.html">recently launched ASR 1000 router</a> is pretty scarce (there is still no link to the documentation available on CCO), but obviously some backdoor links already exist, as I was able to find some IOS XE-related documents with Google. One of the most amazing features I've found is the support for the security-oriented <a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc3514.txt">RFC 3514</a> which allows you to mark the security level of an IP packet.<br/><br/>The RFC 3514 requires the end host to participate in the process, but as most operating system vendors still don't have a trusted computing platform, a transparent proxy has to be implemented on the network edges to properly tag the ingress packets. ASR 1000 has the first high-speed implementation of the RFC 3514 proxy thanks to its non-deterministic parallel <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/routers/ps9343/data_sheet_c78-450070.html">QuantumFlow processors</a>.<br/><br/>The configuration of the RFC 3514 proxy is extremely simple: all you need to do is to configure <strong>auto-secure mark</strong> on the ingress interfaces of the ASR 1000. Once the security bit has been set, you can use the <strong>match ip security-bit 0|1</strong> command in a <strong>class-map</strong> or a <strong>route-map</strong> on any router running IOS release 12.4(11)T or later (the command is still hidden).
