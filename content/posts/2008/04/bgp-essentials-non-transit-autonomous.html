It's evident from the comments to my previous post on the <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2008/04/bgp-essentials-non-transit-as.html">non-transit AS implementation</a> that I forgot to do my homework: I jumped straight into the implementation details without explaining the basics of non-transit AS and associated design rules. I hope I did a better job in a short article “<a href="http://wiki.nil.com/%28Non%29Transit_Autonomous_System">(Non)Transit Autonomous System</a>” which starts with the definition, describes the usual challenges of multi-homed end-users and the non-transit AS design and (at the very end) its implementation.<p class="info">Cisco partners can test the non-transit AS implementation in the <a href="http://cisco.partnerelearning.com/pec/Direct.asp?URL=20111027237185.1336">Using Multihomed BGP Networks</a> and <a href="http://cisco.partnerelearning.com/pec/Direct.asp?URL=20111033262035.1810">Employing AS - Path Filters</a> remote lab exercises.
