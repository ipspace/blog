If you think this behavior might affect your network, it's best you test the details in a controlled lab environment. Our <a href="http://www.nil.com/catalog/OSPFDistanceVector">OSPF quick learning module</a> will tell you how to tweak the OSPF parameters and how to prevent IP prefix reappearance in the original area. The blended solution also includes a remote lab exercise, where you can test the IOS behavior on actual routers.<p class='info'>E-lessons are subscription-based; you can repeat each module in the lesson (including the lab) as many times as needed.</p>
