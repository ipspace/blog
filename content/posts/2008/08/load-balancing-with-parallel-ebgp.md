title: Load Balancing with Parallel EBGP Sessions

Establishing parallel EBGP sessions across parallel links between two edge routers (EBGP peers) -- as displayed in the diagram below -- is the most versatile form of EBGP load balancing. It does not require static routing or extra routing protocol (like the design running EBGP between routers’ loopback interfaces), device-specific tricks like configuring the same IP address on multiple interfaces) or specific layer-2 encapsulation (like Ethernet LAG or Multilink PPP).

It even allows proportional load-balancing across unequal-bandwidth links and combinations of various layer-2 technologies (for example, load-balancing between a serial line and an Ethernet interface). The only drawback of this design is the increased size of the BGP table, as every BGP prefix is received from the EBGP neighbor twice.

**Benefits**

-   No extra routing protocol between EBGP neighbors
-   Reliably detects link and node failures
-   No IP addressing tricks
-   No dependency on layer-2 transport technology
-   Load balancing proportional to link bandwidth

**Drawbacks**

-   Duplicate entries in the BGP table increase memory requirements
-   Additional BGP session and larger BGP table increases CPU utilization

### Basic configuration

To implement parallel EBGP sessions, configure multiple **neighbors** on both EBGP routers, one for each IP subnet (parallel link between the EBGP peers) and enable EBGP multipath load balancing with the **maximum-paths** router configuration command. Sample router configurations are shown below:

{{<cc>}}Configuration of PE-1{{</cc>}}
```
hostname PE-A
!
interface Loopback0
 ip address 10.0.1.1 255.255.255.255
!
interface Serial1/4
 description Link #1 to PE-B
 bandwidth 1000
 ip address 10.0.7.37 255.255.255.252
 encapsulation ppp
!
interface Serial1/5
 description Link #2 to PE-B
 bandwidth 4000
 ip address 10.0.7.45 255.255.255.252
 encapsulation ppp
!
router bgp 65000
 no synchronization
 bgp log-neighbor-changes
 neighbor 10.0.7.38 remote-as 65001
 neighbor 10.0.7.46 remote-as 65001
 maximum-paths 8
```

{{<cc>}}Configuration of PE-B{{</cc>}}
```
hostname PE-B
!
interface Loopback0
 ip address 10.0.1.5 255.255.255.255
!
interface Serial1/0
 description Link #1 to PE-A
 bandwidth 1000
 ip address 10.0.7.38 255.255.255.252
 encapsulation ppp
!
interface Serial1/1
 description Link #2 to PE-A
 bandwidth 4000
 ip address 10.0.7.46 255.255.255.252
 encapsulation ppp
!
router bgp 65001
 no synchronization
 bgp log-neighbor-changes
 neighbor 10.0.7.37 remote-as 65000
 neighbor 10.0.7.45 remote-as 65000
 maximum-paths 8
```

After the neighbors have been configured, inspect the BGP neighbor table with the **show ip bgp summary** command. All parallel sessions should be operational.

{{<cc>}}BGP sessions on PE-A{{</cc>}}
```
PE-A#show ip bgp summary | begin Neighbor
Neighbor        V    AS MsgRcvd MsgSent   TblVer  InQ OutQ Up/Down  State/PfxRcd
10.0.7.38       4 65001       4       4        2    0    0 00:01:24        1
10.0.7.46       4 65001       4       4        2    0    0 00:01:24        1
```

Check the prefixes advertised by the EBGP peer with the **show ip bgp _prefix_** and **show ip route _prefix_** commands:

{{<cc>}}BGP table on PE-A{{</cc>}}
```
PE-A#show ip bgp 10.2.2.0

```

### Bandwidth-proportional load balancing

Configure [DMZ Link Bandwidth](/2008/07/unequal-bandwidth-ebgp-load-balancing.html) feature to enable load balancing proportional to the bandwidth of the parallel links:

-   Configure **neighbor _ip-address_ dmzlink-bw** on all EBGP sessions with the EBGP peer router.
-   Configure proportional load sharing with the **bgp dmzlink-bw** router configuration command.

Modifications to the PE-A router configuration are shown below:

{{<cc>}}Enabling DMZ Link Bandwidth on PE-A{{</cc>}}
```
router bgp 65000
 bgp dmzlink-bw
 neighbor 10.0.7.38 dmzlink-bw
 neighbor 10.0.7.46 dmzlink-bw
```

After you’ve enabled the DMZ Link Bandwidth feature, you have to clear the EBGP sessions with the **clear ip bgp _address_ soft in** command. As before, you can check the load balancing behavior with the **show ip bgp _prefix_** and **show ip route _prefix_** commands.
