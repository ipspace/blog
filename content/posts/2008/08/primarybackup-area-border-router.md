It's possible to design OSPF area boundaries to have primary- and backup Area Border Routers. I described the details in a long-gone article, and fortunately [found its shadow (without the diagrams) on archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20160315080312/http://wiki.nil.com/Primary/backup_area_border_router_designs).
