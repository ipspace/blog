For the last 10 years, I've been <a href="/2008/01/bgp-essentials-advertising-public-ip/">preaching that you should use static BGP prefix advertising</a> (with the <b>network mask </b>router configuration command) to advertise your IP address space into the public Internet, not the BGP aggregation. I might see some use for BGP aggregation in enterprise networks (or MPLS VPN networks) using BGP as the core routing protocol with other routing protocols serving the edge, but I cannot find a good scenario where BGP aggregation in public Internet would be a good solution. Do you use BGP aggregation in your network? Do you have a good scenario that you'd like to share with us? Write a comment.
