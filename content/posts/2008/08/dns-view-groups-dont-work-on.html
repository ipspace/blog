<div class="bloggerBody"><p>Working on an implementation of a split DNS design, I encountered an interesting bug in Cisco IOS: the <strong>ip</strong><strong> </strong><strong>dns</strong><strong> view-group</strong> command works only on interfaces, but not on subinterfaces. As it’s a pure IP feature, there obviously no reason why it shouldn’t work on anything that has an IP address; obviously someone forgot to insert the correct entry in the parser tables.</p>
<!--more--><p>Here’s a sample configuration session taken from a 7200-series router running IOS release 12.4(15)T5:</p>
