<p>I tend to forget whether I'm in configuration mode or not and often <a href="/2008/06/fix-do-command/">type the <b>do</b> command in exec mode</a> or the <b>show</b> command in configuration modes. With the <b>alias</b> functionality you can make the <b>show</b> command a <em>native</em> command in the configuration modes; just configure <b>alias configure show do show</b>.</p>
<p class="note">The “only” drawback of this approach is that IOS has zillion different configuration modes and you have to define the alias in each one of them (you could do it just in the most common ones … or try to remember to type the <b>do</b> keyword first :).</p>
