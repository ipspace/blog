Ken McCoy sent me a short question: <blockquote class="cite">At one point someone posted an article about a command you could run on the Catalyst switch that would give you back the distance of the cable between the switch and end device, but now I can't find it.</blockquote>I remembered reading the same article and after I've figured out the underlying technology is called TDR (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-domain_reflectometer">Time Domain Reflectometer</a>), uncle Google immediately provided a <a href="http://supportwiki.cisco.com/ViewWiki/index.php/Tech_Insights:Cool_Tool_for_Solving_Layer_1_Cable_Issues">reader tip from Csaba Farkas</a>. <div class="more">This article is part of <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/01/youve-asked-for-it-series.html">You've asked for it</a> <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/search/label/You%27ve%20asked%20for%20it">series</a>.</div>
