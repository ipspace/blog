<div class="bloggerBody"><p>I've got an interesting question from Colin a while ago:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I would like to generate a different prompt during the login to the router if the TACACS+ server has failed, indicating to the network operators that they have to log-in with the special (local) username, not with the TACACS+ authenticated username/password.</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately he was running TACACS+ which supplies its own prompts during the authentication phase (the solution would not work with RADIUS). If you change the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/04/change-usernamepassword-prompt-with-aaa.html">local authentication prompts</a>, you'll get the prompts from TACACS+ server if it's reachable from the router (the AAA authentication is performed via TACACS+ server) and the local prompts if the TACACS+ server has failed (the AAA authentication is performed via any other mechanism). Here's a sample configuration:</p>
<pre class="code">aaa new-model<br/>aaa authentication login REMOTE group tacacs+ local<br/>!<br>aaa authentication fail-message #<br/>Local authentication failed. <br/>#<br/>aaa authentication password-prompt "Enter local password:"<br/>aaa authentication username-prompt "Enter local username:"<br>!<br>user a secret b<br/>!<br>line vty 0 4<br> login authentication REMOTE</br></br></br></br></br></pre></div>
