It looks like some people forgot that July and August are supposed to be summer months when everyone is off to the nearest beach enjoying the sun (or maybe the global warning has caused unusually rainy weather in some parts of the globe). Leading the pack is Petr Lapukhov (a few more weeks like this and I'll start suspecting he's actually an pseudonym for a group of people like <a href="http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=53523">Tony Li</a> was rumored to be a decade ago), who described <a href="http://blog.internetworkexpert.com/2008/07/17/pvst-explained/">Per-VLAN spanning tree (PVST) protocol</a>, <a href="http://blog.internetworkexpert.com/2008/07/27/mstp-tutorial-part-i-inside-a-region/">Multiple Spanning Trees Protocol (MSTP)</a> and <a href="http://blog.internetworkexpert.com/2008/08/02/dmvpn-explained/">Dynamic Multipoint VPNs (DMVPN)</a> (this one is so long I'll probably never find the willpower to read it) <br/><br/><a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2008/jul/23/dynamic-multipoint-vpn-dmvpn/">DMVPN</a> is also covered by Jeremy Stretch (I'm starting to wonder what's the root cause for the sudden fascination with this solution), who also provided a nice <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2008/aug/04/eui-64-ipv6/">introduction to EUI-64 IPv6 addresses</a>, a very practical view on <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2008/jul/30/policing-versus-shaping/">shaping-versus-policing dilemma</a> and simple <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2008/aug/06/simple-wired-8021x-lab/">step-by-step introduction to 802.1X</a>.<br/><br/>As one would expect, Joe Harris and Arden Packeer are also ignoring the summer temptations. Joe provided an interesting link to the <a href="http://6200networks.com/2008/08/01/ccde-practical-exam-demo/">CCDE practical exam demo</a> and Arden is continuing with his "<a href="http://ardenpackeer.com/routing-protocols/tutorial-ospf-network-types-and-frame-relay-part-5/">OSPF over Frame Relay</a>" saga (a few more installments and he'll be getting close to Jordan's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time">Wheel of Time</a>).<br/><br/>And last but not least: Tim Riegert sent me a link to a page full of <a href="http://www.eventhelix.com/RealtimeMantra/Networking/">TCP/IP and IMS Sequence Diagrams</a>. The diagrams serve as a demonstration of EventStudio System Designer capabilities, but they are still good.
