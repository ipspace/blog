The <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/03/execute-show-commands-while-configuring.html"><b>do</b> command available in configuration modes of Cisco IOS</a> is probably one of the best features ever implemented in IOS, but you tend to continue typing the <b>do</b> keyword even in the exec mode, resulting in syntax errors. The <b>alias</b> command doesn't help as you cannot specify an empty command line. However, there is a Tcl-based workaround.<!--more-->Store the following Tcl code in <em>flash:do.tcl</em>:<pre class="code">puts [exec $argv]<br/></pre>Configure <b>alias <span style="color: #C00">exec</span> do tclsh flash:do.tcl</b> and you can execute the <b>do</b> command from exec mode.<p class="note">The simple solution does not page the output, a lot more work would be needed to implement the proper paging functionality</p>
