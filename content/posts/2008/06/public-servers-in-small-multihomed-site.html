If you don't have your own public IP address space and your own AS number, you should try to become <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Multihoming_to_one_ISP">multihomed to one ISP</a> (or change your ISP if they don't know what you're talking about). If you want to be multi-homed to two ISPs using techniques similar to the ones I've described in the <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/SmallSiteMultiHoming/">Small-Site Multi-Homing</a> article, you should be using a hosted service (they're probably cheaper than your time), not your own public server. <br/><br/>But if you still insist (like numerous readers of my articles) to deploy public servers on a site multi-homed via NAT, you'll find the design and implementation guidelines in my latest <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner">IP Corner</a> article <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/SOHO_Servers/">Servers in Small Site Multi-homing</a>.<p class="more">This article is part of <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/01/youve-asked-for-it-series.html">You've asked for it</a> <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/search/label/You%27ve%20asked%20for%20it">series</a>.</p>
