If you've tried to use DNS view/view-list configuration commands in EEM applets, the applets failed as the EEM did not recognize DNS-specific configuration prompts (you could <a href="/2008/02/fix-bugs-in-eem-action-cli.html">work around this problem with the <strong>prompt</strong> option of the <strong>action cli</strong> command</a>). This bug was fixed in 12.4(15)T5, now you can configure DNS views from EEM.
