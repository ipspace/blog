When I was trying to <a href="/2008/05/control-plane-protection-inbound-packet/">test how the router running IOS release 12.4(15)T5 classifies inbound IP packets into various CPPr subinterfaces</a>, I wanted to use the <strong>log</strong> action in the MQC classes I've defined. This approach worked perfectly for the <em>host</em> and <em>cef-exception</em> interface (I've even seen ARP packets logged), but the packets classified as <em>transit</em> generated no log messages. While this makes perfect sense (after all, <a href="/2007/01/cef-punted-packets/">all punted packets</a> are processed by the <strong>transit</strong> <strong>service-policy</strong>), the IOS should generate a warning when you apply a <strong>policy-map</strong> with the <strong>log</strong> option as <strong>service-policy</strong> on the <strong>control-plane transit</strong> interface.
