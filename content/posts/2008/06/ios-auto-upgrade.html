I've noticed the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps8802/ps6968/ps6441/ps8258/product_data_sheet0900aecd806d1fd6.html">IOS auto-upgrade functionality</a> when the IOS software release 12.4(15)T was launched, but it was missing from the 1800 images, so I wrote a note in the "to-test" folder and forgot about it. In the meantime, the code obviously appeared in IOS images, as <a href="http://6200networks.com/2008/06/13/cisco-ios-auto-upgrade-manager/">Joe Harris managed to get the auto-ugprade from CCO to work</a>. However, the IOS documentation lacks "a few" details, while Joe's post has a step-by-step explanation.
