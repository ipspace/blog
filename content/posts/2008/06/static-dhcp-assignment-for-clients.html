<div class="bloggerBody"><p>A while ago I've installed Fedora Linux on one of my workstations and spent enormous amount of time trying to give it a static IP address from the Cisco IOS DHCP server. I though I was the only one dumb enough to have this problem, so I didnâ€™t document my solution, but then <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/09/assigning-server-ip-addresses-with-dhcp.html?showComment=1210935300000">one of the readers made a comment</a> to the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/09/assigning-server-ip-addresses-with-dhcp.html?showComment=1210935300000">Assigning server IP addresses with DHCP</a> post describing almost identical symptoms:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I have a hp2300n and I want to make a static IP assignment with DHCP. Nothing is working: hardware-address, client-identifier, no prepend, 01 prepend, 00 prepend.</blockquote>
<p>In my case, the Fedora DHCP client did not send any DHCP client-ID in the DHCPREQUEST message. One would think that the IOS DHCP server would use the MAC address as the client-ID, but that's not the case. You have to configure the <strong>hardware-address </strong>parameter in the host DHCP pool to match the MAC address of the DHCP client with the pool and the static IP address:</p>
<pre class="code">ip dhcp pool fedi<br/>   host 192.168.200.206 255.255.255.240<br/>   <span class="high">hardware-address 000f.fe83.bca9</span><br/>   dns-server 208.67.220.220 208.67.222.222</pre></div>
