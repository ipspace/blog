During my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/06/total-failure-of-blogger-poll.html">problems with Blogger poll</a>, the <a href="http://www.statcounter.com/">web site I'm using to count visitors</a> also experienced huge problems. Since I've lost only the weekend stats, I didn't even think about opening a ticket or complaining ... but <a href="http://blog.statcounter.com/?p=91">this is what I found when I've logged into their web site today</a>. One could only wish that everyone (including people that charge for their services, like my beloved ISP), would be as honest and responsive as these guys were in this particular instance.
