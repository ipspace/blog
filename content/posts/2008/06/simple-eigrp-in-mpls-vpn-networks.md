We described EIGRP-in-VRF in [MPLS and VPN Architectures, Volume II](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1587051125?ie=UTF8&tag=cisioshinandt-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1587051125). A few details have changed in the meantime; you have to configure the following features to get EIGRP running within MPLS/VPN environment:

-   The **autonomous-system** command within the VRF address family is mandatory, even if the VRF AS number matches the EIGRP process number.
-   The default BGP-to-EIGRP redistribution metric has to be configured, otherwise remote EIGRP routes will not be redistributed even though they have EIGRP metric encoded in extended BGP communities.
-   Things work best if you disable auto-summary on PE-routers.

Support for EIGRP as a PE-CE routing protocol in MPLS VPN environment has been introduced in Cisco IOS releases 12.2(15)T, 12.3, 12.0(22)S and 12.2(18)S. The basic configuration for simple VPNs having sites with a single PE-CE link is very simple:

-   EIGRP routing process is configured for the desired VRF.
-   Two-way redistribution between PE-CE EIGRP and core BGP is configured within the VRF address family.

EIGRP routes redistributed from VRF address family into VPNv4 BGP carry EIGRP-specific extended communities that transport EIGRP route attributes (metric vector, route type and AS number) across core BGP. Routes sourced by EIGRP in one site are thus redistributed as internal EIGRP routes with proper vector and composite metric into EIGRP running on other sites.

### Configuration

The VRF and EIGRP configuration on the PE-R1 router in the sample network shown in the following figure is included below.

{{<figure src="SingleHomed_EIGRP_VPN.png" caption="Lab topology">}}

{{<cc>}}PE-R1 configuration{{</cc>}}
```

 route-target import 65001:1

```

When configuring EIGRP on the PE-router, follow these rules:

-   A single global EIGRP process can be used for multiple VRFs regardless of the EIGRP AS number used in the global and VRF EIGRP processes.
-   The AS number used by the VRF EIGRP process *must* be configured with the **autonomous-system** router configuration command, otherwise the per-VRF EIGRP configuration will not be saved into NVRAM.
-   The EIGRP process number used within the **ipv4 vrf** address family is the number configured with the **autonomous-system** command, not the global process number configured with the **router eigrp** command. In the sample configuration, you have to use **redistribute eigrp 234** when redistributing from EIGRP to BGP within the *Cust* VRF.
-   EIGRP **auto-summary** should be disabled.
-   Default redistribution metric has to be specified on BGP-to-EIGRP redistribution, either with the **default-metric** or **redistribute bgp metric** router configuration command. The default metric is ignored for VPN EIGRP routes redistributed from BGP into EIGRP, but the route redistribution does not work without the default metric.

### Monitoring

Full complement of EIGRP **show** commands is available for EIGRP process running in VRF; you just need to add **vrf** ***name*** to the **show** commands. You can view the VRF EIGRP neighbors:

{{<cc>}}EIGRP neighbors in a VRF{{</cc>}}
```
PE-R1#show ip eigrp vrf Cust neighbors

```

The EIGRP topology table contains local routes as well as VPNv4 routes redistributed from BGP (indicated by the *via VPNv4 Sourced* keyword):

The local EIGRP routes appear as native EIGRP routes in the VRF IP routing table; remote EIGRP routes appear as BGP routes on the PE-router:
