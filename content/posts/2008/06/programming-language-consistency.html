I've just started to read the AXP (Linux on router module) documentation and found the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/interfaces_modules/services_modules/ax/1.0/developer/guide/axpdev.html#wp1010884">set of supported programming languages</a> somewhat intriguing. I don't like Tcl at all (and I am glad someone within Cisco finally acknowledged the existence of PERL), but if they made us jump through the hoops to get scripting capabilities on IOS, they should include it on AXP as well.
