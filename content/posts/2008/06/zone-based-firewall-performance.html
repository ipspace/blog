<div class="bloggerBody"><p>David asked me an interesting question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Can you comment on the performance differences between zone-based firewalls and the classic Content-Based Access Control (CBAC) IOS firewall? I’m running into issues where the router is running VoIP and CBAC, and call quality issues are appearing during heavy data usage.</blockquote>
<p>I never did performance tests with one or the other, but I wouldn’t expect the zone-based firewall (ZFW) performance to exceed CBAC. They use the same (or at least very similar) code, ZFW is primarily a different method of configuring the same functionality.</p>
<p>Does anyone have different experience? It looks like <a href="http://www.colinmcnamara.com/2007/10/15/zone-based-ios-firewalls">Colin McNamara disagrees with me</a>, but the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/vpndevc/ps5708/ps5710/ps1018/C78-345384-04_CiscoIntegratedFirewallSolutions.html">document with performance data I found at Cisco’s web site</a> does not list different figures for CBAC and ZFW (and they would surely make them public if the ZFW would be way better than CBAC).</p>
