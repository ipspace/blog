<div class="bloggerBody"><p>Displaying the BGP routes originated in the local AS is simple: you just filter the BGP table with a regular expression matching an empty AS path. Displaying routes originated by the local router is tougher. You could use the fact that the local routes have the weight set to 32768:</p>
<pre class="code">PE-A#<strong>show</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ip</strong><strong> </strong><strong>bgp</strong><strong> quote-</strong><strong>regexp</strong><strong> "^$" | </strong><strong>inc</strong><strong> Network|32768</strong><br/>   Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path<br/>*&gt; 10.0.1.1/32      0.0.0.0                  0         32768 i</pre><p>This would work if you don’t play with BGP weights in <strong>network </strong>statements. If you’ve changed the weights, you should filter the routes based on the BGP next-hop: locally originated routes have the next-hop 0.0.0.0 and all other routes should have a non-zero BGP next-hop. To filter BGP routes based on the next-hop you have to:</p>
<ul><li>Define an <strong>access-list </strong>that matches desired next-hop (0.0.0.0)</li>
<li>Define a <strong>route-map</strong> that uses the <strong>access-list</strong> to match IP next hop.</li>
<li>Display BGP routes matched by a <strong>route-map</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A sample configuration and <strong>show </strong>command printout is included below:</p>
<pre class="code">ip access-list standard AllZeros<br/> permit 0.0.0.0<br/>!<br/>route-map NextHopSelf permit 10<br/> match ip next-hop AllZeros<br/><br/>PE-A#<strong>show ip bgp route-map NextHopSelf | begin Network</strong><br/>   Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path<br/>*&gt; 10.0.1.1/32      0.0.0.0                  0         32768 i</pre><p>To make this command simpler to use, define an alias: <strong>alias exec </strong><strong>mybgp</strong><strong> </strong><strong>show </strong><strong>ip</strong><strong> </strong><strong>bgp</strong><strong> route-map </strong><strong>NextHopSelf</strong><strong> | begin Network</strong>.</p>
