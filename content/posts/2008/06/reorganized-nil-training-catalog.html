Our software developers have recently restructured <a href="http://www.nil.com/C1257455003A036D/html/learning_options">our training catalog</a>, resulting in a much cleaner look-and-feel in which (I hope) you'll find it easier to locate what you're looking for. The feature I like most which was sorely missing from the old catalog pages is the right sidebar telling you how to get the product and the <em>Also available</em> section listing related products. I am positive you'll also like the ability to view the descriptions of individual lab exercises (from the <em>product details</em> section of remote lab descriptions), where the right sidebar tells you which products contain this particular exercise. As always, your feedback is most welcome :)<a href="http://www.nil.com/C1257455003A036D/html/learning_options"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5208093414561403426" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_K_pkZO5-tTg/SEbdXev70iI/AAAAAAAACc4/g-M4euRndtQ/s320/LearningOptions" style="display:block; margin:10px auto; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;"/></a>
