Someone recently asked me how to get the physical location of an IP address. One of the better (free) services available on the Internet is the <a href="http://www.ip2location.com/demo.aspx">IP2Location (demo) service</a>.<p class="warn">This feature might come handy if you're trying to figure out who's attacking your application servers (when the TCP session has already been established). Denial-of-service attacks commonly use fake source IP addresses.</p>
