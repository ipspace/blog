To break this week's RIP monotony (for those that are persuaded RIP should have died long ago :), I've added another Readers' poll (and let's hope <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2008/06/total-failure-of-blogger-poll.html">Our friends @ Google don't mess it up again</a>), this time focusing on the social networking sites used by networking professionals.<br/><br/>I've <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanpepelnjak">joined LinkedIn</a> a while ago and it was a great tool to get back in touch with my friends and business partners, but it has limited features (for example, I would like to get <a href="http://www.zaplana.net/Articles/about.asp">something similar to my About page</a>). I'm also wondering whether to start experimenting with MySpace or Facebook and I want to take in account what you're using, so it will be easier to get in touch (I always hate registering at yet-another-site). So, any experience you are willing to share will be really appreciated.
