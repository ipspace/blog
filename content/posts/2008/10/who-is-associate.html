title: Who is an associate?

<p style="text-align: left">One of my readers made an interesting observation in response to my “<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2008/09/knowledge-or-recipes.html">Knowledge or recipes</a>” post: maybe network associates need recipes more than knowledge. My first reaction was to disagree; in my understanding, <strong>technicians work with recipes, engineers need to know what they’re doing and why</strong>. But then I tried to figure out what the term “networking associate” really means.<!--more--></p>
<p>Cisco’s website is not much help. Reading the definitions of “<a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/le2/le0/learning_certification_level_home.html">associate</a>” and “<a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/le2/le37/learning_certification_level_home.html">professional</a>,” I get the impression that Cisco needed three levels and had to name them somehow. In this scenario, the term “<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/associate[3]">associate</a>” is highly appropriate. However, Cisco’s CCNA and CCNP marketing descriptions compare “associate” with “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprentice">apprentice</a>” and “professional” with “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman">journeyman</a>.” I guess this makes me an Internetworking Master Craftsman. If we stick to this definition (and I understand that it would be inopportune to call someone a “Cisco Certified Networking Apprentice”), associates don’t need in-depth knowledge because “apprentices” usually are told what to do.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Cisco uses the certification structure to validate the competence of Cisco partners. The requirements for the “<a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/partners/pr11/pr8/pr51/partners_pgm_requirement_summary.html">Premier</a>” partner are one CCNA (field engineer) and one CCDA (system engineer). Would you want your systems to be handled by someone who doesn’t know what s/he’s doing? I doubt it. Therefore, my initial assumption was correct: network associates need to know why they’re doing what they’re doing.</p>
<p>If you’ve recently completed your CCNA certification, take a second look at your training courses and the exam. Did they force you to understand what you were doing, or were you just memorizing facts and recipes? <strong>Would you be confident applying that knowledge in a network-down situation as a field engineer</strong>? Please let us know your thoughts.</p>
