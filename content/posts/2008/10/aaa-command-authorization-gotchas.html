<div class="bloggerBody"><p>Once upon a time, AAA command authorization in Cisco IOS queried the TACACS+ server for every single command a user entered. Rules have changed drastically in the meantime (at least for IOS release 12.4):</p>
<ul class="Bullet1"><li>Non-privileged <strong>show</strong> commands are executed without TACACS+ authorization. Privileged <strong>show </strong>commands (<strong>show running</strong> or <strong>show archive log </strong><strong>config</strong>) are still authorized.</li>
<li>Some commands that can be executed in non-privileged (aka disable) mode (enable, disable, help, logout) are authorized only if you configure <strong>aaa</strong><strong> authorization commands 0 </strong><strong><em>methods</em></strong> regardless of the current privilege level.</li>
<li>Other commands (for example, <strong>ping</strong>) are authorized based on the current privilege level. </li>
</ul>
<p class="note" style="padding-left: 4em;">For example, if you’ve configured AAA command authorization only for privilege level 15, the <strong>ping </strong>command will be authorized if you’re working in <em>enable</em> mode, but not otherwise.</p>
<ul class="Bullet1"><li>Command authorization is not performed on console unless you’ve configured <strong>aaa</strong><strong> authorization console</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<!--more--><p>This is the sample configuration I’ve used to run the tests with IOS release 12.4(19):</p>
<pre class="code">aaa new-model<br/>!<br/>!<br/>aaa authentication login default local<br/>aaa authorization exec default group tacacs+ if-authenticated<br/>aaa authorization commands 0 default group tacacs+ none<br/>aaa authorization commands 15 default group tacacs+ none<br/>!<br/>username x password y<br/>!<br/>tacacs-server host 192.168.200.201</pre></div>
