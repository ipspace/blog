<p>I've got a simple question recently: “<i>Can I run MPLS on a VLAN interface on 7600?</i>” My initial response was “<i>Sure, why not.</i>”, as I knew we've deployed MPLS in 7600-based networks and there should be no significant difference between a routed port and a VLAN interface on a 7600 (this box treats everything as a VLAN internally).</p>
<p>It turned out the problem was "a small detail" that's not advertised in any <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns675/networking_solutions_white_paper09186a0080091fea.shtml">7600-related MPLS marketing material</a> on Cisco web site: you need Advanced IP Services software to run MPLS. To make matters worse, the only mention of 7600-series devices in the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps8802/ps5460/prod_bulletin0900aecd80281b17_ps368_Products_Bulletin.html">Cisco IOS Packaging Product Bulletin</a> I've finally found within the <i>7600 routers product literature</i> is in the first marketing slide.</p>
