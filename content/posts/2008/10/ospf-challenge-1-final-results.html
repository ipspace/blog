<div class="bloggerBody"><p>I’ve received several e-mails responding to the <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2008/10/ospf-challenge-1-establish-ospf.html">mismatched OSPF subnet challenge</a>. Some of the readers claimed that the configuration would work as-is; if you were one of them, I would advise you do some lab test the next time. A few of the respondents also noted that it was more a review question than a challenge (since I’ve been writing about this topic a few days back) and everyone who decided the configuration has to be fixed has provided the correct solution: you have to configure the Fast Ethernet as a point-to-point OSPF interface and the routers stop complaining about the OSPF subnet mask mismatch.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, someone decided to <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2008/10/ospf-challenge-1-establish-ospf.html?showComment=1224310020000">prevent everyone else from having real fun</a> figuring out the solution and posted the solution as a comment to my post almost immediately after I wrote it (but I’m positive that those readers that sent me e-mails did not read that comment first). Lesson learned: the next time I’ll disable comments in the challenges.</p>
<p class='more'>Our <a href="http://www.nil.com/C1257455003A036D/html/remote+labs">remote labs team</a> provided small awards to all readers that have sent me an e-mail with a correct solution: free access to the "<a href="http://www.nil.com/C1256F620032CACB/NILLookup/BS_IP_OSPFDV_BS">When OSPF becomes a distant vector protocol</a>" e-lesson.</div>
