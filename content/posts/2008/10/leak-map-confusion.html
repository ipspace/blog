I was wondering whether you can use the <b>leak map </b><i>only</i> for routes learned from other EIGRP neighbors? Is it also usable to filter connected routes?</blockquote>
<b>Leak-map</b> controls what its name implies: the leakage of routes received from EIGRP neighbors to other EIGRP neighbors. To filter connected prefixes redistributed into EIGRP, use the <b>route-map </b>on <b>redistribute connected </b>command. The only way I've figured out to filter announcements of directly connected networks that are part of the EIGRP process is the <b>distribute-list out </b>command.
