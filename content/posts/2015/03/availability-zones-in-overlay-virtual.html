<p>Amazon Web Services was (AFAIK) one of the first products that introduced <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html"><em>availability zones</em></a><em> </em>&ndash; islands of infrastructure that are isolated enough from each other to stop the propagation of failure or outage across their boundaries.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, multiple availability zones shouldn&#x2019;t rely on a <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/09/controller-cluster-is-single-failure.html">central controller</a> (as Amazon <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/message/67457/">found out a few years back</a>), and there are only few SDN controller vendors that are flexible enough to meet this requirement. For more details, watch the free <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/4 - Availability Zones.mp4">Availability Zones</a> video on my web site (part of <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/OverlayScale"><em>Scaling Overlay Virtual Networking</em></a> webinar).</p>
