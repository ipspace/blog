<a href="http://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/">Andrew Lerner</a>, my <a href="/2015/02/response-we-dislike-people-quoting.html">favorite Gartner blogger</a>, published a great article <a href="http://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2015/03/17/sdnot/">documenting common SDN misconceptions</a>. Not surprisingly, they're pretty much in line with what I've been ranting about for the last few years (including <a href="/2015/03/whitebox-switching-and-open-source.html">Whitebox Switching Is not SDN</a>). Enjoy!
