<p>One of my readers was trying to find interesting vendor-independent network conferences in Europe. Here are a few I could recommend, please leave your feedback and additional suggestions in the comments!<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>If you’re working in service provider environment (also if you’re a large e-commerce provider or content provider), <a href="https://www.ripe.net/ripe/meetings">RIPE</a> is the must-attend conference. RIPE is also running a series of regional meetings (not sure how good those are);</li>
<li><a href="https://www.troopers.de/troopers/">Troopers</a> is a <a href="/search?q=troopers">fantastic conference</a>, but focused more on security (they do have <a href="https://www.troopers.de/events/troopers15/322_ipv6_security_summit/">IPv6-focused days</a> and I’m running <a href="https://www.troopers.de/events/troopers15/298_software_defined_data_center/">SDN/SDDC workshops</a> during Troopers, so you can do some non-beer-focused networking as well);</li>
<li>Gabi Gerber is organizing <a href="http://www.technologysummit.ch/dc_summit_profile_en.php">boutique events in Switzerland</a> – if you’re anywhere close, make sure you’ll be at the <a href="http://www.technologysummit.ch/event_zurich5.php">SDN event</a> in a few days and at the <a href="http://www.technologysummit.ch/dc_summit_profile_en.php">Data Center day in September</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.interop.co.uk/">Interop is coming to London</a> this year;</li>
<li><a href="http://techunplugged.io/?page_id=11">Tech Unplugged</a> seems to be another interesting event;</li>
<li>There are regional IPv6 events – I’m aware of those in <a href="http://www.swissipv6council.ch/en/node/758">Switzerland</a> and <a href="http://go6.si/">Slovenia</a>;</li>
<li>In-country Network Operator Groups (NOGs) sometimes organize their own conferences. <a href="https://plnog.pl/">PLNOG</a> is huge, but unfortunately at least half of the talks – including slides – were in Polish language … and if you happen to be in Slovenia at the right time, you’re always most welcome at <a href="http://www.sinog.si/">SINOG</a> (Slovenian NOG).</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m positive I’ve missed a number of other smaller events – do leave a comment or two.</p>
