<p>The fantastic <a href="https://www.troopers.de/troopers/">Troopers 15 conference</a> is in full swing… and I’m done with the presentations ;) The last talk I had during the conference focused on automating network security. The <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/Automating Network Security Troopers 2015.pdf">slides are already online</a>; I’ll add the link to the recording when they upload the videos.</p>
