While some people [lament the lack of IPv6 business case](/2015/06/ipv6-is-here-get-used-to-it/), others are busy rolling it out -- you (RFC 2119) SHOULD check out the [Status of Swisscom's IPv6 Activities presentation](http://www.ipv6conference.ch/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/B10-Swisscom-Status_Roadmap_and_Outlook_IPv6.pdf) from recent Swiss IPv6 summit.

-   67% of their customers are dual-stacked;
-   More than 20% of all the traffic is already IPv6 (with Google sourcing 60% of IPv6 traffic);
-   They launched IPv6-only LTE mobile infrastructure;
-   With the Internet traffic doubling every 2 years, they expect the peak of IPv4 traffic in 2020, peak of CG-NAT traffic in 2021, and no more IPv4 traffic after 2024.

Obviously you could ignore all that (after all, it's just a presentation from an small European country) and [stay stuck](/2015/06/ipv6-is-here-get-used-to-it/#c7988183373485577517) at the first stage of IPv6 grief (denial).
