While some people [lament the lack of IPv6 business case](https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/06/ipv6-is-here-get-used-to-it.html), others are busy rolling it out -- you (RFC 2119) SHOULD check out the [Status of Swisscom's IPv6 Activities presentation](http://www.ipv6conference.ch/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/B10-Swisscom-Status_Roadmap_and_Outlook_IPv6.pdf) from recent Swiss IPv6 summit.

-   67% of their customers are dual-stacked;
-   More than 20% of all the traffic is already IPv6 (with Google sourcing 60% of IPv6 traffic);
