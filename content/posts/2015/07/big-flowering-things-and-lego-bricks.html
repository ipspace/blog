<p><a href="http://keepingitclassless.net/about-matt/">Matt Oswalt</a> wrote a great blog post <a href="http://keepingitclassless.net/2015/07/big-flowering-thing/">complaining about vendors launching ocean-boiling solutions instead of focused reusable components</a>, and <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/07/must-read-big-flowering-thing.html?showComment=1437168590824#c2836266398982409387">one of the comments his opinion generated</a> was along the lines of “<em>I thought one of the reasons people wanted SDN, is because they wanted to deal with The Network – think about The Network's Performance, Robustness and Services instead of dealing with 100s or 1000s of individual boxes.</em>”</p>
<p>The comment is obviously totally valid, so let me try to reiterate what Matt wrote using Lego bricks ;)<!--more--></p>
<p>If you ever played with Lego bricks (or Minecraft ;), you know you can use them to build almost anything (including <a href="https://righteousit.wordpress.com/2010/06/27/practical-visual-three-dimensional-pedagogy-for-internet-protocol-packet-header-control-fields/">TCP/IP packets</a> and a <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/10/lego-data-center.html">data center model</a>). Not surprisingly, like any good engineer Matt wants Lego bricks – reusable components that he could use to build his solutions.</p>
<p class="note">This doesn’t mean that anyone apart from the engineers working with the bricks have to understand how they work – although it helps if <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/07/why-should-i-care-about-networking.html">they grasp the basics</a>. It’s also no excuse for zillions of lame <em>network management </em>products.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s hard to get useful Lego bricks in networking land. What we usually get are pretty useless components that can only be used in one way.</p>

<p>With the advent of SDN, the situation got worse – most SDN vendors are selling you prefab solutions that <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/06/software-defined-wanwell-orchestrated.html">use proprietary protocols</a> and work only if <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/06/vertically-integrated-musings.html">all components run their software</a> - if anything, the networking is becoming even more monolithic than it has been before. It’s like getting a Lego Death Star after Lord Business glued all the bricks together – it looks awesome from the outside, but it’s impossible to use the components to build anything else.</p>

<p class="note">Oh, do I have to mention that Death Star looks <a href="http://shop.lego.com/catalog/productLargeView.jsp?modalView=true&amp;productCode=10188&amp;scene7Video=1&amp;scene7Spin=1">even cooler from the inside</a>? You can never enjoy that view if you bought a glued-together version. Yeah, I know I'm digressing ;)<p><p>Obviously the business people paying the engineers can’t understand why they should pay people playing with Lego bricks (and even send them to training to understand the next-generation bricks coming out). All they want is a great toy, and I totally support that sentiment – if all you want to do is look at the Death Star, there’s no need to get involved with the individual bricks. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the people who don’t want to know anything about the bricks usually never consider what might happen when <a href="https://youtu.be/kEHRrZrXOdQ?t=4m20s">they drop their toy</a> (or their younger sister sits on it). We all know vendors tend to promise heavens-on-earth when they’re selling their warez, and most of us have at least one gruesome tech support story to share.</p>
<p>Finally, since everyone and their dog think their business is unique, they’re usually not happy just looking at their Death Star – they want to adapt it to the uniqueness of their situation, which is a bit hard to do if you cannot change it, because you bought a pre-glued toy, and not a box of bricks.</p>
<p class="note">Before you start writing a comment about SDN applications sitting on top of SDN controllers, do me a favor and read the documentation of those controllers. Most of them are no better than routers and switches we’re dealing with today – while all of them have a REST API, it’s impossible to make them do something they were not supposed to do.</p>
