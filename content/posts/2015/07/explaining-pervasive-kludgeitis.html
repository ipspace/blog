<p>I found a <a href="http://250bpm.com/blog:49">great explanation</a> for hodgepodge of kludges found in "organically grown" solutions (legacy precursors to SD-WAN come to mind):</p>
<blockquote class="cite">In a long-lived project, components are being replaced. Nice reusable components are easy to replace and so they are. Ugly non-reusable components are pain to replace and each replacement means both a considerable risk and considerable cost. Thus, more often then not, they are not replaced. As the years go by, reusable components pass away and only the hairy ones remain. In the end the project turns into a monolithic cluster of ugly components melted one into another.</blockquote>
<p>Note: You really should <a href="http://250bpm.com/blog:49">read the whole blog post</a>.</p>
