<p>One of the topics I’m addressing in the <a href="mailto:http://www.ipspace.net/Enterprise_IPv6_-_the_First_Steps">Enterprise IPv6 101</a> webinar (after all, it’s an introductory-level webinar) is the question of “what exactly is IPv6”. After all the promises, myths, in the end <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/IPv6E101/2.1%20-%20IPv6%20101.mp4">it turns out all we got were bigger addresses</a> (and ton of additional complexity).</p>
