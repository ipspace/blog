title: Why Should I Care About Networking?
url: /2015/07/why-should-i-care-about-networking.html
---

<p>A month ago I was asked to deliver a short presentation on “something interesting about networking” at <a href="http://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en">my local university</a>. The temptation to talk about network automation and SDN was huge, but I quickly figured out that would make no sense (the audience were students in their freshman year) and decided to talk about a fundamental question: why should a programmer care about networking.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the presentation wasn’t recorded, but you can <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/Why Should I Care About Networking.pdf">browse the slide deck</a> on the <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/">ipSpace.net public content</a> web site.</p>
