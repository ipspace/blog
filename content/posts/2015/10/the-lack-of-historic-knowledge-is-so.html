title: The Lack of Historic Knowledge Is so Frustrating

<p>Every time I’m explaining the intricacies of new technologies to networking engineers, I try to use analogies with older well-known technologies, trying to make it simpler to grasp the architectural constraints of the shiny new stuff.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most engineers younger than ~35 years have no idea what I’m talking about – all they know are Ethernet, IP and MPLS.</p>
<p>Just to give you an example – here’s a slide from my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN,_OpenFlow_and_NFV_Workshop">SDN workshop</a>.<!--more--> Anyone familiar with the technologies I listed on the slide immediately grasps the limitations of various SDN approaches.</p>
<div class="separator"><a href="/2015/10/s1600-OpenFlow+-+Old+Technologies.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="/2015/10/s500-OpenFlow+-+Old+Technologies.jpg"/></a></div>
<p>How many people still remember those technologies? They are dead for a good reason, but unless we know what the reason is, we keep reinventing them after a decade or two.</p>
<p>Want a few more examples? I was trying to explain the principles of SAN and differences between FC and FCoE to a networking engineer a while ago. I started with B2B credits in FC and told him <em>Fibre Channel uses exactly the same approach as hop-by-hop windows we had in X.25, with the same results</em>… resulting in confused blank stare. Further down the conversation I said <em>FCoE uses lossless Ethernet, which uses PAUSE frames, which are exactly the same thing as Ctrl-S and Ctrl-Q on an async link. </em>Same result.</p>
<p>In short, the lack of historical knowledge I see in younger engineers is depressing, and it’s obvious when looking at many SDN ideas or even products that “<em>Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it</em>”, but I simply don’t know how to fix it – it’s so hard to motivate young people to learn about seemingly irrelevant stuff. Any ideas are highly appreciated.</p>
<p>However, there is something you can do – always ask <a href="/2008/09/knowledge-or-recipes/"><em>why </em>do we do things the way we do them</a> and <a href="/2015/03/you-must-understand-fundamentals-to-be/">understanding the fundamental principles</a> instead of focusing on the <a href="/2015/03/too-many-details-can-hurt-you-or-why/">intricacies of the configuration commands</a>. Study old technologies and try to grasp <em>why </em>we no longer use them, because RFC 1925 section 2.11 remains as relevant as ever.</p>
