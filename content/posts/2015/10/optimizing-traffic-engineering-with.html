title: Optimizing Traffic Engineering with NorthStar Controller on Software Gone Wild

<p>Content providers were using centralized traffic flow optimization together with MPLS TE for at least 15 years (some of them immediately after Cisco launched the early MPLS-TE implementation in their 12.0(5)T release), but it was always hard to push the results into the network devices.</p>
<p>PCEP and BGP-LS all changed that – they give you a standard mechanism to extract network topology and install end-to-end paths across the network, as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/julian-lucek/0/117/4b4">Julian Lucek</a> of Juniper Networks explained in <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_43-NorthStar_MPLS-TE_Controller.mp3">Episode 43</a> of Software Gone Wild.<!--more--></p>
<p>We started with easy questions like “What is the Juniper's NorthStar controller and what can it do” but as always our discussion quickly turned into a deep dive during which we covered these topics:</p>
<ul class="BulletList"><li>How does an MPLS-TE controller discover the network topology?</li>
<li>What does the controller do once it knows the network topology?</li>
<li>How does it install new MPLS-TE tunnels?</li>
<li>How does it deal with changing bandwidth requirements or changes in network topology?</li>
<li>How could it replace the messy inter-area MPLS-TE with PCEP-signaled tunnels?</li>
<li>How would you integrate the NorthStar controller with an orchestration system (or user-facing portal)?</li>
<li>What happens when the controller fails?</li>
</ul>
