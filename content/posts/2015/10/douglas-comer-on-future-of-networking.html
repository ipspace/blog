<p>Jim Small asked me what I thought about the <a href="https://packetpushers.net/podcast/weekly-show/show-255-future-networking-douglas-comer/">Future of Networking</a> Packet Pushers podcast with Douglas Comer. I decided to listen to it while driving toward one of my recent hikes, and it was a great decision– it was the best Packet Pushers podcast I listened to in a long while.<!--more--></p>
<p>Not only is professor Comer a legend, he’s also a great teacher. It was amazing how he politely stopped Greg whenever Greg wanted to start one of his usual arguments or started saddling the unicorn, and patiently explained the facts and the reasons behind the current way of doing things.</p>
<p>Finally, they simply had to touch on failed QoS attempts and the current state of SDN. Priceless.</p>
<p>Long story short: You (RFC 2119) MUST <a href="https://packetpushers.net/podcast/weekly-show/show-255-future-networking-douglas-comer/">listen to this show</a>!</p>
