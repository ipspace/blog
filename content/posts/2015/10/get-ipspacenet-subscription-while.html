<p>Reiss Romoli, the fantastic organizers of my <a href="http://www.reissromoli.it/en/training/seminars-and-event/international-seminar-2015/item/106-international-seminar-2015-con-ivan-pepelnjak-sdn-nfv-real-life-use-cases-eng.html">SDN/NFV event in Rome, Italy</a> in late October are offering you a free <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">personal ipSpace.net subscription</a> – a saving of $299 or approximately EUR 270.</p>
<p>All you have to do to qualify is (A) <a href="http://stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/RegForm_PromoIPPK.pdf">download and fill in the registration form</a>, (B) send it to Reiss Romoli and (C) pay before attending the webinar.</p>
<p class="info">Yeah, I know the PDF form says “fax it back” – everyone has to use the tools that work best in their environment. </p>
<p>Hope we'll meet in warm and sunny Rome in a few weeks!</p>
