<p>Whenever a vendor approaches me touting the benefits of their new gizmo, they want to give me a product demo, or offer me access to online labs… and I always tell them I’m not interested until I see their design and configuration guides.</p>
<p>Here’s why I think you should <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/03/response-why-technology-still-matters.html">take the same approach</a>:<!--more--></p>
<h4>Architecture first, then implementation details</h4><p>Playing with new gear is nice (and vendors know that, which explains their focus on online labs), but we should keep the end-goal in mind: is the gear useful in solving our problems?</p>
<p>To answer that question, you need to understand:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>The problem you have (which might be the hardest part)</li>
<li>What problem the vendor claims to be solving and what problem they’re actually solving (if any);</li>
<li>The architecture of the solution, and its limitations;</li>
<li>How it works;</li>
<li>And finally how easy it is to configure and operate (which might be what you would get from the demo).</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, you need to understand the architectural framework of the solution before focusing on individual bits-and-pieces.</p>
<p>Too complex? Let me rephrase. You need to start here (as boring and depressing as it may look):</p>

<p>… so that when you add the details you get this:</p>

<p>… and not this:</p>

<p>Finally, do keep in mind that a product that doesn’t have proper documentation might not be suitable for production deployment (or maybe it’s just me).</p>

<h4>Or should we look at the product first?</h4><p>Does that mean that there's no value in demos and online labs? Not really. You might want to look at a product demo to quickly decide whether to consider the product or not before spending time figuring out what it is – with so many products out there, you can afford to skip one or two just because the UI sucks.</p>
