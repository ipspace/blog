<p>Every other week I stumble upon a high-level SDN article that repeats the misleading <em>SDN is centralized control plane </em>mantra (often copied verbatim from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking">Wikipedia article on SDN</a>, sometimes forgetting to quote the source).</p>
<p>Yesterday, I had enough and decided to respond.<!--more--></p>
<p class="note">The original response is in quotes; I wrote additional explanations so I’ll be able to quote this blog post in future.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Would everyone <strong>please</strong> get the terminology right? Central controller (or centralized visibility or central policy engine) is <strong>not</strong> centralized control plane. </blockquote>
<p>Control plane in network devices (or distributed systems) is a well-defined concept that implements not only routing protocols (as is commonly understood), but also real-time protocols like spanning tree BPDU, LACP, link failure detection mechanisms like BFD and UDLD and even host-to-network protocols like ARP. More details in:</p>

<blockquote class="cite">The former makes perfect sense, particularly when combined with business-as-usual distributed forwarding to augment its behavior, the latter makes absolutely no sense in real world, no matter what its proponents claim.</blockquote>
<p>Centralized control, be it configuration or policy management, traffic engineering or exception routing (aka PBR) significantly simplifies hard-to-solve problems that benefit from centralized visibility. Controller-based networks (or orchestration systems if you prefer that terminology) have a bright future. They also have a long history – there are numerous home grown or commercial products that implemented some variant of centralized control for decades (example: Cariden MATE or service provisioning systems).</p>
<p>Centralized control plane (implementing a reasonably complete set of control-plane protocols, including host-to-network protocols and fast failure discovery) cannot scale, as every implementer of a commercial OpenFlow-based product had to admit sooner or later. Let me just list a few examples:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>NEC pushed the envelope the furthest with their ProgrammableFlow controller, but only because they decided not to implement most control-plane protocols;</li>
<li>Nicira was using OpenFlow in their Network Virtualization Platform (NVP), but <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/11/layer-2-and-layer-3-switching-in-vmware.html">deviated from it the moment they had to implement layer-3 forwarding and ARP</a>. New products from the Nicira team (Open Virtual Networking) use a combination of centralized policy and forwarding information distribution with local intelligence (on-host agent);</li>
<li>Big Switch Networks got a scalable product only when they <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/02/big-cloud-fabric-scaling-openflow-fabric.html">deviated from the pure concepts of OpenFlow and centralized control plane</a>, and implemented control-plane protocols locally;</li>
<li>HP decided to <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/05/openflow-in-hp-campus-solutions-on.html">use OpenFlow to augment traditional distributed forwarding</a>, not replace it, because (in their own words) that’s the only architecture that makes sense;</li>
<li>Even Google (in its OpenFlow-based WAN network) <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/05/openflow-google-brilliant-but-not.html">uses centralized control plane within a single WAN edge node</a> (a tightly-coupled leaf-and-spine fabric), while relying on traditional routing protocols between WAN edge nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point it’s worth noting that all traditional centralized networks (Frame Relay, SDH/SONET, even SNA) always contained some local intelligence, <em>because that’s the only approach that scales</em>.</p>
<p class="note">Please note that this argument has nothing to do with OpenFlow. Any system with centralized control plane failed to scale, starting with Ipsilon Networks and Cisco’s Multi Layer Switching. </p>
