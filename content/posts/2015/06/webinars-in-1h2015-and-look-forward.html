<p>The first half of 2015 was extremely productive – seven brand new webinars (or 22 hours of new content) were added to the ipSpace.net webinar library.</p>
<p>Most of the development focus was on SDN and network automation: <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/OpenFlow_Deep_Dive">OpenFlow</a>, <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/NETCONF_and_YANG">NETCONF and YANG</a>, <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Using_Ansible,_YAML_and_Jinja2">Ansible, Jinja and YAML</a>, and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Monitoring_Software_Defined_Networks">Monitoring SDN networks</a>. There was also the traditional <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics_Update">Data Center Fabrics Update</a> session in May, <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_Microsegmentation">IPv6 Microsegmentation</a> webinar in March, and (finally!) <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/VSphere_6_Networking_Deep_Dive">vSphere 6 Networking Deep Dive</a> in April.</p>
<p class="more">Do I have to mention that you get all of them (and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Webinars">dozens of other webinars</a>) with the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">ipSpace.net subscription</a>?<!--more--></p>
<p>The group of awesome authors creating content on ipSpace.net is also steadily growing: </p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><a href="http://www.netcraftsmen.com/about-us/team/#terrance-slattery">Terry Slattery</a> (the very first non-Cisco CCIE) was talking about network monitoring in SDN era;</li>
<li><a href="http://ipengineer.net/">David Gee</a> explained the basics of NETCONF and YANG and is already working on an advanced course;</li>
<li><a href="http://keepingitclassless.net/">Matt Oswalt</a> excited the attendees with live demos of Ansible;</li>
<li>Dinesh Dutt focused on the interesting details of Cumulus Linux.</li>
</ul>
<h4>But Wait, There’s more ;)</h4><p>We’ll try to keep the pace in the second half of 2015 (although it will be extremely hard due to the number of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN,_OpenFlow_and_NFV_Workshop">public SDN workshops</a> and other SDN events I’m running). Here are the current plans (some more realistic than others):</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Michele Chubirka will tell you how to <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ending_the_Tyranny_of_Expensive_Security_Tools">replace expensive security tools with existing monitoring systems, network devices, and open-source applications</a>;</li>
<li>There will be another Data Center Fabrics update session focused on Cisco’s ACI and EVPN;</li>
<li>The SDN curriculum will continue to grow with NFV, BGP SDN, and SDN Use Cases webinars;</li>
<li>I already have the materials for the Building Active-Active Data Centers webinar, and it might finally happen;</li>
<li>We’re planning to roll out a whole <a href="http://www.insinuator.net/2015/06/is-ipv6-more-secure-than-ipv4-or-less/">series of deep-dive IPv6 security webinars with Enno Rey and his team</a>.</li>
</ul>
