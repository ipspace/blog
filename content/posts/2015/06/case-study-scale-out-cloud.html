<p>I helped several customers design scale-out private or public cloud infrastructure. In every case, I tried to start with a reasonably small pod (based on what they’d consider <a href="http://kontrolissues.net/2015/03/27/sometimes-size-matters-im-sorry-but-youre-just-not-big-enough/">acceptable loss unit</a> – another great term I inherited from Chris Young), connected them to a shared L3 backbone (either within a data center or across multiple data centers), and then tried to address the inevitable desire for stretched layer-2 connectivity.</p>
<p>You’ll find a summary of these designs in my next <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/ExpertExpress_Case_Studies">ExpressExpress case study</a>: <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Scale-Out_Private_Cloud_Infrastructure">Scale-Out Private Cloud Infrastructure</a>, and if you need more details, I’m <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/ExpertExpress">usually available for online consulting</a>.</p>
