<p>Reinventing the wheels makes little sense. Implementing old solutions with new tools might be in the same category, but at least it shows you the power and shortcomings of the new tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/OpenFlow/3.6.3 - Case Study - VLAN-aware Bridge.mp4">Building a VLAN-aware bridge in OpenFlow</a> is thus a mandatory case study, and as you’ll see in the video from the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/OpenFlow_Deep_Dive">OpenFlow Deep Dive webinar</a>, it’s not as easy as it looks. For more details, watch the whole <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/OpenFlow_Deep_Dive">OpenFlow webinar</a> (<a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=OpenFlow">6 hours of in-depth videos</a>), which you also get by buying <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Advanced_SDN_Training">Advanced SDN Training</a> or <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">ipSpace.net subscription</a>.</p>
