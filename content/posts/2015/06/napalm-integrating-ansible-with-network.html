<p>What happens when network engineers with strong programming background and focus on open source tools have to implement network automation in a multi-vendor network? Instead of complaining or ranting about the stupidities of traditional networking vendors and CLI they write an abstraction layer that allows them to treat all their devices in the same way and immediately open-source it.<!--more--></p>
<p>What happens when <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elisaj">Elisa Jasinska</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbarrosop">David Barroso</a> (the masterminds behind this idea) want their library to be called <a href="https://github.com/spotify/napalm">NAPALM</a>? They figure out it stands for Network Automation and Programmability Abstraction Layer with Multivendor support.</p>
<p>Abstraction layers are nice, but they’re useless to most non-programmers unless you can plug them into a readily available tool, so the obvious next step was a plug-in for Ansible that allows anyone to use their tool without writing custom code.</p>
