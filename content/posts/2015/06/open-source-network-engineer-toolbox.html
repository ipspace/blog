<p><a href="http://bigwaveit.org/">Elisa Jasinska</a>, <a href="http://herdingpackets.net/about/">Bob McCouch</a> and I were scheduled to record a NetOps podcast with a major vendor, but unfortunately their technical director cancelled at the last minute. Like good network engineers, we immediately found plan B and focused on Elisa’s specialty: open-source tools.<!--more--></p>
<p>It took Elisa about 10 milliseconds to sort those tools into various categories and we were ready to start the podcast. We covered:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>SNMP tools (MRTG, Cacti, Grafana);</li>
<li>Alerting tools (Nagios);</li>
<li>Flow-processing tools (Pmacct and Kibana/ELK)</li>
<li>Configuration backup (Rancid and Oxidized)</li>
<li>Configuration management tools (Ansible and Tail-F)</li>
<li>IPAM (6connect and Dyn).</li>
</ul>
