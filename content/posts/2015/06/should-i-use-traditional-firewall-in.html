title: Should I Use a Traditional Firewall in Microsegmented Environment?

<p>One of my readers wondered whether one still needs traditional firewalls in microsegmented environments like VMware NSX.</p>
<p>As always, it depends.<!--more--></p>
<p>If your security policy requires <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/03/the-spectrum-of-firewall-statefulness.html">full stateful inspection</a> (including TCP segment reassembly) between application layers (not that <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/05/are-stateless-acls-good-enough.html">it would make much sense</a>), or application-level firewall or DPI between the web tier and the outside world, you have no other option but deploying a traditional firewall - you cannot implement either one of these requirements with <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/03/microsegmentation-in-vmware-nsx-on.html">NSX Distributed Firewall</a>, or OpenStack or AWS security groups.</p>
<p>You could implement the standalone classic firewall as a hardware appliance or deploy it in VM format – yet again, depending on what your security policy says about that. </p>
<p>I would go with a VM-based firewall between the microsegmented NSX segment and the outside world, YMMW. Alternatively, you could use <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/01/palo-alto-virtual-firewalls-on-software.html">Palo Alto firewall integrated with NSX</a>, but do keep in mind that you need a Palo Alto VM (and a separate license for it) for every ESXi host (at least within one vSphere cluster, listen to the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/01/palo-alto-virtual-firewalls-on-software.html">Episode 18</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a> for more details).</p>
<p>Finally, there’s usually a load balancer between the web tier and the outside world (or even between tiers) and load balancers tend to be pretty good firewalls when configured properly. </p>
