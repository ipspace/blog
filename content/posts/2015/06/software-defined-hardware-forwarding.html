<p>Writing OpenFlow controllers that interact with physical hardware is <a href="/2013/09/openflow-fabric-controllers-are-light/">harder than most people think</a>. Apart from developing a distributed system (which is hard in itself), you have to deal with <a href="/2013/09/openflow-and-fermi-estimates/">limitations of hardware forwarding pipelines</a>, differences in forwarding hardware, imprecise abstractions (most vendors still support <a href="/2014/05/optimizing-openflow-hardware-tables/">single OpenFlow table per switch</a>), and <a href="/2013/10/flow-table-explosion-with-openflow-10/">resulting bloated flow tables</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>Now imagine you could reprogram the hardware forwarding pipeline with OpenFlow. That’s exactly what you can do on the next-generation switches from HP. For more details listen to the <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_37-Hardware_Forwarding_Pipelines_in_HP_OpenFlow_Switches.mp3">Episode 37</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a> with <a href="http://kontrolissues.net/">Chris Young</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/craig-mills/0/8b1/935">Craig Mills</a> from HP. The podcast was recorded during Interop Las Vegas 2015, so you’ll be able to “enjoy” the background noise of the show floor.</p>
<p class="note">Note: I was wrong. Controller-initiated reprogramming of the forwarding pipeline is part of OpenFlow standard (the table description structures are read-write, not read-only as I claimed in the podcast).</p>
<p>BTW, if the topics in the podcast sound like Latin to you, and you’d really like to grok them, consider watching the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/OpenFlow_Deep_Dive">OpenFlow Deep Dive webinar</a>.</p>
