<p>Last year I claimed that <a href="/2014/10/all-you-need-are-two-top-of-rack/">you don’t need more than two switches in your data center</a> (I’ll <a href="http://www.sinog.si/sinog/sinog-2-1/agenda/">run a presentation on the same topic in a few days</a>), but focused exclusively on the networking side of the equation.</p>
<p><a href="http://virtual-red-dot.info/iwan-rahabok/">Iwan Rahabok</a> recently published a <a href="http://virtual-red-dot.info/1000-vm-per-rack-is-the-new-minimum/">great blog post describing the compute- and storage parts of it</a>. His conclusion: 1000 VM per rack is perfectly realistic.</p>
