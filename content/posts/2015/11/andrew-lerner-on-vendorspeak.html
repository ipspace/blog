<p>Andrew Lerner, my favorite Gartner analyst, recently published a <a href="http://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2015/10/19/network-vendorspeak/">hilarious blog post</a> describing what vendors mean when they say “our product is software-defined” or “we’ll make it work”. Enjoy!</p>
<p>Need more vendorspeak? Try <a href="http://etherealmind.com/poster-eight-levels-vendor-acceptance/">eight levels of vendor acceptance</a> (carefully documented during a particularly stressful on-site test in Poland).</p>
