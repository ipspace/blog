title: 'Presentation: All You Need Are Two Switches'
url: /2015/11/presentation-all-you-need-are-two.html
---

<p>I was asked to present a data-center-related talk last week and decided to focus on one of my favorite topics: because most people don’t have more than a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/08/how-big-is-big-private-cloud.html">few hundred servers</a> in their data center, they don’t <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/10/all-you-need-are-two-top-of-rack.html">need more than two switches</a> (or a <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/11/1000-vm-per-rack-is-perfectly-realistic.html">rack of servers</a>).</p>
<p class="info">Not surprisingly, an equipment reseller sitting in the room was not amused.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://video.arnes.si/portal/asset.zul%3barnesvideo=8442A3CBCEA45EF0ADB76AD5C9BAC2AEC7C2F8A570CC7EE55D3D2170BA249934?id=i18WNIYfaiGZaVipcYCVZRXc">video</a> and the <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/All%20You%20Need%20Are%20Two%20Switches.pdf">slide deck</a> are already online, but there’s a minor challenge: the whole event was in Slovenian ;) However, I plan to record the same topic in English once my SDN travels stop.</p>
<div class="jump-link"><a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/All%20You%20Need%20Are%20Two%20Switches.pdf">Watch the slide deck</a></div>
