<p>Wow, another year swooshed by. I can’t believe it’s almost gone. Maybe it’s all the travels I had throughout the year, and I MUST start with a huge THANK YOU to whoever is watching after me – there wasn’t a single major SNAFU.</p>
<p>Next, I’d like to thank the people who caused all that travel: attendees of my workshops.<!--more--> Thanks for trusting me enough to invest your time and money into attending them. You were a fantastic audience and continuously kept me on my toes by asking pointed probing questions. It’s amazing how much one learns by listening to people with various backgrounds and perspectives (honestly, that’s the only reason I’m willing to travel as much as I do).</p>
<p>However, the workshops probably wouldn’t ever happen without people who keep me going – my loyal subscribers. Thanks a million for being there and helping me work on things I love doing: creating foundational training that no vendor would ever be interested in.</p>
<p>A few people made my days throughout the year by sending me “I like your content” emails. Thank you! I can’t tell you how much a kind word helps when you’re waiting at an airport or being stuck in a hotel.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d like to thank everyone who wrote a comment, corrected my mistakes, pointed me to additional information, or offered a contrarian view. Thanks for keeping me honest!</p>
