title: Learn to Speak Your Peerâ€™s Language with ipSpace.net Webinars

<p>One of the reasons I started creating <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Webinars">ipSpace.net webinars</a> was to help networking engineers grasp the basics of adjacent technologies like virtualization and storage. Based on <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Virtualized_Networking#Happy_Campers">feedback from an attendee</a> of my Introduction to Virtual Networking webinar it works:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I am completely on the Network side of the house and understand what I need to build for Storage/Data replication, but I really never thoroughly understood why. This allowed me to have a coherent discussion with my counterparts in DB and Storage and some of the pitfalls that can occur if we try to cowboy the network design.</blockquote>
<p>Recommendation: if you have a similar problem, start with <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Virtualized_Networking">Introduction to Virtual Networking</a> and continue with <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_3.0_for_Networking_Engineers">Data Center 3.0</a> webinar.</p>
