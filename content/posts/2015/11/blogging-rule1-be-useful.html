<p>I love stumbling upon new networking-focused blogs. Many of my old friends switched to <del>the dark side</del> vendors and stopped blogging, others simply gave up, and it seems like there aren’t that many engineers that would like to start this experiment.</p>
<p>One of the obvious first questions is always “<em>what should I write about</em>” and my reply is always “<em>it doesn’t really matter – </em><strong><em>make sure it’s useful</em></strong>.”<!--more--></p>
<p>That was too easy. Let me rephrase it: <strong>make sure it’s useful to your audience </strong>(whoever the audience is).</p>
<p>The audience might be yourself in the not-so-distant future. Some people love to publish their study notes or their configuration tricks, and if someone stumbles upon them and finds them useful, you get extra karma points. </p>
<p>Just make sure everything you publish is technically correct and doesn’t contain obvious spelling/grammar errors, because your future employer might decide to check you out before hiring you, and a brain dump full of obvious gotchas doesn’t reflect well on you, does it?</p>
<p class="info">It’s also really easy to start blogging if you turn the “let’s start blogging” challenge into “let’s document what I just did because I don’t trust my long-term memory”</p>
<p>Other people try to do blatant promotion of themselves, their employers or their products. I won’t waste any more bits on them.</p>
<p>Finally, there are people trying to make an impact or send a message. I love reading those blog posts <em>as long as they adhere to rule#1</em>. Always try to answer a simple question: <em>why would someone invest their time into reading what you wrote?</em> Give them something they cherish – be it a hint, an insight, a war story, an alternate perspective, or challenge their beliefs. In short: <strong>be useful</strong>.</p>
