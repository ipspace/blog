<p>One of my readers read the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/11/beware-of-ads-that-use-inaudible-sound-to-link-your-phone-tv-tablet-and-pc/">Ars Technica article on ads communicating with other devices via ultrasound</a> and wondered whether something similar could be done for IP.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, someone already did it. A quick google search found <a href="https://www.anfractuosity.com/projects/ultrasound-networking/">this tutorial</a> which explains how to run IP stack over Gnuradio (at speeds that were last experienced with dial-up modems 30 years ago).</p>
