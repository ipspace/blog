title: Control-Plane Protocols for Overlay Virtual Networking – the Madness Continues

<p>You might remember all the fuss about <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/03/do-we-really-need-stateless-transport.html">various encapsulations</a> used in overlay virtual networking… just <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/09/nvgre-because-one-standard-just-wouldnt.html">because one wouldn’t be good enough</a> (<a href="http://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2015/10/19/network-vendorspeak/">according to Andrew Lerner</a> “we provide users with choice” actually means “we can’t decide which product to offer you”).<!--more--></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, with <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn931986.aspx">everyone converging on VXLAN</a> (because that’s what the chip/device vendors decided to support), the madness has moved to the control plane.</p>
<p>There are at least four different protocols pushed by major networking or virtualization vendors that achieve a very simple task: <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/06/is-openflow-best-tool-for-overlay.html">downloading the IP-to-MAC-to-VTEP mapping</a> into the hypervisor hosts <em>in OpenStack/KVM environment</em>:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/12/vxlan-ip-multicast-openflow-and-control.html">OpenFlow</a>, which isn’t good enough unless you implement non-standard extensions for multi-access tunnels, or combine it with OVSDB (VMware NSX, Nuage VSP, Open Daylight);</li>
<li>XMPP, because chatting between hypervisors makes perfect sense (Juniper Contrail);</li>
</ul>
<p class="info">On a more serious note, implementing the information transfer via a scalable and well-tested pub-sub protocol does make perfect sense.</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><a href="http://openvswitch.org/support/slides/OVN-Vancouver.pdf">OVN schema for OVSDB</a>, because the people who wrote Open vSwitch realized how broken (oops, functionally incomplete) OpenFlow is;</li>
<li>OpFlex (<a href="http://techfieldday.com/appearance/cisco-presents-at-tech-field-day-extra-at-onug/">details</a>) because ACI.</li>
</ul>
<p>Digging deep into the bowels of various versions of OVS Neutron plugins would reveal even more “interesting” approaches, like configuring OpenFlow flows through CLI commands.</p>
<p class="warn">Yeah, it makes perfect sense to fork an external program – hopefully through shell for improved overhead – for every flow that needs to be installed in OVS.</p>
<p>Ah, and then there are at least three ways to configure VXLAN gateways: OVSDB, EVPN/NETCONF and OpFlex.</p>
<p>Obviously it would be totally impossible to use the same protocols in proprietary solutions, so Hyper-V uses PowerShell commandlets, and VMware NSX uses whatever (documented approximately as well as all other VMware internal protocols and APIs).</p>
<p>I understand that each one of these protocols offers some functionality that’s not present in any other protocol. I also understand the need to experiment with various solutions, but I’m not willing to be <a href="https://archive.psg.com/051000.sigcomm-ivtf.pdf">the spaghetti wall</a> (<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/06/network-virtualization-and-spaghetti.html">yet again</a>), and I’m not alone – until this morass is sorted out, a lot of people won’t even touch it.</p>
