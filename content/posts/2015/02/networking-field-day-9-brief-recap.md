I'm sitting in the San Francisco airport with nothing better to do than writing blog posts, so let's see what we've seen and learned during the [Networking Field Day 9](http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd9/).

{{<note info>}}Most videos recorded during the week are [already online](http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd9/). You'll find links to them in the *Presentation Calendar* section.{{</note>}}

We've seen two **Software-Defined WAN** startups: [VeloCloud](http://techfieldday.com/appearance/velocloud-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/) and [CloudGenix](http://techfieldday.com/appearance/cloudgenix-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/). Both have interesting solutions (expect at least a few blog posts on the SDWAN topic) with some shining points and some drawbacks. If only I could get the best of both worlds in one package.

**Data center switching** is always one of the hot topics @ Networking Field Days. [Cumulus](http://techfieldday.com/appearance/cumulus-networks-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/) fascinated us with their innovative features, [NEC](http://techfieldday.com/appearance/nec-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/) demonstrated Hyper-V and VMware integration, and [Cisco](http://techfieldday.com/appearance/cisco-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/) clearly won the awards for the best-ever whiteboarded session (and [\@\_vCarly](https://twitter.com/_vCarly) shines when it comes to answering tough curveball questions). Even if you don't care about ACI, you (RFC 2119) MUST [watch those videos](http://techfieldday.com/appearance/cisco-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/).

[Pluribus Networks](http://techfieldday.com/appearance/pluribus-networks-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/) seems to have an interesting software- and API-focused approach to data center fabrics, but unfortunately we never got to the juicy details due to presentation hiccups.

[Brocade](http://techfieldday.com/appearance/brocade-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/) deserves a category of its own -- while they mentioned that they produce *stuff* that makes networks work, they were totally focused on **SDN and network automation**, which generated some fantastic discussions.

**Network management** is another must-have item on the NFD menu. [Solarwinds](http://techfieldday.com/appearance/solarwinds-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/) continued a [series of excellent presentations](http://techfieldday.com/companies/solarwinds/) -- Joel Dolisy yet again intrigued me with architectural details and path analysis discussions, and I learned about automation aspects of Network Configuration Manager that I need to investigate in more details.

Finally, [Netbeez](http://techfieldday.com/appearance/netbeez-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/) is a charming startup with an interesting probe-based product. They thoroughly engaged us, which resulted in tons of suggestions, and I'm positive we'll see at least some of them implemented in a future version of their product.

Finally, I'd like to thank the wonderful [Tech Field Day](http://techfieldday.com/about/) crew -- Stephen, Tom and Claire -- for another fantastic event. You rock!

**Disclosure**: Companies presenting @ NFD events indirectly cover the travel expenses of NFD delegates, but that never stopped me from expressing my opinions.
