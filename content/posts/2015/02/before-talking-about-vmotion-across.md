title: Before Talking about vMotion across Continents, Read This
url: /2015/02/before-talking-about-vmotion-across/

I expect to hear a lot about the ["wonderful" idea of moving running VMs 100 msec away](/2014/09/vmotion-enhancements-in-vsphere/) (across the continent) in the upcoming weeks. I would recommend you read a few of my older blog posts before considering it... and don't waste time trying to [persuade the true believers with technical arguments](/2013/04/this-is-what-makes-networking-so-complex/) -- talk with [whoever will foot the bill](/2013/09/sooner-or-later-someone-will-pay-for/) or walk away.
