<p>A few days ago I completed the last chapter in the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Design_Case_Studies"><em>Data Center Design Case Studies</em></a><em> </em>book: building disaster recovery and active-active data centers. It focuses on application behavior and business needs, not on the underlying technologies; the networking technology part tends to be way easier to solve than the oft-ignored application-level challenges.</p>
