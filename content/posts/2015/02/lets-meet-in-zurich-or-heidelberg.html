<p>I&#x2019;ll be speaking at two conferences in March: <a href="http://www.dcday.ch/event_zurich5.php">SDN event in Zurich</a> organized by fantastic <a href="https://ch.linkedin.com/pub/gabi-gerber/6/b99/28">Gabi Gerber</a>, and the best boutique security conference &ndash; <a href="https://www.troopers.de/troopers/">Troopers 15</a> in Heidelberg. If you&#x2019;ll be attending one of these events, just grab me, drag me to the nearest coffee table, and throw some interesting questions my way ;) &hellip; and if you happen to be near one of these locations, let me know and we might figure out how to meet somewhere.<!--more--></p>
<p>SDN event in Zurich promises to be great fun. Gabi managed to get some interesting vendors working on real-life SDN solutions to talk about their work, and I&#x2019;ll try to reset the overblown expectations with a &ldquo;What is SDN?&rdquo; keynote. You can probably imagine how it will look like ;)</p>
<p>Troopers is a week-long event and they always manage to keep me busy. This time I&#x2019;ll be talking about <a href="https://www.troopers.de/events/troopers15/474_ipv6_microsegmentation_done_right/">IPv6 microsegmentation</a>, running a daylong <a href="https://www.troopers.de/events/troopers15/274_automating_network_security/">Software-Defined Data Center</a> workshop, and upsetting people with my <a href="https://www.troopers.de/events/troopers15/274_automating_network_security/">ideas of automating network security</a>. Oh, and I do I have to tell you <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/03/thank-you-troopers.html">how awesome Troopers are</a>?</p>
