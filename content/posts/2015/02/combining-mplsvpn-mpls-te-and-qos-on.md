In the final part of our MPLS-focused discussion (now part of [MPLS Essentials](https://www.ipspace.net/MPLS_Essentials) webinar), Seamus wanted to know how one could [combine MPLS/VPN, MPLS-TE and QoS](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/MPLS101/9%20-%20MPLS-TE%2C%20MPLS-VPN%20and%20QoS.mp4?doccode=MPLS101) (for example, sending VoIP traffic for one customer over a different path).

**Short answer**: don't even think about doing that. The added complexity is not worth whatever extra money you'll be charging the customer (or not).
