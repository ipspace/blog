<p>“<em>Thou Shalt Have No Chokepoints</em>” is one of those simple scalability rules that are pretty hard to implement in real-life products. In the <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/2%20-%20Distributed%20Data%20Plane.mp4"><em>Distributed Data Plane</em></a> part of <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/OverlayScale"><em>Scaling Overlay Networks</em></a> webinar I listed data plane components that can be easily distributed (layer-2 and layer-3 switching), some that are harder to implement but still doable (firewalling) and a few that are close to mission-impossible (NAT and load balancing).</p>
