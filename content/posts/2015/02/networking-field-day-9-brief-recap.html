<p>I’m sitting in the San Francisco airport with nothing better to do than writing blog posts, so let’s see what we’ve seen and learned during the <a href="http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd9/">Networking Field Day 9</a>.</p>
<p class="more">Most videos recorded during the week are <a href="http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd9/">already online</a>. You’ll find links to them in the <em>Presentation Calendar </em>section.<!--more--></p>
<p>We’ve seen two <strong>Software-Defined WAN</strong> startups: <a href="http://techfieldday.com/appearance/velocloud-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/">VeloCloud</a> and <a href="http://techfieldday.com/appearance/cloudgenix-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/">CloudGenix</a>. Both have interesting solutions (expect at least a few blog posts on the SDWAN topic) with some shining points and some drawbacks. If only I could get the best of both worlds in one package.</p>
<p><strong>Data center switching</strong> is always one of the hot topics @ Networking Field Days. <a href="http://techfieldday.com/appearance/cumulus-networks-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/">Cumulus</a> fascinated us with their innovative features, <a href="http://techfieldday.com/appearance/nec-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/">NEC</a> demonstrated Hyper-V and VMware integration, and <a href="http://techfieldday.com/appearance/cisco-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/">Cisco</a> clearly won the awards for the best-ever whiteboarded session (and <a href="https://twitter.com/_vCarly">@_vCarly</a> shines when it comes to answering tough curveball questions). Even if you don’t care about ACI, you (RFC 2119) MUST <a href="http://techfieldday.com/appearance/cisco-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/">watch those videos</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://techfieldday.com/appearance/pluribus-networks-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/">Pluribus Networks</a> seems to have an interesting software- and API-focused approach to data center fabrics, but unfortunately we never got to the juicy details due to presentation hiccups.</p>
<p><a href="http://techfieldday.com/appearance/brocade-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/">Brocade</a> deserves a category of its own – while they mentioned that they produce <em>stuff </em>that makes networks work, they were totally focused on <strong>SDN and network automation</strong>, which generated some fantastic discussions.</p>
<p><strong>Network management</strong> is another must-have item on the NFD menu. <a href="http://techfieldday.com/appearance/solarwinds-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/">Solarwinds</a> continued a <a href="http://techfieldday.com/companies/solarwinds/">series of excellent presentations</a> – Joel Dolisy yet again intrigued me with architectural details and path analysis discussions, and I learned about automation aspects of Network Configuration Manager that I need to investigate in more details.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://techfieldday.com/appearance/netbeez-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/">Netbeez</a> is a charming startup with an interesting probe-based product. They thoroughly engaged us, which resulted in tons of suggestions, and I’m positive we’ll see at least some of them implemented in a future version of their product.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d like to thank the wonderful <a href="http://techfieldday.com/about/">Tech Field Day</a> crew – Stephen, Tom and Claire – for another fantastic event. You rock!</p>
<p class="more"><strong>Disclosure</strong>: Companies presenting @ NFD events indirectly cover the travel expenses of NFD delegates, but that never stopped me from expressing my opinions. <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/p/networking-tech-field-day-disclaimer.html">More…</a></p>
