<p>After almost <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/03/my-first-internet-draft-has-just-been.html">exactly three years</a> of struggles our <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jdurand-bgp-security-00">BGP Operations and Security draft</a> became <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7454">RFC 7454</a> – a cluebat (as <a href="https://plus.google.com/102486415329787631392/posts/FzPawzg86R3">Gert Doering put it</a>) you can use on your customers and peers to help them fix their BGP setup.</p>
<p>Without <a href="https://twitter.com/jeromedurand">Jerome Durand</a> this document would probably remain forever stuck in the draft phase. It’s amazing how many hurdles one has to jump over to get something published within IETF. Thanks a million Jerome, you did a fantastic job!</p>
