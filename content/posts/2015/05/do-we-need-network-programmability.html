<p>Jsicuran left this comment on my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/03/you-must-understand-fundamentals-to-be.html">You Must Understand the Fundamentals to Be Successful</a> blog post:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I just went through some Cisco webinar where they were showcasing the use of NX-OS API and Python to add a VLAN. I do some Python myself and have used that API for some simple DevOps-like uses, but for the most part if you are an enterprise and use Prime DCIM to add VLANs, why should you go through the coding process?</blockquote>
<p>It obviously depends on where you are in your IT automation journey.<!--more--></p>
<p>If you're still deploying everything by hand, and your server administrators handcraft VMs from ISO images, then DCIM is the way to go. It gives you a somewhat consistent view of your data center, and you can deploy something like a VLAN across multiple boxes without ever logging into one.</p>
<p class="note">I’ve seen environments where it takes weeks if not months to deploy a new VM because so many teams have to touch it. Don’t get me started…</p>
<p>If however your server/application people got further along on their path toward DevOps, they might start getting annoyed that they can deploy a VM in 5 seconds, but it still takes dozens of GUI clicks to get a new VLAN deployed (see also the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/01/vmware-cluster-up-and-running-in-three.html">story of my exasperation when I was forced to deal with storage GUI</a>). In those environments the need to program networking devices becomes pretty urgent.</p>
