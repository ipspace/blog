<p>When preparing for my <a href="http://www.interop.com/lasvegas/scheduler/session/simplifying-application-workload-migration-between-data-centers">Simplifying Application Workload Migration</a> workshop (coming in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/AADesign">webinar format</a> in autumn) I tried to find a solution that would allow me to recreate existing enterprise virtual network infrastructure in a cloud environment. Soon I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.ravellosystems.com/">Ravello Systems</a>, remembered hearing about them on a <a href="http://www.thecloudcast.net/2013/05/the-cloudcast-eps85-nested-clouds-and.html">CloudCast.net podcast</a>, and got in touch with them to figure out whether they could help me solve that challenge.</p>
<p>It turned you might use Ravello Systems’ solution to implement disaster recovery, but I got way more excited about the possibility to use their solution for labs or testing. To learn more about that, listen to <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_32-Cloud-Based_Labs_with_Ravello_Systems.mp3">Episode 32</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a>.</p>
