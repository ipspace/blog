With all the hype around Segment Routing we said: "let's chat about it, what could possibly go wrong". The result: [Episode 33](http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_33-Segment_Routing_101.mp3) of [Software Gone Wild](https://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild). We didn't get very far into the technical details, but you might still find the overview useful (or not -- do tell me how good or useless it is).
