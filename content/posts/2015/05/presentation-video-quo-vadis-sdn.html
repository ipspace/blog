<p>From the automation perspective, the RIPE conference is a dream come true – 30 seconds after you upload your presentation, it appears on the RIPE web site, it’s automatically updated on the podium computer, <strong>and </strong>the video recording of your talk is published before you even manage to get off the podium – so you can already <a href="https://ripe70.ripe.net/archives/video/12">watch</a> my “<a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/SDN - 4 Years Later.pdf">SDN - 4 years later (aka <em>Quo Vadis, SDN?)</em></a>” presentation if you missed it yesterday.</p>
