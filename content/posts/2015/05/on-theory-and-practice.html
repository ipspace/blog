<p>I recently read a <a href="http://ntwrk.guru/in-theory/">must-read blog post by Russ White</a> in which he argued that you need to understand both theory and practice (see also <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2008/09/knowledge-or-recipes.html">Knowledge or Recipes</a> and my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Ivan_Pepelnjak_on_Certifications">other certification rants</a>) and got a painful flashback of a discussion I had with a corner-cutting SE (fortunately he was an exception) almost two decades ago when I was teaching my Advanced OSPF course at Cisco.<!--more--></p>
<style>  .qa p { margin-left: 4em; }   .qa em { float: left; clear: left; margin-left: -4em; font-style: normal; } </style><div class="qa"><p><em>Him:</em> How many OSPF routers can you have in an area? (asked during the first morning of a 3-day course)</p>
<p><em>Me:</em> As you’ll see in these three days, OSPF is a pretty complex protocol, so there’s no right answer. It depends on the area topology, the frequency of topology changes, the type of routers… For example, areas with low-end routers have to be smaller due to their limited CPU power, for example.</p>
<p><em>Him: </em>You don’t understand. I need a simple answer that I can use in my desings.</p>
<p><em>Me: </em>How about 50?</p>
<p><em>Him: </em>And how many OSPF areas can you have on a router?</p>
<p><em>Me: </em>Obviously that depends on the area size (and all other things I already mentioned), the CPU power of the router, what other things that same router is doing, the desired convergence speed… </p>
<p><em>Him: </em>That’s too complex. I need a simpler answer.</p>
<p><em>Me: </em>Well, the official answer is three. Is that good enough for you?</p>
