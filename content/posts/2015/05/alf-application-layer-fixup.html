<p>I was talking about “<em>application-layer gateways</em>” on firewalls and NAT boxes with a fellow engineer, and we came to an interesting conclusion: in most cases they are not gateways; they don’t add any significant functionality apart for payload fixups for those broken applications that think carrying network endpoint information in application packets is a good idea (I’m looking at you, SIP and FTP). These things should thus be called Application Layer Fixups or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaydcVBdesU">ALFs</a> ;)</p>
