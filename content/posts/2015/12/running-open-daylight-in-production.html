<p>Nick Buraglio used OpenDaylight and OpenFlow-enabled switches to build a part of the <a href="http://sc15.supercomputing.org/scinet">exhibition network of a large international supercomputing conference</a> and was kind enough to talk about his real-life experience in <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_47-Open_Daylight_in_Production.mp3">Episode 47</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a>.</p>
<p>We covered:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>The basics of what he was trying to achieve;</li>
<li>How the network was SDN-based for years without anyone knowing they should call what they were doing SDN and brag about it;</li>
<li>How IPv6 and IP multicast support improved over years;</li>
<li>The role of OpenFlow-based access network in the exhibition network;</li>
<li>Multiple backup plans they had in case OpenFlow failed;</li>
<li>Why they decided to use precomputed static flows instead of a more dynamic approach;</li>
<li>How they avoided the need to handle topology changes;</li>
<li>How you turn OpenDaylight into a REST-to-OpenFlow converter;</li>
<li>How they combined OpenFlow access network with routed core network;</li>
<li>Why they selected OpenDaylight over simpler controllers like Ryu or <a href="https://github.com/REANNZ/faucet">Faucet</a> (spoiler: because they already wrote CLI for ODL);</li>
<li>Why they wanted to have CLI in their OpenFlow-based network;</li>
<li>The bugs they discovered when building the network;</li>
<li>Why you still need networking engineers (or at least someone with good understanding of networking fundamentals) to troubleshoot networks;</li>
<li>Why you should start your OpenFlow journey with a hybrid switch that has well-known high-quality traditional networking operating system;</li>
<li>Why you SHOULD pair a networking engineer with an awesome programmer to get a good SDN solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally the good news: it worked.</p>
