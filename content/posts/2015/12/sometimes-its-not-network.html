<p>Marek Majkowski published an <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-story-of-one-latency-spike/">awesome real-life story</a> on CloudFlare blog: users experienced occasional short-term sluggish performance and while everything pointed to a network problem, it turned out to be a garbage collection problem in Linux kernel.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: It might not be the network's fault.</p>
<p><strong>Also</strong>: How many people would be able to troubleshoot that problem and fix it? Technology is becoming way too complex, and I don’t think software-defined-whatever is the answer.</p>
