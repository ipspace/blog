<p>It all started with a <a href="https://twitter.com/plajjan/status/672355242751696896">tweet</a> Kristian Larsson sent me after I published my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/12/is-flow-based-forwarding-just-marketing.html">flow-based forwarding</a> blog post:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/ioshints">@ioshints</a> sure but can't OpenFlow be used to implement an LB? It feels like a mix of terms here</p>

<p>… which Colin Dixon <a href="https://twitter.com/colin_dixon/status/672503078344519681">quickly improved</a> to:</p>

Will a $1k OF switch replace your $100k carrier-grade LB? No!</p>

<p>Further into the conversation I told Kristian that OpenFlow is the wrong tool for the job, and he <a href="https://twitter.com/plajjan/status/672468838148120576">replied with</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/ioshints">@ioshints</a> that's really more of an opinion than fact. I dislike OpenFlow but I think I can argue about it in an objective fashion :)</p>

<p>It was time for the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem">I know this great proof</a> but I can’t write it in 140 characters”, so here’s the blog post.</p>
<p class="warn">BTW, if you want to argue about capabilities of OpenFlow, you <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6919">RFC 6919</a> MUST go through a facts-based deep-dive training like my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/OpenFlow_Deep_Dive">OpenFlow webinar</a> or read the specs. Gospels delivered at conferences or Open Something events will never tell you the real story.</p>
<h4>What Could OpenFlow Do?</h4><p>Let’s start with the theory. </p>
<p>You can use OpenFlow to match on any part of the packet header and select output port (or do a number of other actions) based on that match, which is good enough to implement load balancing toward anycast server farm (see <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/05/load-balancing-across-ip-subnets.html">Direct Server Return</a> blog post and video for more details).</p>
<p>OpenFlow has actions that rewrite IP addresses and port numbers, so you could implement NAT or PAT, including L4 load balancing and SNAT.</p>
<p>OpenFlow has no actions that would work beyond TCP/UDP port numbers. It’s thus impossible to implement any functionality that load balancing vendors love to call <em>application delivery controller </em>in an OpenFlow-controller switch. You can’t even insert payload into a TCP session with OpenFlow, because you can’t touch TCP sequence numbers.</p>
<p>The theoretical limit of OpenFlow 1.5 is thus what F5 calls <a href="https://devcentral.f5.com/questions/what-exactly-does-fastl4-profile-do">Fast L4 profile</a>.</p>
<h4>Reactive or Proactive?</h4><p>Keep in mind that someone (= controller) has to set up the load balancing flows. The flows could be preset based on known network topology (= proactive flow setup) or created dynamically based on actual traffic (= reactive flow setup).</p>
<p>In proactive flow setup, the controller creates the flows and stays away from the data plane. In reactive mode, the controller gets involved whenever a new flow needs to be created based on actual traffic load.</p>
<p class="info">Obviously, you don’t have to use session-based flows (that <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/11/open-vswitch-performance-revisited.html">doesn’t work well even in virtual switches</a>). You could use crude IP source+destination-based load balancing, and get the controller involved only when a different source IP address appears in the network.</p>
<h4>How realistic is all this?</h4><p>As always, there’s a <a href="http://paws.kettering.edu//~jhuggins/humor/theory.html">huge gap between theory and practice</a>. More about that tomorrow… and of course you’re invited to write your observations in the comments.</p>
<h4>Even More OpenFlow</h4><p>If you need more red-pill exposure to OpenFlow, watch the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/OpenFlow_Deep_Dive">OpenFlow Deep Dive</a> webinar, attend one of my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN,_OpenFlow_and_NFV_Workshop">SDN workshops</a> (which include all my SDN digital content), or register for the <a href="http://www.interop.com/openflow-deep-dive">OpenFlow Deep Dive session</a> I’ll run at Interop Las Vegas 2016.</p>
