<p>My first ride with Uber was a love at first sight – the amount of friction they managed to remove from using-a-taxi process is unbelievable.</p>
<p>However, every love story eventually faces real-life issues, and what really matters is how you handle them at that point.<!--more--></p>
<h4>The Story</h4><p>A while ago I wanted to use Uber for my whole family (including young kids). It turned out a child seat was mandatory for my youngest (and no, I couldn’t indicate I need it when ordering the car – I looked really hard), and the driver just happened to have one. He also told me he’d charge me extra (which makes perfect sense).</p>
<p>At the end of the ride, the child seat charge turned out to be 1/3 of a not-so-short ride, the driver wanted to have cash, and gave me no receipt for the extra charge.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to spoil the family outing with a heated discussion, but when Uber asked me how satisfied I was with the ride, I used the opportunity to ask them whether what happened to me was business-as-usual.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised when I got a polite reply from them a few days later, and totally shocked at what they decided to do – they reduced my fare to refund the difference (even though I couldn’t possibly prove I paid extra). Needless to say, I’ll use Uber whenever possible for my future taxi rides.</p>
<h4>Lessons Learned</h4><ul class="ListParagraph"><li>It makes no sense to haggle over small amounts – everyone involved would have lost way more time (and consequently money) than what they refunded me.</li>
<li>Acknowledging customer issues and fixing them takes precedence over being right.</li>
<li>Great customer support turns not-so-unhappy customer into an evangelist (this blog post probably proves the point).</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks again, Uber – I can only hope I will be able to make one of my customers this happy ;)</p>
