<p>Gartner has <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/29/sdn_enthusiasm_dives_says_gartner/">updated their networking hype cycle</a>. Not surprisingly:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Ethernet switching fabrics are on the slope of enlightenment (finally – we’ve been <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics">educating networking engineers</a> on what they really are for <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2010/07/why-is-trill-not-routing-at-layer-2.html">half a decade</a>);</li>
<li>SDN is well on its way into the trough of disillusionment (shameless plug: I guess not enough people attended <a href="http://ipspace.net/SDNWS">real-life SDN workshops</a>) and whitebox switching is <a href="http://kontrolissues.net/2015/03/27/sometimes-size-matters-im-sorry-but-youre-just-not-big-enough/">going the same way</a>;</li>
<li>SD-WAN is <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/06/software-defined-wanwell-orchestrated.html">nearing the peak</a> of <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/07/some-ridiculous-sd-wan-claims.html">inflated expectations</a>;</li>
<li>FCoE and <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/02/before-talking-about-vmotion-across.html">Long-Distance vMotion</a> will be dead before they reach the plateau.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gartner <a href="http://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2015/07/28/believesomeofthehype/">won’t give you free access to the graph</a>, but you’ll find it in <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/29/sdn_enthusiasm_dives_says_gartner/">an article published on The Register</a>.</p>
