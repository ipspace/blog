With the advent of layer-3 leaf-and-spine data center fabrics, it became (almost) possible to build [pure layer-3-only data center networks](https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/04/rearchitecting-l3-only-networks.html)... if only the networking vendors would do the very last step and make every server-to-ToR interface a layer-3 interface. Cumulus decided to do just that.

[Episode 38 of Software Gone Wild](http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_38-Redistribute_ARP_in_Cumulus_Linux.mp3) with [Dinesh Dutt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ddutt) from Cumulus is a deep dive into that functionality, covering everything from the concepts to load balancing on Linux and vSphere, routing requirements of Linux hosts, IP multicast issues, history lessons learned in the times of Mobile ARP, uRPF challenges of Cumulus Linux, and even hardware offloads being planned for Linux kernel.
