Gartner has [updated their networking hype cycle](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/29/sdn_enthusiasm_dives_says_gartner/). Not surprisingly:

-   Ethernet switching fabrics are on the slope of enlightenment (finally -- we've been [educating networking engineers](http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics) on what they really are for [half a decade](https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/07/why-is-trill-not-routing-at-layer-2.html));
-   SDN is well on its way into the trough of disillusionment (shameless plug: I guess not enough people attended [real-life SDN workshops](http://ipspace.net/SDNWS)) and whitebox switching is [going the same way](http://kontrolissues.net/2015/03/27/sometimes-size-matters-im-sorry-but-youre-just-not-big-enough/);
-   SD-WAN is [nearing the peak](https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/06/software-defined-wanwell-orchestrated.html) of [inflated expectations](http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/07/some-ridiculous-sd-wan-claims.html);
-   FCoE and [Long-Distance vMotion](https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/02/before-talking-about-vmotion-across.html) will be dead before they reach the plateau.

Gartner [won't give you free access to the graph](http://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2015/07/28/believesomeofthehype/), but you'll find it in [an article published on The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/29/sdn_enthusiasm_dives_says_gartner/).
