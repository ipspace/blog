<p>Whenever you talk to a new startup evaluating whether you’d consider including their products in your network, don’t forget to ask them a fundamental question: “<em>does your product support IPv6?</em><em>”</em></p>
<p>If they reply “<em>Nobody has ever asked for it</em>”, it’s time to turn around and run away.<!--more--></p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this recommendation.</p>
<p>First, if none of their customers asked about imminent technology like IPv6, it means that their customers are not forward-looking bunch but people who believe <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/06/software-defined-wanwell-orchestrated.html">technology problems can be solved with glitzy UIs, unicorn dust and magic</a> (see also RFC 1925 section 2.11 and <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/alberteins133991.html">this famous quote</a> <a href="#The_definition_of_insanity...">misattributed to Einstein</a>). Do you really want to be in that crowd?</p>
<p class="warn">I apologize for breaking the news to some overly innocent people, but there really is no magic and no Bandwidth Fairy.</p>
<p>There might be other excuses, usually along the lines of “<em>we know all about IPv6, but it’s not high on our priority list because whatever</em>,” in which case you might want to do a deep dive into the architecture of their solution to understand whether adding IPv6 support is a trivial task (because the architecture of the product supports multiple address families) or a total overhaul of the product (because the product architects and developers <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/08/ipv6-and-swinging-technology-pendulum.html">still live in single-protocol world</a>). </p>
<p class="info">Alain Fiocco who’s been working on IPv6 for decades made an interesting statement in a <a href="http://packetpushers.net/podcast/podcasts/pq-show-54-ipv6-adoption-trends-alain-fiocco/">Packet Pushers podcast</a>: if you include IPv6 in your product from day 1, it increases your development costs by less than 10%. If you have to reopen the hood and retrofit IPv6 into existing code, it costs way more.</p>
<p>Also, there’s no guarantee that a product you’ve decided to buy eventually gets IPv6 support regardless of what the vendor promised you when you were buying it, because the overhaul might be too expensive. Some well-known load balancing and DPI product immediately come to mind ;)</p>
<p>The only excuse I would accept is “<em>our product works with IPv6, </em><em>and we can demonstrate it, </em><em>but we’re doing no testing on that part of the code</em>”, because that shows that they do understand the multi-protocol nature of today’s Internet. However, even that is good enough only for products with software-only data plane. The moment forwarding hardware gets involved, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/12/ipv6-prefixes-longer-than-64-might-be.html">you have to be way more careful</a>.</p>
