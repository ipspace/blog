<p>35 years ago, mainframes, single-protocol networks (be it SNA or DECnet), and centralized architectures that would make hard-core SDN evangelists gloat with unbridled pride were all the rage. If you’re old enough to remember IBM SNA, you know what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>A few years later, everything changed.<!--more--></p>
<p>Local area networks (starting with cheap ARCnet and then thin-coax Ethernet), personal computers, and a bit later x86-based servers totally changed the networking landscape. All of a sudden we had to deal with half a dozen protocols and tons of unpredictable peer-to-peer traffic.</p>
<p>Most networking engineers eventually adapted and got operational experience running multiprotocol networks, and started treating peer-to-peer traffic and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">end-to-end principle</a> as business-as-usual.</p>
<p class="note">The old-timers had a really hard time adapting to the new world (it took IBM years to retrofit peer-to-peer communication using LU6.2 into their SNA protocol stack), and some of them retired before ever having to touch an Ethernet cable.</p>
<p>More recently, we’ve experienced another shift, this time in a totally different direction. All network-layer protocols but IP died, application architectures became ever more centralized (<a href="/2015/04/going-back-to-mainframes.html">cloud is nothing else but a mainframe with distributed internal architecture</a>), and end-to-end principle slowly died by <a href="/2013/04/this-is-what-makes-networking-so-complex.html">thousand cuts made by kludges</a> ranging from NAT and ALG to DPI and WAN acceleration. </p>
<p>We got to a point where people entering networking in the last 10+ years have no operational experience running multiprotocol networks, might view end-to-end principle as a security hole instead of an architectural simplification, or use network designs that <a href="/2011/12/we-just-might-need-nat66.html">rely heavily on NAT to get the job done</a>. We’ve lost approximately 20 years of progress (or whatever).</p>
<p>With this in mind, it’s no wonder we’re experiencing outright denials of the need for IPv6, and dismal IPv6 adoption in enterprise networks – a lot of people running them are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_Z3lmidmrY">in exactly the same position</a> as the SNA networking engineers were when they faced the inevitable need to deploy IP or IPX in their enterprise network.</p>
