title: Don’t Optimize the Last 5%

<p>Robin Harris <a href="http://storagemojo.com/2015/08/28/throwing-hardware-at-a-software-problem/">described an interesting problem in his latest blog post</a>: while you can reduce the storage access time from milliseconds to microseconds, the whole software stack riding on top still takes over 100 milliseconds to respond. Sometimes we’re optimizing the wrong part of the stack.</p>
<p>Any resemblance to <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/08/sdn-will-not-solve-real-life-enterprise.html">SDN in enterprises</a> or the <a href="http://h30507.www3.hp.com/t5/HP-Networking/Multivendor-or-single-vendor-for-the-network-what-s-better-for/ba-p/104661#.VeFM67QS5SU">magical cost-reduction properties</a> of multi-vendor data center fabrics is obviously purely coincidental.</p>
