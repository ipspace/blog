<p>Robin Harris <a href="http://storagemojo.com/2015/08/28/throwing-hardware-at-a-software-problem/">described an interesting problem in his latest blog post</a>: while you can reduce the storage access time from milliseconds to microseconds, the whole software stack riding on top still takes over 100 milliseconds to respond. Sometimes we&#x2019;re optimizing the wrong part of the stack.</p>
<p>Any resemblance to <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/08/sdn-will-not-solve-real-life-enterprise.html">SDN in enterprises</a> or the <a href="http://h30507.www3.hp.com/t5/HP-Networking/Multivendor-or-single-vendor-for-the-network-what-s-better-for/ba-p/104661#.VeFM67QS5SU">magical cost-reduction properties</a> of multi-vendor data center fabrics is obviously purely coincidental.</p>
