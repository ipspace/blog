<p>It’s hard to visit an IT journal web site without stumbling upon an SDN fairy tale. Here’s <a href="http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/it-networks/taking-the-enterprise-network-to-a-new-level-with-sdn/94513.fullarticle">another one</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">The idea is to cut away the manual process of setting up new firewalls, load balancers and other network appliances, and instead open the door to provisioning a new network infrastructure within a few minutes.</blockquote>
<p>And why exactly is it that you can’t do that today?<!--more--></p>
<p>How about:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Because the application developers <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/11/typical-enterprise-application.html">never specified what network services they need</a>, forcing the deployment team to waste time reverse-engineering the environment.</li>
<li>Because the application teams never <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/they-want-networking-to-be-utility-lets.html">took the ownership of network services</a>.</li>
<li>Because everyone uses a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/11/make-every-application-independent.html">single humongous firewall or load balancer</a> (well, make that two for redundancy) because we <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/12/omg-who-will-manage-all-those-virtual.html">don’t know how to manage a thousand small firewalls</a>;</li>
<li>Because the humongous firewall became the brittle holy cow that you can touch only every fifth Friday of the month at 5:05 (otherwise a crash might bring down the whole data center).</li>
</ul>
<p>While new technology might help you get the job done quicker, no amount of shining magic and unicorn dust peddled by vendor marketers will solve your problems <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/09/youve-been-doing-same-thing-for-last-20.html">until you realize it’s time to change the processes and responsibilities</a>. </p>
