<p>You might remember my blog post claiming <a href="/2013/11/we-had-sdn-in-1993-and-didnt-know-it.html">we had a system with SDN-like properties more than 20 years ago</a>. </p>
<p>It turns out SDN is older than that – Rob Faulds found an old ComputerWorld ad from 1989 promoting AT&amp;T SDN service, and it seems <a href="#v=onepage&amp;q=computerworld%20sdn%20service&amp;f=false">SDN was in operation as early as 1985</a>.</p>
