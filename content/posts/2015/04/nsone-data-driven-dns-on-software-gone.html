<p>DNS is a crucial component in modern scale-out application architectures, so when Alex Vayl and Kris Beevers from <a href="https://nsone.net/">NSONE</a> contacted me just as I was starting to work on my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/AADesign">Active-Active Data Centers</a> presentation, I was more than interested to hear what their solution can do.</p>
<p>The result: <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_29-NSONE_-_Data-Driven_DNS.mp3">Episode 29</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a> in which we discussed a number of topics including:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>The history of DNS server evolution, from simple BIND-based servers to database-based solutions;</li>
<li>How can you measure service availability without deploying agents on servers?</li>
<li>How can you get around the well-known problems of DNS-based geolocation?</li>
<li>How do you reconcile the geolocation data used by DNS with routing realities of Internet?</li>
<li>How can you use end-user browsers as monitoring agents?</li>
<li>Why are most managed DNS name servers still not using IPv6?</li>
