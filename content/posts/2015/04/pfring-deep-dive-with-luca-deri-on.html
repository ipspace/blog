<p>Whenever software switching nerds get together and start discussing the challenges of high-speed x86-based switching, someone inevitably mentions PF_RING, an open-source library that gives you blazingly fast packet processing performance on a Linux server.</p>
<p>I started recording a podcast with Luca Deri, the author of PF_RING, but we diverted into <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/04/ntopng-deep-dive-with-luca-deri-on.html">discussing ntopng</a>, Luca’s network monitoring software. We quickly fixed that and recorded another podcast – this time, <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_30-PF-RING_with_Luca_Deri.mp3">it’s all about PF_RING</a>, and we discussed these topics:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>What is the difference between PF_RING and the Linux built-in packet capturing module;</li>
<li>How can you process over 10 million packets per second <em>per CPU core</em>?</li>
<li>Do you need special device drivers for PF_RING or can you use the standard Linux NIC drivers?</li>
<li>How does a packet processing application interact with the PF_RING library?</li>
<li>How do you spread packets across multiple cores, multiple copies of monitoring application, or even multiple monitoring applications?</li>
</ul>
