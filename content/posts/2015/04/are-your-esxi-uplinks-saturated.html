<p>Iwan Rahabok sent me a link to a nice vRealize setup he put together to <a href="http://virtual-red-dot.info/is-any-of-your-esxi-vmnics-saturated/">measure maximum utilization across all uplinks of a VMware host</a>. Pretty handy when the virtualization people start deploying servers with two 10GE uplinks with all sorts of traffic haphazardly assigned to one or both of them.</p>
