An interesting message appeared on v6ops mailing list a few days ago: <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/v6ops/current/msg21803.html">the first interconnect between independent IPv6 implementations was established 20 years ago</a>. No wonder some youngsters who don't know any better <a href="https://twitter.com/linuxlizard/status/578688394823237632/photo/1">treat this venerable protocol like a modem</a> and <a href="http://community.skype.com/t5/Windows-desktop-client/Behind-the-Scenes-Adding-IPv6/m-p/1062762/highlight/true#M79906">ignore it in favor of IPv4</a> ;)
