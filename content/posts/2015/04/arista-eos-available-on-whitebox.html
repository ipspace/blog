title: Arista EOS Available on Whitebox Switches
url: /2015/04/arista-eos-available-on-whitebox.html
---

<p>A few months ago Gigamon did the right thing: they figured out that their true value lies not in the hardware boxes, but in the software running on them, and <a href="https://www.gigamon.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/gigamon-introduces-visibility-software-white-box-hardware">decided to start offering their GigaVUE-OS on whitebox switches</a>.</p>
<p>So far, Arista is the only other networking vendor that figured out it doesn't make sense to resist the tide - Arista EOS is now available on <a href="http://www.opencompute.org/projects/networking/">Open Compute Networking</a> whitebox switches.</p>
<p class="update">Update 2015-04-02: If you followed the links in this blog post, you probably figured out that it’s an April Fools’ one. However, that’s not the end of the story…<!--more--> a few hours after I published the made-up story, I started getting polite inquiries along the lines of “<em>is this an April Fools</em><em>’</em><em> joke or did you mix up the links</em><em>, because some of them don’t seem real</em><em>?</em>” To set the record straight: the story was a hoax, but almost too close to the truth. <a href="http://www.arista.com/en/company/news/press-release/1080-pr-20150331">Arista announced EOS-as-a-subscription</a> – not exactly what I wrote, but definitely a major step in an interesting direction. Finally, here’s the best part: I wrote the blog post a few days before April 1st, pushed it in the to-publish queue and forgot about it… and Arista almost made it true in the meantime. Anyway, make sure you follow all the links in the following text ;)</p>
<p>Arista always used merchant silicon in their switches to keep their hardware development costs under control, and developed a network operating system with numerous highly creative features to entice forward-looking users away from traditional networking vendors. Making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn9-pBGJgG8">Arista EOS available on third-party whitebox switches</a> is the obvious next step. Even better, you'll get the full-blown EOS, not some <a href="http://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/switching/ocx1100/"><em>cloud-optimized</em></a> version of it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Arista’s competitors plan to do the same. <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/03/whitebox-switching-follow-r-budget.html">HP is looking at becoming a system integrator</a> (and there are <a href="http://etherealmind.com/musing-hp-networking-futures-after-deals-with-aruba-h3c/">funky things going on with their H3C subsidiary</a> that is developing their advanced networking gear), and Cisco <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">firmly remains an in-house-hardware company</a>.</p>
<p class="note">For the record, here’s one of my worst predictions: four years ago I thought <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/06/speculation-first-openflow-product-from.html">we’d see NX-OS as a controller for OpenFlow switches</a> (which would be a natural next step after <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/06/what-exactly-is-nexus-1000v.html">Nexus 1000V</a>). Couldn’t be more wrong.</p>
