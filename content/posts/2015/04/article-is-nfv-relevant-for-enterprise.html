<p>Network Computing recently published my “<a href="http://www.networkcomputing.com/yes-nfv-is-important-for-the-enterprise/a/d-id/1319733">Yes, NFV Is Important For The Enterprise</a>” article. Short summary: NFV is (like BGP and MPLS) yet another technology that is considered applicable only to service provider networks but makes great sense in some enterprise contexts.</p>
<p>I’ll <a href="http://www.interop.com/lasvegas/scheduler/session/what-nfv-means-for-the-enterprise">talk about enterprise aspects of NFV at Interop Las Vegas</a>, and describe <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/NFV">some NFV technical details and typical use cases in an upcoming webinar</a>.</p>
