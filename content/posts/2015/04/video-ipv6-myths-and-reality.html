<p>I was talking and <a href="/2010/02/ipv6-myths/">writing about IPv6 myths</a> for years, but like any good myth they tend to be pretty robust. Unfortunately, as I explained in the <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/X3%20-%20IPv6%20Myths%20Reality.mp4"><em>IPv6 Myths and Reality</em></a> part of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_High_Availability_Strategies">IPv6 High Availability Strategies</a> webinar, the reality seems pretty bleak: all we got are longer addresses, <a href="/2015/03/mld-considered-harmful/">half-baked protocols</a>, <a href="/2012/04/ipv6-legends-and-myths-more-opinions/">unsolved challenges</a>, and <a href="/2015/03/too-many-details-can-hurt-you-or-why/">heaps of confusion</a>.</p>
