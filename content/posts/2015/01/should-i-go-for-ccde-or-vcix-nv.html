title: Should I Go For CCDE or VCIX-NV?

<p>I got a lengthy email from one of my readers a while ago, essentially asking a simple question: assuming I want to go return to my studies and move further than CCIE I currently hold, should I go for CCDE or the <a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=51118&amp;ui=www_cert">new VMware’s VCIX-NV</a>?</p>
<p>Well, it’s almost like “<em>do you believe in scale-up or scale-out?</em>” ;) Both approaches have their merits.<!--more--></p>
<p>Aiming for CCDE is (oversimplifying to the extreme with sincere apologies to the CCDE community) going for more of the same, obviously replacing bit-by-bit protocol knowledge and configuration gimmicks with focus on network design and architecture.</p>
<p>Aiming for VCIX-NV is entering new territory – not entirely unfamiliar, it’s still routing and switching, but different.</p>
<p>We could discuss <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/08/should-i-go-for-ccie-or-some-other.html">whether one or the other is a better career move</a> (if you want to go down that tangent, write a comment), but if you want to <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2008/11/sometimes-path-is-more-important-than.html">pursue a certification to have a structured studying path</a> (and force yourself to study – see also <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2008/12/random-scenic-route-certification.html">this post</a>), you have to decide whether you love getting better at what you do (CCDE) or try something new (VCIX-NV).</p>
