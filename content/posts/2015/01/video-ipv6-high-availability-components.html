<p>Last spring I ran an IPv6 High Availability webinar which started (not surprisingly) with a simple question: “<em>which network components affect availability in IPv6 world, and how is a dual-stack or an IPv6-only environment different from what we had in the IPv4 world?</em>”</p>
<p>This part of the webinar is now available with <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free">Free Subscription</a>. <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/IPv6HA/1.2%20-%20High%20Availability%20Components.mp4">Enjoy the video</a>, and don't forget to explore other <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6">IPv6 resources</a> on ipSpace net.</p>
