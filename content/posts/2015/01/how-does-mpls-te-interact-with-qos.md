title: How Does MPLS-TE Interact with QoS

MPLS Traffic Engineer is sometimes promoted as a QoS solution (it seems [*bandwidth calendaring*](/2012/02/bandwidth-on-demand-is-openflow-silver/) is a permanent obsession of some networking engineers, and OpenFlow is no more a solution than MPLS-TE was ;), but in reality it's pretty hard to make the two work together seamlessly (just ask anyone who had to [implement auto-bandwidth MPLS-TE in a large network](https://ripe64.ripe.net/archives/video/23/)).

Not surprisingly, we [addressed the topic](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/MPLS101/6%20-%20MPLS-TE%20and%20QoS.mp4?doccode=MPLS101) during our _MPLS Tech Talk_ (now part of [MPLS Essentials](https://www.ipspace.net/MPLS_Essentials) webinar).
