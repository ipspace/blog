title: How Does MPLS-TE Interact with QoS

<p>MPLS Traffic Engineer is sometimes promoted as a QoS solution (it seems <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/02/bandwidth-on-demand-is-openflow-silver.html"><em>bandwidth calendaring</em></a><em> </em>is a permanent obsession of some networking engineers, and OpenFlow is no more a solution than MPLS-TE was ;), but in reality itâ€™s pretty hard to make the two work together seamlessly (just ask anyone who had to <a href="https://ripe64.ripe.net/archives/video/23/">implement auto-bandwidth MPLS-TE in a large network</a>).</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, we <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/6%20-%20MPLS-TE%20QoS.mp4">addressed the topic</a> during our <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/TechTalks">MPLS Tech Talk</a>.</p>
