<p>A friend of mine sent me an interesting problem: </p>
<blockquote class="cite">I noticed recently that my IOS routers aren't sending ICMP (unreachable; frag needed) messages in response to too-big IPv4 multicast packets with DF-bit set. They're just dropping these packets silently, breaking PMTUD.</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, that’s not a bug but a FAD (Functions-as-Designed).<!--more--></p>
<p>A quick Google search found <a href="http://www.icir.org/fenner/mcast/icmp.html">this document</a> which pointed me to section 7.2 of RFC 1112 (yeah, multicast is really THAT old):</p>
<blockquote class="cite">An ICMP error message (Destination Unreachable, Time Exceeded, Parameter Problem, Source Quench, or Redirect) is never generated in response to a datagram destined to an IP host group.</blockquote>
<p>The same document also describes why RFC 1112 prohibits sending ICMP error messages in response to multicast datagrams. The processing done on ICMP error replies by the *nix socket API might block the sender socket if an error comes back from a single receiver or if TTL expires when traversing a particularly long branch of the multicast tree – not exactly a good idea in multicast environment.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> learned</strong>: </p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>You should never get ICMP error messages in response to IP multicast packets;</li>
<li><a href="/2008/01/never-ending-story-of-ip-fragmentation/">Path MTU discovery</a> doesn’t work with IP multicast;</li>
<li>Sending multicast packets with DF bit set is a bad idea unless you’re OK with some receivers never getting them;</li>
<li>ICMP echo reply to a multicast echo request is perfectly legal (because it’s not an ICMP error message).</li>
</ul>
