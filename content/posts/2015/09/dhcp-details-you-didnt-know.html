<p>If you’ve been a networking engineer (or a sysadmin) for a few years, you must be pretty familiar with DHCP and might think you know everything there is to know about this venerable protocol. So did I… until I read the <a href="http://www.fragmentationneeded.net/2015/09/just-some-quick-points-about-dhcp.html">article by Chris Marget</a> in which he answers two interesting questions:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>How does the DHCP server (or relay) send DHCP offer to the client that doesn’t have an IP address (and doesn’t respond to ARP)?</li>
<li>How does the DHCP client receive the DHCP responses if it doesn’t have an IP address?</li>
</ul>
