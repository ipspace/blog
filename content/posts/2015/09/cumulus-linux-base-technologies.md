[Dinesh Dutt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ddutt) started his part of the [Data Center Fabrics Update](http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics) webinar with "[*what is Cumulus Linux all about*](/2015/08/video-what-is-cumulus-linux-all-about.html)" and "[*what data center architectures does it support*](/2015/08/cumulus-linux-data-center-architectures.html)" and then quickly jumped into details about the [base technologies used by Cumulus Linux](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/DCFabric/M82%20-%20Cumulus%20Linux%20Base%20Technologies.mp4): MLAG and IP routing.

Not surprisingly, the MLAG part generated tons of questions, and Dinesh answered all of them, even when he had to say "We don't do that."
