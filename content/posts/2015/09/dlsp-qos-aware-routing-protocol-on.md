When I asked "*Are there any truly* *QoS-aware routing protocols out there?*" in [one of my SD-WAN posts](https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/07/routing-protocols-and-sd-wan-apples-and.html), Marcelo Spohn from [ADARA Networks](http://www.adaranetworks.com) quickly pointed out that they have one -- Dynamic Link-State Routing Protocol.

He also claimed that DLSP has no scalability concerns -- more than enough reasons to schedule an online chat, resulting in [Episode 40](http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_40-Dynamic_Link_State_Protocol_with_Adara.mp3) of [Software Gone Wild](http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild). We didn't go too deep this time, but you should get a nice overview of what DLSP is and how it works.
