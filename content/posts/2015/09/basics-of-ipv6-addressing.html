<p>Another Friday, another <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=IPv6E101">short IPv6 video</a> (didn&#x2019;t have time to create anything more substantial this week). This one describes the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/IPv6E101/2.2%20-%20IPv6%20Addressing.mp4">basics of IPv6 addressing</a> &ndash; I know most of you don&#x2019;t need it, but do forward the link to friends who are still struggling with IPv6 basics.</p>
