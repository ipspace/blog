title: How Complex Is Your Data Center?

<p>Sometimes it seems like the networking vendors try to (A) create solutions in search of problems, (B) boil the ocean, (C) solve the scalability problems of Google or Amazon instead of focusing on real-life scenarios or (D) all of the above.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanstiekes">Bryan Stiekes</a> from HP decided to do a step in the right direction: letâ€™s ask the customers how complex their data centers really are. He created a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/232V2P2">data center complexity survey</a> and promised to share the results with me (and you), so please do spend a few minutes of your time filling it in. Thank you!</p>
