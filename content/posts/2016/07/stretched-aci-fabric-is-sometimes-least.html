title: Stretched ACI Fabric Is Sometimes the Least Horrible Solution

<p>One of my readers sent me a lengthy email asking my opinion about his ideas for new data center design (yep, I pointed out <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/ExpertExpress">there’s a service for that</a> while replying to his email ;). He started with:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I have to design a DR solution for a large enterprise. They have two data centers connected via Fabric Path.</blockquote>
<p>There’s a red flag right there…<!--more--></p>
<p>While it’s definitely better to use Fabric Path (or Avaya’s SPB fabric, or Brocade’s Metro VCS Fabric) than the MLAG-over-WAN kludges, extending bridging across two data centers makes them a <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/05/layer-2-network-is-single-failure.html">single failure domain</a>, as some people <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/01/the-sad-state-of-enterprise-networking.html">found out the hard way</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Most of the applications run in a HA manner in both locations.</blockquote>
<p>I wonder why people <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/this-is-what-makes-networking-so-complex.html">still think that’s a good idea</a>. Loss of DCI link will probably just break every application running across both locations (if the application would be written correctly they wouldn’t need L2 extension anyway).</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Services run in a HA manner - one service device is active in one location and standby in the other. They communicate via Layer 2.</blockquote>
<p>Stretched firewalls <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/04/distributed-firewalls-how-badly-do-you.html">never made much sense</a>, but the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/11/stretched-firewalls-across-layer-3-dci.html">vendors are making sure the myth persists</a>. However, let’s not go there…</p>
<p>Anyway, the reader’s idea was to replace Fabric Path with ACI:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">According to Cisco and to your webinars ACI is a good candidate for a DR solution.</blockquote>
<p>I don’t remember ever saying ACI is a good candidate for a DR solution ;), but it’s definitely the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/03/cisco-aci-stretched-fabric-that.html">least horrible one</a>. In fact, any solution that replaces bridging with host routing (ACI, DFA or Cumulus Linux <em>redistribute ARP</em>) is infinitely better than stretched VLANs because it removes the uncontrolled flooding behavior that’s the root cause of many catastrophic network failures.</p>
<p>Finally, as my reader was talking about <em>disaster recovery </em>I advised him to go back and talk about the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/01/long-distance-vmotion-stretched-ha.html">real business needs</a>. Once you get into that discussion, you often realize you don’t need stretched layer-2 fabrics, because the other infrastructure (example: storage) doesn’t support fully automated recovery.</p>
