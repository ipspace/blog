<p>My friend <a href="http://packetlife.net/users/stretch/">Jeremy Stretch</a> wrote an <a href="https://github.com/digitalocean/netbox">IPAM+DCIM tool</a> for Digital Ocean and open-sourced it. As the tool was designed by networking engineers to manage data center networks (more in <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2016/jun/15/announcing-netbox/">Jeremyâ€™s blog post</a>), it might be a better fit than other tools out there. In any case, check it out and let me know how it works.</p>
