<p>Tore Anderson has been <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/IPv6-Only_Data_Centers">talking about IPv6-only data centers</a> (and running a production one) for years. We know Facebook <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/03/facebook-is-close-to-having-ipv6-only.html">decided to go down that same path</a>â€¦ but how hard would it be to start from scratch?</p>
<p>Not too hard if you want to do it, know what you're doing, and are willing to do more than buy boxes from established vendors. Donatas Abraitis <a href="http://www.hostinger.com/blog/engineering/awex-ipv6">documented one such approach</a>, and he's not working for a startup but a <a href="http://www.hostinger.com/blog/dailylife/hello-world">12-year-old company</a>. So, don't claim it's impossible ;)</p>
