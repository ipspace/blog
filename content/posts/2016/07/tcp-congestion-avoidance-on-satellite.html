<p>While some people <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2016/06/on-lossiness-of-tcp.html">spread misinformation</a> others work hard to figure out how to make TCP work on exotic links with low bandwidth and <a href="#Geostationary_unsuitable_for_low-latency_applications">one second RTT</a>.</p>
<p>Ulrich Speidel published a <a href="http://blog.apnic.net/2015/03/13/is-your-satellite-link-oscillating/">highly interesting article on APNIC blog</a> describing the challenges of satellite Internet access and the approach (<a href="http://www.rle.mit.edu/ncrc/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2011_Network_CodingMeets.pdf">network coded TCP</a>) they took to avoid them.<!--more--></p>
<h4>What did they do?</h4><p>They implemented an IP-layer coding mechanism on the layer-3 path that traversed the satellite link, effectively distributing every TCP packet across a number of transport packets (to minimize the effects of packet bursts on other TCP sessions) while also adding forward error correction to recover from reasonable packet loss rate without triggering TCP retransmissions.</p>
<p class="more">VeloCloud <a href="http://techfieldday.com/appearance/velocloud-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/">demonstrated a similar solution at Networking Field Day 9</a> (<a href="https://vimeo.com/119397229">video</a>).</p>
<h4>Couldn’t they just use QoS?</h4><p>No. Similar to <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/06/adsl-qos-basics.html">xDSL deployments</a> they didn’t control the congestion point (the satellite uplink), which probably provided just a simple FIFO queue with tail drop (see also the <a href="http://blog.apnic.net/2015/03/13/is-your-satellite-link-oscillating/#comment-34710">blog post comments</a>).</p>
<h4>Couldn’t they use intelligent shaping?</h4><p>No idea. Teclo Networks is using intelligent per-session shaping to improve TCP goodput on mobile networks (more details in <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/03/tcp-optimization-with-juho-snellman-on.html">Software Gone Wild Episode 25</a>), but I don’t know enough to judge whether their approach would work in environment with very large TCP RTT. Have to ask <a href="https://twitter.com/juhosnellman">Juho</a>…</p>
<h4>Can’t we just fix TCP?</h4><p>Maybe. While academics claim their <a href="http://web.mit.edu/remy/">machine-generated congestion control algorithms</a> increased TCP throughput by almost a factor of 2, I’m not aware of any production experience, particularly in harsh environment (mobile or satellite)… and there might be a <a href="https://paws.kettering.edu/~jhuggins/humor/theory.html">slight difference between theory and practice</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously, if I’m missing something, please write a comment. Thank you!</p>
<h4>Interested in more information?</h4><p>No, this is not my usual “<em>here be </em><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Webinars"><em>webinars</em></a>” blurb. Ulrich wrote a <a href="http://blog.apnic.net/2016/06/15/life-internet-satellite-link/">great follow-up article</a> that’s another must-read.</p>
