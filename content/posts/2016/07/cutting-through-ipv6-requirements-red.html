<p>Few years ago a bunch of engineers agreed that the customers need a comprehensive “<em>IPv6 Buyer’s Guide</em>” and thus <a href="/2012/06/choose-your-networking-equipment-with/">RIPE-554 was born</a>. There are also IPv6 certification labs, US Government IPv6 profile and other initiatives. The common problem: all these things are complex.</p>
<p>However, it’s extremely easy to get what you want as <a href="https://video.arnes.si/portal/asset.zul?id=H1paoRMKlqQZUYWKSJMP7IBf">Ron Broersma explained during his presentation at recent Slovenian IPv6 meeting</a>. All it takes is a single paragraph in the RFP saying something along these lines:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">The equipment must have the required functionality and performance <strong>in IPv6-only environment</strong>.</blockquote>
<p>Problem solved (the proof is left as an exercise for the reader… or you could cheat and watch Ron’s presentation, which you should do anyway ;).</p>
