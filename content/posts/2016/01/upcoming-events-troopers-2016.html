<p>Last autumn’s <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/09/the-autumn-cloudsdn-roadtrip.html">SDN roadtrip</a> left me totally exhausted – at the moment it’s so bad that I can’t push myself to work on non-urgent things – but there are some conferences are that so awesome that I wouldn’t skip them no matter what.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.troopers.de/troopers16/">Troopers 16</a> (March 14<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span> – 18<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span> in Heidelberg, Germany) is a must-go-to security conference. <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/05/troopers-13-must-visit-security.html">Past events</a> were <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/03/thank-you-troopers.html">fantastic</a>, and when Enno Rey asked me what I’d like to talk about this year it wasn’t hard to come up with three interesting topics:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><a href="https://www.troopers.de/events/troopers16/584_hands-on_network_automation/">Network automation workshop</a>, where we’ll spend a whole day talking about the challenges of network automation, mechanisms available to program your networking devices, and tools you can use to put together your own automation solution;</li>
<li>Automating IPv6 deployments (part of <a href="https://www.troopers.de/ipv6-security-summit/">IPv6 summit</a>) where I’ll try to answer the question my good fried Jason Edelman asked me a long time ago: considering you already have a running IPv4 network, could you automate deployment of IPv6 stack on the same devices?</li>
<li><a href="https://www.troopers.de/events/troopers16/597_real-life_software-defined_security/">Real-life Software Defined Security</a> talk at the main conference in which I’ll talk about some of the interesting security-related deployments I’ve learned about while teaching <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN,_OpenFlow_and_NFV_Workshop">SDN workshops</a> or talking with guests on <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a> podcast.</li>
</ul>
<p>The “only” thing I have to do before the conference is to develop the materials, and the tiny challenge you have to fix is to <a href="https://www.troopers.de/troopers16/registration/profile/">make sure you’re registered</a>. Hope to see you in Heidelberg!</p>
