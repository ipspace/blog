<p>I was often asked about two emerging technologies that enable standard controller-based WAN traffic engineering: BGP-LS to extract the network topology and PCEP to establish end-to-end tunnels from a controller.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I never found time to explore these emerging technologies and develop a webinar. However, after Julian Lucek from Juniper did such a great job on the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/10/optimizing-traffic-engineering-with.html">NorthStar podcast</a>, I asked him whether he would be willing to do a <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/PCEP_and_BGP-LS_Deep_Dive">deep dive technology webinar</a> on the two technologies and he graciously agreed to do it.<!--more--></p>
<p>Even better, because Julian is working for a vendor he decided that the webinar should be free, so all you have to do to attend it is to <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/PCEP_and_BGP-LS_Deep_Dive">register on this page</a>.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4><ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Don’t worry about Julian working for a vendor; the presentation will focus on technology aspects of BGP-LS and PCEP, not on specific products;</li>
<li>I you don’t know why you should care about the two technologies read <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/05/openflow-google-brilliant-but-not.html">this post</a> (and the comments) and listen to <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a> <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_43-NorthStar_MPLS-TE_Controller.mp3">Episode 43</a>.</li>
