<p>Almost exactly two years ago I ran an <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Software_Defined_Networking_(SDN)"><em>Introduction to SDN</em></a><em> </em>webinar trying to explain what SDN might be. The landscape has changed significantly in the meantime (for example, <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/01/dell-os10-and-cumulus-linux.html">software/hardware disaggregation is becoming a reality</a>), but SDN remains as meaningless as Cloud and wrapped in <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/11/the-numerous-levels-of-sdn-reality.html">many layers of marketing nonsense</a>.</p>
<p>It was clearly time to do a second version of the webinar, and itâ€™s still free thanks to my sponsor <a href="http://www.nil.com/en/solutions/sdn/">NIL Data Communications</a>. All you have to do to attend it is to <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Software_Defined_Networking_(SDN)">fill in the registration form</a>.</p>
