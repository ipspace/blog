<p>As you know I always promise my loyal subscribers at least 6 new webinars per year. Well, 2015 was a bit more fruitful. Let’s start with the easy ones:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>There was the regular <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics_Update">Data Center Fabrics update</a> webinar in May with guest speaker Dinesh Dutt from Cumulus Networks;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_Microsegmentation">IPv6 microsegmentation</a> webinar in March extended the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Roadmap/IPv6_webinars">IPv6 curriculum</a>;</li>
<li>Michele Chubirka had a great webinar on <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ending_the_Tyranny_of_Expensive_Security_Tools">open-source security tools</a> in September;</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Designing_Active-Active_and_Disaster_Recovery_Data_Centers">Designing Active-Active and Disaster Recovery Data Centers</a> completed the first phase of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Roadmap/Cloud_computing_webinars">cloud building curriculum</a> (more to come in 2016);</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I spent most of my time developing the SDN and network automation curriculum:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/OpenFlow_Deep_Dive">OpenFlow Deep Dive webinar</a> (a bit more than 5 hours of content) in January covered OpenFlow versions 1.0 through 1.4 – still more than any major vendor implemented in a shipping product;</li>
<li>Terry Slattery talked about <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Monitoring_Software_Defined_Networks">monitoring SDN networks</a> in February;</li>
<li>David Gee covered <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/NETCONF_and_YANG">NETCONF and Yang</a> in March;</li>
<li>Matt Oswalt did a great job describing <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Using_Ansible,_YAML_and_Jinja2">Ansible, YAML and Jinja2</a> in June and I extended his talk with a <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Creating_DMVPN_Configurations_with_Ansible">DMVPN-based case study</a> in August;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Network_Function_Virtualization">Network Function Virtualization</a> and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/BGP-Based_SDN_Solutions">BGP-based SDN</a> webinars in August covered topics badly-needed for the digital version of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN,_OpenFlow_and_NFV_Workshop">SDN workshop</a>;</li>
<li>Finally, the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN_Use_Cases">SDN Use Cases</a> webinar (the second session will take place in just a few days) significantly extended the number of use cases I discussed in an earlier version of the webinar in 2013 or during the SDN workshop;</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of webinars badly needed an upgrade… and they got it:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>A brand-new <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/VSphere_6_Networking_Deep_Dive">vSphere 6 Networking Deep Dive</a> webinar covers every network-related feature of vSphere 6;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Virtual_Firewalls">Virtual firewalls</a> webinar covers the new products introduced in the last 2 years as well as the vSphere morass (the only way to get a VM NIC firewall in vSphere 6 is to buy VMware NSX).</li>
</ul>
<p>All together, approximately 35 hours of new content was published on ipSpace.net in 2016 – by far the most productive year since I started delivering webinars (and the regular subscribers got it all for only $149).</p>
