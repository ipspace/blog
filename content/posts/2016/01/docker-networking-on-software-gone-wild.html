title: Docker Networking on Software Gone Wild

<p>A year and a half ago, Docker networking couldn’t span multiple hosts and used NAT with port mapping to expose container-based services to the outside world.</p>
<p class="more">Docker is the hottest Linux container solution these days. Want to know more about it? Matt Oswalt is running <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Docker">Introduction to Docker</a> webinar in a few days.</p>
<p>In August 2014 a small startup decided to change all that. Docker <a href="http://socketplane.io/blog/socketplane-excited-to-be-joining-docker-to-collaborate-with-networking-ecosystem/">bought them before they managed to get public</a>, and the rest is history.<!--more--></p>
<p>As expected, the SocketPlane team was extremely busy – it took us almost a year before all the stars aligned and we managed to record a deep dive into next-generation Docker networking.</p>
<p>The most interesting part (for me): the same team worked on an OpenDaylight-based controller solution before started SocketPlane, and decided to use a fully-distributed control plane in their next product instead of a <a href="/2014/05/does-centralized-control-plane-make.html">centralized control-plane solution</a>. Another data point supporting my claim that centralized control plane (<a href="/2015/06/centralized-control-is-not-centralized.html">as opposed to centralized control</a>) works best in <a href="/2015/11/the-numerous-levels-of-sdn-reality.html">marketing whitepapers</a>.</p>
<p>For the rest of the story, listen to <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_49-Docker_Networking.mp3">Episode 49</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a>, and make sure you stay till the very end where we started discussing running multi-realm Minecraft on a Docker swarm as well as managing a Docker cluster from a Minecraft client.</p>
