title: IPv6 Microsegmentation in Data Center Environments
url: /2016/01/ipv6-microsegmentation-in-data-center.html
---

<p>The proponents of microsegmentation solutions would love you to believe that it takes no more than somewhat-stateful packet filters sitting in front of the VMs to get rid of traditional subnets. As I explained in my IPv6 Microsegmentation talk (links below), you need more if you want to have machines from multiple security domains sitting in the same subnet – from RA guard to DHCPv6 and ND inspection.<!--more--></p>
<p>It’s also possible to solve the problem by reducing the size of layer-2 domains to what they were initially supposed to be: links between adjacent nodes (host-to-router links). Would that work in a data center environment supporting VM mobility? <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/www.ipSpace.net/nuggets/podcast/D2%20-%20IPv6%20Microsegmentation%20Data%20Centers.mp4">Watch the video</a> from the IPv6 microsegmentation webinar to find out.</p>
<h4>More information</h4><p>It looks like I’m the only one talking about IPv6 microsegmentation – all the top hits on Google are links to one or another version of my presentation:</p>

<p>There’s another CliffsNotes version of my webinar floating around the Internet, but as the author took great care to mention me only in passing without including any links whatsoever, I won’t link to his version either. Happy hunting.</p>
