title: OpenSwitch Deep Dive on Software Gone Wild

<p>A while ago I watched a <a href="http://techfieldday.com/appearance/openswitch-presents-tech-field-day-extra-onug/">Networking Field Day Extra video</a> in which Chris Young and Michael Zayats talked about HP’s open source initiative – they decided to build yet another open networking operating system.</p>
<p>Obviously I wanted to know more, reached out to Chris, and we quickly managed to set up an online chat resulting in <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_48-Open_Switch.mp3">Episode 48</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a> podcast.<!--more--></p>
<p>We started with a simple question: “<em>Why do we need yet another open networking operating system</em>” and after discussing the benefits of single-file configuration versus spread-out configuration files typically used in Linux environments quickly dived deep into the details of centralized state database used in OpenSwitch, its advantages over message passing mechanisms (nobody mentioned OpenStack ;), and the beauty of notifications provided by OVSDB.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, we had to touch on the code maintenance process, the governance, and the ways someone could join the project, and concluded with another set of dirty details: how can you claim your software is open-source if it’s programming ASICs through a proprietary vendor SDK? Hint: HP(E) managed to make an interesting deal with Broadcom.</p>
