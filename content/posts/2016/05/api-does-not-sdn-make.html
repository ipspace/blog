<p>Vendors that <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/02/cli-or-api-wait-do-you-really-have-to.html">slapped API on top of their CLI</a> are quick to claim that they SDN-enabled their boxes.</p>
<p>Not so fast. As I <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/2.4%20-%20SDN%20API.mp4">explained</a> in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN101">SDN 101 webinar</a>, programmable access to network devices is nice (less so when you're forced to use a vendor-specific API), but it's not SDN.</p>
