Vendors that [slapped API on top of their CLI](http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/02/cli-or-api-wait-do-you-really-have-to.html) are quick to claim that they SDN-enabled their boxes.

Not so fast. As I [explained](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/SDN101/2.4%20-%20SDN%20%3D%20API.mp4?doccode=SDN101) in [SDN 101 webinar](http://www.ipspace.net/SDN101), programmable access to network devices is nice (less so when you\'re forced to use a vendor-specific API), but it\'s not SDN.
