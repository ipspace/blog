<p>The <em>Model-driven Networking</em> seems to be another buzzword riding on top of the SDN wave. What exactly is it, how is it supposed to work, will it be really vendor-independent, and has anyone implemented it? I tried to get some answers to these questions from Jeff Tantsura, chair of IETF Routing Area Working Group, in <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_55-Model-Driven_Networking.mp3">Episode 55</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>I also did a bit of research after the podcast to figure out whether individual vendors support IETF or OpenConfig YANG models. Here's what I found:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Cisco IOS XR release 6.0 <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/ncs5000/DataModels/b-Datamodels-cg-ncs5000.html">supports gRPC and OpenConfig BGP and and OpenConfig Route Policy models</a>. Private IOS XR data models are <a href="https://github.com/YangModels/yang/tree/master/vendor/cisco/xr">published on GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>You might also want to check out Ciscoâ€™s <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/ydk-developer-guide-4.20.2016/docs_expanded/">Yang Development Kit</a>.</li>
<li>Juniper <a href="https://vimeo.com/139447948">published a video claiming Junos supports OpenConfig</a> and <a href="https://forums.juniper.net/t5/Automation-Programmability/Towards-the-path-to-Network-Innovation-part-2-of-the-YANG-blog/ba-p/281087">someone wrote a blog post describing how it works in September 2015</a>, but it seems that functionality will ship in Junos 16.1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have I missed anything? Please write a comment!</p>
