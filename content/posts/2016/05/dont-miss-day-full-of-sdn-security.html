<p>Gabi Gerber (with a bit of help from my side) is organizing another set of SDN events in Zurich (Switzerland) in early June.</p>
<p>In the <strong>morning of June 7</strong><span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;"><strong>th</strong></span> we’ll talk about <a href="http://www.digs.ch/de/digs-special-interest-group-sdn/">software-defined security</a>:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>I’ll quickly walk you through various solutions – from things that run in production to those that better stay in PowerPoint;</li>
<li>Sergei Gotchev from Juniper will talk about data center automation and their SDN/security solutions;</li>
<li>After the break we’ll spend at least 2 hours talking about your challenges… and anything goes as long as it’s loosely related to SDN and security – from “<em>should I use NSX or ACI for microsegmentation?</em>” and “<em>does service insertion make sense?</em>” to “<em>how do I roll this out in my organization?</em>”</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>afternoon of June 7</strong><span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;"><strong>th</strong></span> is focused on <a href="http://www.digs.ch/de/digs-special-event/">microsegmentation and NSX</a>:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>I’ll start with a quick introduction to what microsegmentation is, whether it makes sense, and what its benefits and drawbacks are;</li>
<li>Mitja Robas, a good friend of mine and an awesome networking architect, will talk about his NSX implementation experience (he has NSX running in a production deployment). There’s an interesting story around how that deployment started, and you might hear it if you’ll stay for the after-event apero;</li>
<li>Thomas Wacker from UBS will talk about reducing data center complexity;</li>
<li>Finally, Christof Jungo will focus on a topic many vendors don’t really want to see mentioned: how do you secure an SDN network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interested? Hurry up and register, the number of seats is limited. You’ll find the links to registration forms at the bottom of <a href="http://www.digs.ch/de/digs-special-interest-group-sdn/">SDN event page</a> and <a href="http://www.digs.ch/de/digs-special-event/">NSX event page</a>.</p>
