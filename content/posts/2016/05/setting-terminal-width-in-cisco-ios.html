<p>This must be old news to most of you (I managed to stay away from CLI for way too long), but I was pleasantly surprised that you can set terminal width (not just length) in Cisco IOS.<!--more--></p>
<p>You probably know the frustrating feeling where Cisco IOS starts truncating the lines you type (replacing the rest of the input with $ sign) because they wouldn’t fit on VT100 screen:</p>
<pre class="code">Client(config-router-af)#<strong>network 192.168.11.0 route-map Static2BGP</strong><br/>Client(config-router-af)#<strong>network 192.168.12.1 mask 255.255.255.255 route-map S</strong><span class="high"><strong>$</strong></span></pre><p>However, in a moment of inspiration (it helps to have a great view when playing with VIRL) I decided to try to set the terminal width:</p>
<pre class="code">Client(config-router-af)#do term width 150</pre><p>Surprise, surprise: it worked perfectly ;)) – I could edit longer lines without the truncation hassle.</p>
