<p>Occasionally I get feedback that makes me say “it’s worth doing the webinars ;)”. Here’s one I got after the layer-2 session of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Designs">Leaf-and-Spine Fabric Designs</a> webinar:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I work at a higher level of the stack, so it was a real eye opener especially with so much opinionated "myths" on the web that haven't been critically challenged such as [the usefulness of] STP.</blockquote>
<p>There’s more feedback on <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Architectures#Happy_Campers">this web page</a> where you can also buy the webinar recording (or register for the next session of the webinar once they are scheduled).</p>
