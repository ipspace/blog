<p>I’m presenting at two Data Center Interest Group Switzerland events organized by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabigerber">Gabi Gerber</a> in Zurich in early June:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>In the morning of June 7<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span> we’ll talk about <a href="http://www.digs.ch/de/digs-special-interest-group-sdn/">software-defined security</a>, data center automation and open networking;</li>
<li>In the afternoon of the same day (so you can easily attend both events) we’ll talk about <a href="http://www.digs.ch/de/digs-special-event/">VMware NSX microsegmentation</a> and real-life implementations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope to see you in Zurich in a bit more than a month!</p>
