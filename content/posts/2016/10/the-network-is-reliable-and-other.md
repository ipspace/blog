Here's some mandatory reading in case you still believe redundant networking infrastructure cannot fail:

-   [The network is reliable](https://aphyr.com/posts/288-the-network-is-reliable) -- a fantastic collection of real-life failures, including all sorts of split-brain scenarios caused by hare-brained schemes to [stretch a cluster](https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/06/stretched-clusters-almost-as-good-as.html) just a bit too far;
-   More stuff on [impacts of network partitions](https://aphyr.com/posts/281-call-me-maybe-carly-rae-jepsen-and-the-perils-of-network-partitions) from the same author;
-   [Notes on Distributed Systems for Young Bloods](https://www.somethingsimilar.com/2013/01/14/notes-on-distributed-systems-for-young-bloods/). A must-read for anyone who thinks that ignoring 40 years of hard-learned lessons and controlling a distributed system from a central controller makes perfect sense. Not that it would ever help.

Finally, If you\'re serious about deep-diving into distributed systems, here\'s the [list of materials to master](https://dancres.github.io/Pages/) (thanks to [Yuriy Babenko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/babenkoyuriy)).
