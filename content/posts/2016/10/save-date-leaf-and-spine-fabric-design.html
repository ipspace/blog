<p>Do you believe in vendor-supplied black box (regardless of whether you call it ACI or SDDC) or in building your own data center fabric using solid design principles?</p>
<p>It should be an easy choice if believe a business should control its own destiny instead of being pulled around by vendor marketing (to paraphrase <a href="/2016/09/whitebox-switching-at-linkedin-with/">Russ White</a>)<!--more-->, and if you’re looking for some solid design principles, you simply can’t miss the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Designing_Leaf-and-Spine_Fabrics_Workshop">Leaf-and-Spine Fabric Design workshop</a> on November 24<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span> in Zurich, Switzerland (<a href="http://www.digs.ch/digs-workshop-digs-workshop_designing_leaf-and-spine_fabrics/">register here</a>).</p>
<p>Designing your own data center fabric is great; rolling it out automatically is even better. Network programmability is playing a big part in the automatic roll-out process – if you want to know more, join the <a href="http://digs.ch/digs-special-interest-group-sdn/">4<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span> DIGS Next-Gen Infrastructure</a> event in the afternoon of November 24<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span> (also in Zurich).</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to meeting you in person in a bit more than a month!</p>
