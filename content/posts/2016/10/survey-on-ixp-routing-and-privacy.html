<a name="_GoBack"></a><p><a href="https://mcanini.github.io/">Marco Canini</a> from UC Louvain is working on an <a href="http://six-pack.bitbucket.org/">IXP research project</a> focused on bringing privacy guarantees into Internet routing context. They’re trying to understand the privacy considerations of network operators and have <a href="http://goo.gl/1e7cDG">created a short survey</a> to gather the initial data. </p>
<p>Researchers from UC Louvain have been involved in tons of really useful projects including BGP PIC, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/01/loop-free-alternate-ospf-meets-eigrp.html">LFA</a>, MP-TCP, <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/11/fibbing-ospf-based-traffic-engineering.html">Fibbing</a>, <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/10/software-defined-ixp-with-laurent.html">Software-defined IXP</a> and <a href="http://inl.info.ucl.ac.be/publications/revisiting-flow-based-load-balancing-stateless-path-selection-data-center-networks">flow-based load balancing</a>, so if you’re connected to an IXP, please take your time and <a href="http://goo.gl/1e7cDG">fill in the survey</a>.</p>
