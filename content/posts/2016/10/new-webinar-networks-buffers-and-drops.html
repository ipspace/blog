<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>Do you need large buffers in data center switches or not? If you’re a vendor your take obviously depends on whether you <a href="http://www.arista.com/assets/data/pdf/Whitepapers/BigDataBigBuffers-WP.pdf">have them</a> or <a href="http://miercom.com/pdf/reports/20160210.pdf">not</a>, and then there are people saying “<a href="http://packetpushers.net/aristas-big-buffer-b-s/">it’s bullshit</a>” (mostly agree) and “<a href="http://packetpushers.net/rethinking-big-buffers/">look, I have a shinier toy</a>” (get lost).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s really hard to get someone who would know what he’s talking about, and be relatively unbiased.<!--more--> <a href="https://cumulusnetworks.com/blog/author/jr-rivers/">JR Rivers</a> probably fits the bill – he spent decades with Ethernet hardware, and (working for a software-only company) has no axe to grind.</p>
<p>He was kind enough to agree to do a <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Networks,_Buffers,_and_Drops">short webinar on data center switching, buffers and drops</a>… and decided to do it for free. All you have to do is to register (ASAP – the number of seats is limited).</p>
