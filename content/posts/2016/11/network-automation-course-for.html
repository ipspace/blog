<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>One of my readers wondered whether it makes sense to attend my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solution</a> course even if they plan to deploy a $Vendor platform.</p>
<p>It depends, this time on how fast and how far you want to proceed with network automation.<!--more--> You could rely exclusively on a vendor-supplied platform, or build your own components when:</p>
<ul><li>You need a multi-vendor solution;</li>
<li>You need functionality beyond what the $vendor provides;</li>
<li>You have to do simple things that the $Vendor product cannot do;</li>
<li>The humongous $Vendor platform is an overkill or way to expensive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also keep in mind that if you're buying a fixed functionality product you're limited to what it can do, if you're buying a platform (example: Cisco NSO) you'll have to do loads of customizations anyway.</p>
<p>If any of the above applies to your situation, then you might benefit from my Network Automation Online Course – <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">register now</a>.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to spending some quality automation time with you in January 2017!<br/></p>
