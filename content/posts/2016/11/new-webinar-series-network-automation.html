title: 'New Webinar Series: Network Automation Use Cases'

---

<p>In June 2016 I got an interesting idea: let’s create a webinar series with numerous guest speakers that would describe several widely-used network automation use cases.</p>
<p>It took me almost half a year to get there, but finally the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Network_Automation_Use_Cases">first session is scheduled for November 22<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">nd</span></a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>David Barroso, the guest speaker in the first session, will talk about the importance of abstracting complex network configurations into simple data models, and illustrate that concept with a real-life fabric deployment.</p>
<p>In the same session, I’ll talk about automated IPv6 deployments: taking existing IPv4 network and adding dual-stack functionality.</p>
<p>Future sessions will cover data center fabric deployments, monitoring network traffic and responding to traffic shifts, and automating network security.</p>
