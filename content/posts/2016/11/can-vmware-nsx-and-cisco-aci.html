<p>I got a long list of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/VXLAN_Technical_Deep_Dive">VXLAN-related</a> questions from one of my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">subscribers</a>. It started with an easy one:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Does Cisco ACI use VXLAN inside the fabric or is something else used instead of VXLAN?</blockquote>
<p>ACI uses VXLAN but not in a way that would be (AFAIK) interoperable with any non-Cisco product. While they do use some proprietary tagging bits, the real challenge is the control plane.<!--more--></p>
<p class="note">In APIC release 2.0 <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/white-paper-c11-736899.html">you can run EVPN (a standard control plane) from an ACI fabric to a Nexus 7000 or ASR 1000 router</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">NSX does use VXLAN but has features beyond ACI such as load balancers and firewalls.</blockquote>
<p>Firewalls - yes, including distributed ones. Load balancers - yes, Edge Services Router can also work as a load balancer. Distributed load balancers? Works best in PPT; it's an awfully hard task to solve.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I understand VXLAN is a standards based protocol and NSX and ACI are vendor terms but how do they inter-relate?</blockquote>
<p>VXLAN is just a data-plane protocol (like IP or Ethernet). The problem is the control plane - how do you figure out where everyone is (think OSPF or BGP). I think the intersection of NSX and ACI control plane protocols is still zero.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I heard recently in a VMware session saying you could use NSX with ACI and I scratched my head and thought why you would do this, what would this provide over the added support burden?</blockquote>
<p>Sure you can. You build an ACI fabric to provide IP transport and run NSX on top of it ;) A bit expensive if you ask me ;))</p>
<p>However, I know production deployments running VMware NSX on top of Nexus 9000 switches using EVPN control plane. <a href="http://nextgendc.ipspace.net/Public:6-Putting_It_All_Together#Guest_Speaker">Mitja Robas talked about his experiences</a> with one of those deployments in the last session of Autumn 2016 <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">Building Next-Generation Data Centers online course</a> (and of course youâ€™ll get access to the <a href="http://nextgendc.ipspace.net/Public:6-Putting_It_All_Together#Recording_of_the_Autumn_2016_session">recording of his presentation</a> if you <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center#register">register for the Spring 2017 session</a>).</p>
