<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>A few weeks ago Matt Oswalt wrote an <a href="https://keepingitclassless.net/2016/10/principles-of-automation/">interesting blog post on principles of automation</a>, and we quickly agreed it’s a nice starting point for a podcast episode. </p>
<p>In the meantime Matt moved to <a href="https://stackstorm.com/">StackStorm</a> team so that became the second focus of our chat… and then we figured out it would be great to bring in Matt Stone (the hero of <a href="/2014/10/cumulus-linux-in-real-life-on-software/">Episode 13</a>).<!--more--></p>
<p>Of course we started with the principles of automations, couldn’t resist mentioning the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0988262509/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cisioshinandt-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0988262509&amp;linkId=6453da13705f6ed17240d693bf469cb5">Phoenix Project</a> and then began to explore StackStorm:</p>
<ul class="BulletList"><li>What is it and why would I use it?</li>
<li>What are StackStorm sensors and actions, and how can you write one... which brought us to concept of StackStorm packs</li>
<li>StackStorm installation complexity and what the development team is doing to make it more manageable</li>
<li>How simple (or not) it is to write a StackStorm pack</li>
<li>Who uses StackStorm and why?</li>
<li>What can you do with StackStorm in networking today?</li>
<li>What's the difference between StackStorm and Brocade Workflow Composer?</li>
<li>Where can you <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/install/">download the software from</a> and how can you get in touch with the StackStorm developers?</li>
</ul>
