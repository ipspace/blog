<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>During our <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2016/08/software-defined-navel-gazing.html">summer team-building podcast</a> we agreed it would be fun to record a few episodes along the “<em>how do I become a programmer</em>” theme and figured out that Elisa Jasinska would be a perfect first candidate.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago we finally got together and started our chat with campfire stories remembering how we got started with networking and programming.<!--more--></p>
<p>Other topics of the podcast include:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>What formal education would help you become a programmer?</li>
<li>Which programming language would you use and why would it be Perl?</li>
<li>How could you combine network-related work with programming? <li>Why does that make perfect sense, and why one might slide more and more toward programming.</li>
<li>How being a network operations engineer and a programmer enhances your career options?</li>
<li>How could a hard-code networking engineer start moving into programming?</li>
<li>Why it’s useful to start with an existing open-source project and modify it to fit your needs.</li>
</li>
</ul>
