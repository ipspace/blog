title: Could You Use IS-IS Instead of BGP for Routing on Hosts?

<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>One of my readers sent me an interesting question a while ago:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Isn’t IS-IS a better fit for building <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/04/rearchitecting-l3-only-networks.html">L3-only networks</a> than BGP, particularly considering that IS-IS already has a protocol to communicate with the end systems (ES-IS)?</blockquote>
<p>In theory, he’s correct (see also <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/05/reinventing-clns-with-l3-only-forwarding.html">this blog post</a>).<!--more--></p>
<p>In practice, ES-IS part never moved from CLNS to IP support because nobody felt the need to implement any host-to-router communication (apart from ARP and ICMP) in the IPv4 world. IPv6 sort-of reinvented ES-IS with Duplicate Address Detection and Neighbor Discovery, but never enforced the need for an end system to continuously announce itself. </p>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>Neighbor Discovery implementation on a router (ARP or IPv6 ND) could continuously probe the end hosts to verify they’re still reachable. Cisco is doing that <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2007/06/ar.html">whenever you’re using CEF switching</a>, and Cumulus Networks uses the same approach with their <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/08/layer-3-only-data-center-networks-with.html">Redistribute ARP</a> functionality, as do several EVPN implementations.</p>
<p>In the IPv4 world that’s purely an implementation decision. IPv6 includes <em>Neighbor Unreachability Detection </em>but only for “<em>the neighbors to which a node is sending packets</em>” (<a href="#section-7.3">section 7.3 of RFC 4861</a>). Doing that for idle nodes is yet again implementation-dependent (NUD is traffic-driven, while we're looking for a topology-driven mechanism). In any case, we're misusing L2 address resolution protocol as a host reachability protocol, and the burden to figure out what’s going on is on the router, not on the end-host as it should be in a scalable network architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: The only way to get somewhat reliable IP address mobility (or service advertisement) in an IP environment is to use a routing protocol. Some people prefer RIP, others use BGP… just make sure you’re <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/09/why-would-i-use-bgp-and-not-ospf.html">not using OSPF</a> ;)</p>
