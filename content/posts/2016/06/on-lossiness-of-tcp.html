<p>When someone tells you that “<em>TCP is a lossy protocol</em>” during a job interview, don’t throw him out immediately – he was just trusting the Internet a bit too much (click to enlarge).</p>

<p class="note">Everyone has a bad hair day, and it really doesn’t matter who published that text… but if you’re publishing technical information, at least try to <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2016/01/whatever-happened-to-do-no-harm.html">do no harm</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>Let’s do a step-by-step walk through that bit of wisdom:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">The foundation of TCP/IP design is that the network is unreliable and packets will be lost.</blockquote>
<p>True.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">In fact, the TCP protocol demands this feature to determine the maximum possible transfer rate.<span class="apple-converted-space" style="color: 222222;"> </span></blockquote>
<p>Wrong. TCP reacts to packet drops and delays (increased round-trip-time; RTT). It turns out it’s better to delay packets than to drop them on low-speed links with a small number of TCP sessions, and it’s really easy to reproduce the <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2008/jul/30/policing-versus-shaping/">measurement Jeremy Stretch did a long time ago</a>.</p>
<p>We could go into a lengthy discussion on when it’s time to start dropping the packets instead of buffering them (see also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bufferbloat">Bufferbloat</a>), and how TCP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_Congestion_Notification">ECN</a> could be used to alleviate congestion before the dropping starts, but that’s way beyond the point.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">So it’s impossible to make TCP lossless, it’s designed into its operation.</blockquote>
<p>You don’t have to trust me or Wikipedia, but you might trust the authors of <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt">RFC 793</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">TCP provides for reliable inter-process communication between pairs of processes in host computers attached to distinct but interconnected computer communication networks.</blockquote>
<p>I’d guess that <em>reliable</em> and <em>lossy</em> usually aren’t considered synonyms.</p>
<p>Back to the lossiness of TCP… seems it has some impact on QoS:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">This is why Quality of Service never works. TCP will drop packets in almost every systems because there is less bandwidth in the network than the endpoints can transmit.</blockquote>
<p>Another sound bite for a job interview, right? ;) It’s not totally wrong:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Internet-wide QoS is a <a href="http://www.internetsociety.org/qos-emperors-wardrobe-geoff-huston-isp-column">pipe dream</a>. See also <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/10/douglas-comer-on-future-of-networking.html">interview with Douglas Comer</a>.</li>
<li>Consistent QoS across more than one administrative domain is usually mission impossible.</li>
<li>In many cases it’s easier to <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/06/can-we-just-throw-more-bandwidth-at.html">throw more bandwidth at the problem</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>you can’t throw bandwidth at the problem, </li>
<li>you can separate your traffic into few coarse classes, and </li>
<li>you realize QoS is always a zero-sum game</li>
</ul>
<p>… then you can use QoS mechanisms like policing, shaping, queuing or dropping to improve the service offered to some traffic at the <em>cost of other traffic</em><em>. </em>Just keep in mind that you’re trading link cost for increased operational complexity (and associated costs).</p>
