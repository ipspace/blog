<p>A <a href="https://packetpushers.net/back-basics-dijkstra-spf/">blog post on Packet Pushers</a> contained a quote by E. W. Dijkstra (of the SPF fame) and while trying to figure out whether that quote was real I stumbled upon his <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD898.html">keynote address</a> from a 1984 ACM conference (<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd08xx/EWD898.PDF">original</a>). Not surprisingly, nothing has changed in the last 30+ years…<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite">Since the Romans have taught us "Simplex Veri Sigillum" —that is: simplicity is the hallmark of truth— we should know better, but complexity continues to have a morbid attraction. […] The sore truth is that complexity sells better.</blockquote>
<p>MacGyvers are also not a new phenomenon:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">And it is even more diabolical in that we even use the complexity of our own constructs to impress ourselves. I have often been impressed by the cleverness of my own first solutions; invariably the joy of the subsequent discovery how to streamline the argument was tempered by a feeling of regret that my cleverness was unnecessary after all.</blockquote>
<p>Neither is the tendency to underestimate complexity of other people’s jobs…</p>
<blockquote class="cite">The intrinsic difficulty of the programming task has never been refuted, it has only been denied because admitting it was socially unacceptable.</blockquote>
<p>… or the wonderful ideas of “X will get rid of Y”:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">People tend to forget that "doing away with the programmer" was COBOL's major original objective.</blockquote>
<p class="more">Replace “programmer” with “networking engineer” and COBOL with SDN ;)</p>
<p>Finally, these great ideas usually fail spectacularly:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Fifteen years later, 80% of the world's programming force was absorbed by the use of COBOL, a figure which gives us some idea of how effective that elixir has been.</blockquote>
<p>I wonder what we’ll be saying about SDN fifteen years from now…</p>
<p>I could go on and on quoting mr. Dijkstra’s ideas, but it’s much better to <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD898.html">enjoy the original</a>.</p>
