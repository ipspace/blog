<p>A while ago I discussed <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2016/05/is-xmpp-control-or-management-plane.html">whether XMPP is a control- or management-plane protocol</a> (spoiler: it depends). How about OVSDB? Here’s another question from one of my readers:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Why is Openflow considered as control plane protocol and OVSDB management plane protocol if both are relying on SDN controller? Is it because Openflow can directly modify the dataplane?</blockquote>
<p>SDN controllers can use control- or management-plane protocols to get the job done.<!--more--> If an SDN controller is <em>configuring a control plane </em>in an independent device, it’s clearly using a management-plane protocol, if it’s <em>exchanging information with peers </em>or <em>configuring forwarding entries</em> it’s using a control-plane protocol.</p>
<p>The vanilla Open vSwitch implementation uses OpenFlow to configure forwarding entries, and OVSDB to configure interfaces and datapaths (virtual switches) in OVS, resulting in the idea that OVSDB is a management-plane protocol.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7047">OVSDB</a> (Open vSwitch Database Management Protocol) is (like its name implies) nothing more than a database manipulation protocol – something like SQL with JSON encoding and a few extensions. You can use OVSDB to query database tables, or to modify (update, insert or delete) their contents.</p>
<p>If you use OVSDB to work with interface or datapath tables, you’re manipulating the device configuration – OVSDB is a management-plane protocol.</p>
<p class="info">Based on my limited understanding of OVS it’s perfectly feasible to use OVS as a traditional bridge and use OVSDB to configure it.</p>
<p>There’s another use for OVSDB: you can use it to exchange <a href="http://openvswitch.org/support/dist-docs/vtep.5.html">MAC-to-VTEP mappings</a> (and a lot of other information) between an SDN controller and hardware VTEP (VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint) gateways. In that case, OVSDB is clearly a control-plane protocol.</p>
<p><strong>To summarize</strong>: OVSDB (like XMPP or TCP) is yet another pretty universal tool. Whether it’s used as a control- or management-plane protocol is an implementation detail.</p>
