title: Build Your Own Service Provider Gear on Software Gone Wild

---

<p>A few days after I published a blog post arguing that <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/03/you-want-your-network-to-be-like.html">most service providers cannot possibly copy Google’s ideas</a> Giacomo Bernardi wrote a comment saying “<em>well, w</em><em>e managed to build our own gear.</em>”</p>
<p>Initially I thought they built their own Linux distribution on top of x86 server, but what Giacomo Bernardi described in <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_59-Building_Your_Own_Service_Provider_Gear.mp3">Episode 59</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a> goes way beyond that:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Together with an ODM manufacturer they built their own hardware;</li>
<li>They pushed their hardware through rigorous safety, environmental and emission testing – after all, those boxes sit out there in the wild attached to a radio tower;</li>
<li>They build their own Linux distribution and hardened it as much as possible – sending a technician to a remote mountain to fix a failed software upgrade is a non-starter;</li>
<li>Using <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/02/6wind-solving-virtual-appliance.html">6Wind</a> library they implemented a highly distributed forwarding architecture using dozens of low-cost CPU cores;</li>
<li>Together with university researchers they built a central controller that solves the centralized traffic engineering challenge;</li>
<li>On top of everything else they implemented their own CLI and network management system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each one of those bullets would be good enough to trigger VC funding for a startup, but they did all of that with a team of just a few people… and deployed it in large-scale production… in approximately a year. Comparing what such a small team can do with all the hype and unicorn dust bursting out of Silicon Valley makes one really depressed.</p>
