<p>One of my readers was listening to the <a href="/2014/09/snabb-switch-deep-dive-on-software-gone.html">Snabb Switch podcast</a> and started wondering “<em>whether it’s possible to leverage and adopt these bleeding-edge technologies without a substantial staff of savvy programmers?</em>”</p>
<p>Short answer: <strong>No</strong>. Someone has to do the heavy lifting, regardless of whether you have programmers on-site, outsource the work to contractors, or pay vendors to do it.<!--more--></p>
<p>Also, someone has to support, troubleshoot, maintain and improve the product over the years to come. This is the also the most-overlooked aspect of any project, particularly homegrown automation solutions. When you roll out your solution into production you’re not done – your job has just started for real.</p>
<p>My reader continued his email by explaining how they work today: </p>
<blockquote class="cite">Whenever we adopt bleeding-edge technologies, it’s innovation with training wheels. We try new things but usually with someone holding our hand. There was a recent debate about whether to attempt Openstack internally or via third-party such as Mirantis.</blockquote>
<p>In most cases <em>Innovation with training wheels </em>is the only thing that makes sense, regardless of whether it’s personal growth (read: attend trainings) or introduction of new technologies… unless of course you’re doing something fundamentally new.</p>
<p>Reinventing the wheels (as opposed to having a helping hand that supplies the training wheels) is usually a waste of time - I’ve seen several teams that wasted years (real-time years, not man-years) trying to get OpenStack working from vanilla distro instead of buying a ready-to-use product.</p>
<p>On the other hand, unless you want to work with your consultants (or system integrator or vendor) for years, you <strong>must </strong>be ready to take over and strip the training wheels eventually.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Products like Cumulus-on-whitebox and Snabb Switches bring opportunities for either highly customized needs or even cost-savings when compared to big-name network vendors. But the argument inevitably comes back to whether or not the cost-savings is worth the risk and headaches of programming and supporting.</blockquote>
<p>It depends on how big you are. You’ll pay the vendor’s R&amp;D and support costs (+ sales and marketing) or you’ll pay your own programmers or contractors. If you’re big enough it makes sense. If you have special needs (high-frequency trading comes to mind) or operate at the very bleeding edge, it might be the only option you have. If you only need a few switches it’s a waste of time.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that the infrastructure inevitably becomes a commodity over time. We’re seeing the early stages of that process in networking - <a href="/2015/08/video-what-is-cumulus-linux-all-about.html">data center switches running Linux</a> with a <a href="/2016/01/openswitch-deep-dive-on-software-gone.html">device driver that controls the switching silicon</a>. We had open-source infrastructure including vendor support in reasonably-high-speed x86 packet processing for years (<a href="/2015/04/pfring-deep-dive-with-luca-deri-on.html">PF_RING</a>, netmap…). The same process has started in bleeding-edge x86-based networking (solutions like 6WIND or Snabb Switch).</p>
<p>Reinventing that infrastructure clearly doesn’t make sense - it’s like writing your own CRM instead of using SalesForce (or another similar product). </p>
<p>My reader concluded his email by saying:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">However, I refuse to fall into that narrow-minded and lazy mindset of just going with the usual big-name, incumbent vendor over and over (even after the CIO asks if there are opportunities to reduce costs).</blockquote>
<p>If you need a <a href="/2014/10/all-you-need-are-two-top-of-rack.html">few instances of a product</a>, <a href="/2016/01/dell-os10-and-cumulus-linux.html">go with an incumbent vendor</a>. It’s not worth risking your whole data center just to get a slightly cheaper pair of load balancers or firewalls. If you need a few thousand boxes, it makes sense to look around. In between there’s the usual gray area.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that reducing CapEx (= buying a product) often increases OpEx (= building a product), and you have to be very careful and realistic in your estimates. The costs of building a product are usually underestimated by order of magnitude, particularly by the people who never built one (see also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>), and the costs of maintaining a product (particularly syncing your fork when the underlying codebase evolves) are usually conveniently ignored.</p>
<p>Finally, doing the same thing over and over and expecting reduced costs is close the <a href="http://www.technocracyinc.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/einstein-insanity-quote.png">well-known definition of insanity</a>. The real cost-savings come from <a href="/2014/09/youve-been-doing-same-thing-for-last-20.html">changing</a> your <a href="/2013/11/typical-enterprise-application.html">application development and deployment processes</a> and removing the <a href="/2013/04/this-is-what-makes-networking-so-complex.html">unnecessary kludges</a> and reverse engineering that happen between Dev and Prod.</p>
