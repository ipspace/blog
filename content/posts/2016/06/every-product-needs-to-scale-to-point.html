title: Every Product Needs to Scale… to a Point

<p>Long time ago in a <a href="https://packetpushers.net/podcast/podcasts/show-242-where-have-all-the-good-staff-gone/">podcast far far away</a> Greg and Ethan pondered whether networking solutions need to scale or not, and obviously one cannot disagree with their generic conclusion that enterprises need just-good-enough solutions and not Google-scale architectures.</p>
<p>However, do keep in mind that:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Not all enterprises are of the same size. Something that works wonderfully for a single-site SMB shop might not work for a larger enterprise;</li>
<li>Sometimes a solution doesn’t scale even to the small enterprise size (<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/12/could-we-use-openflow-for-load-balancing.html">OpenFlow-based load balancing comes to mind</a>) or is so broken that it <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/09/long-distance-irf-fabric-works-best-in.html">should never have been allowed to escape from PowerPoint slides</a>;</li>
<li>A solution that can survive Google-scale deployment is obviously better engineered and implemented than a hodgepodge of kludges thrown together until the mix <a href="http://etherealmind.com/blessay-proof-of-concept-testing-should-never-happen/">worked in a PoC lab</a>, so you might be better off using that solution than an “enterprise-grade” product designed to <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/01/long-distance-vmotion-stretched-ha.html">exploit lack of inter-team communication</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, the right answer (as always) is <em>it depends</em>, and if you want to go beyond that (and you should) you have to:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Understand the requirements (both functional requirements and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/10/all-you-need-are-two-top-of-rack.html">expected traffic load</a>);</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/03/response-why-technology-still-matters.html">Understand the architecture and the limitations of the solution(s)</a> you’re considering for your deployment;</li>
<li>Select the optimal solution that meets your requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>BTW, following this process might make you worthy of having the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect"><em>architect</em></a><em> </em>or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer"><em>engineer</em></a><em> </em>job title. <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2016/01/the-sad-state-of-enterprise-networking.html">Buying an enterprise product because you trust your beloved $vendor</a> makes you a consumer.</p>
<h4>Getting hands dirty</h4><p>Are you building a new data center and trying to figure out which vendor to go with? You’ll find an overview of potential requirements to consider and fabric architectures in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics">Data Center Fabrics webinar</a>. Prefer a more interactive approach? You’ll get plenty of that in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center?utm_source=blog"><em>Building the Next-Generation Data Center</em></a> online course.</p>
