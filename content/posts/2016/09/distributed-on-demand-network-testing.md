title: Distributed On-Demand Network Testing (ToDD) with Matt Oswalt
url: /2016/09/distributed-on-demand-network-testing/
---
In March 2016 my friend Matt Oswalt announced a [distributed network testing framework](https://keepingitclassless.net/2016/03/test-driven-network-automation/) that he used for validation in his network automation / continuous integration projects. Initial tests included ping and DNS probes, and he [added HTTP testing](https://keepingitclassless.net/2016/05/introducing-http-testing-todd/) in May 2016.

The project continues to grow (and already got [its own Github](https://github.com/toddproject) and [documentation](https://todd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) page) and Matt was kind enough to share the news and future plans in [Episode 63](http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_63-ToDD.mp3) of [Software Gone Wild](http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild).

To ask questions about the project, join the [Todd channel on networktocode Slack team](https://networktocode.slack.com/messages/todd/) (self-registration at [slack.networktocode.com](http://slack.networktocode.com/))
