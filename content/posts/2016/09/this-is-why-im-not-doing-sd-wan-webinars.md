One of my long-time regular readers sent me this question:

> I was wondering if you have had any interest in putting together an SD-WAN overview/update similar to what you do with data center fabrics where you cover the different product offerings, differentiators, solution scorecard...

That would be a good idea. Unfortunately the SD-WAN vendors aren't exactly helping.
<!--more-->
One of rules I use in the Data Center Fabrics webinar is "*talk about features, not futures*" where *features* are defined as "*things described in* [*product documentation*](https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/10/we-need-product-documentation-not-just.html) *on public vendor web site*". This is the list of SD-WAN vendors that would meet the requirements:

-   [Cisco IWAN](http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/solutions/CVD/Feb2016/CVD-IWANDesignGuide-FEB16.pdf)
-   [Silver Peak Unity](https://www.silver-peak.com/support/user-documentation)

This is the list of vendors that claim to have SD-WAN solution in their marketing materials, but I wasn't able to find any supporting documentation on their web site in September 2016 (in alphabetical order):

-   Cloudgenix
-   Nuage
-   Velocloud
-   Viptela
-   Riverbed

It's no fun comparing two vendors, so I'll wait a bit till at least two more of them see the light (there's also the [backlog of other great things](https://trello.com/b/9LhRHSsv/ipspace-net-webinar-development) I'd like to talk about)

Note: I've probably missed something, so please provide more fun links in the comments.
