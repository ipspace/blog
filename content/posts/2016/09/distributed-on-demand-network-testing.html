<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>In March 2016 my friend Matt Oswalt announced a <a href="https://keepingitclassless.net/2016/03/test-driven-network-automation/">distributed network testing framework</a> that he used for validation in his network automation / continuous integration projects. Initial tests included ping and DNS probes, and he <a href="https://keepingitclassless.net/2016/05/introducing-http-testing-todd/">added HTTP testing</a> in May 2016.</p>
<p>The project continues to grow (and already got <a href="https://github.com/toddproject">its own Github</a> and <a href="https://todd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a> page) and Matt was kind enough to share the news and future plans in <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_63-ToDD.mp3">Episode 63</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a>.</p>
<p>To ask questions about the project, join the <a href="https://networktocode.slack.com/messages/todd/">Todd channel on networktocode Slack team</a> (self-registration at <a href="http://slack.networktocode.com/">slack.networktocode.com</a>)</p>
