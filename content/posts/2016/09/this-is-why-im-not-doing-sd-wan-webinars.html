<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>One of my long-time regular readers sent me this question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I was wondering if you have had any interest in putting together an SD-WAN overview/update similar to what you do with data center fabrics where you cover the different product offerings, differentiators, solution scorecard…</blockquote>
<p>That would be a good idea. Unfortunately the SD-WAN vendors aren’t exactly helping.<!--more--></p>
<p>One of rules I use in the Data Center Fabrics webinar is “<em>talk about features, not futures</em>” where <em>features</em> are defined as “<em>things described in </em><a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/10/we-need-product-documentation-not-just.html"><em>product documentation</em></a><em> on public vendor web site</em>”. This is the list of SD-WAN vendors that would meet the requirements:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/solutions/CVD/Feb2016/CVD-IWANDesignGuide-FEB16.pdf">Cisco IWAN</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.silver-peak.com/support/user-documentation">Silver Peak Unity</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the list of vendors that claim to have SD-WAN solution in their marketing materials, but I wasn’t able to find any supporting documentation on their web site in September 2016 (in alphabetical order):</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Cloudgenix</li>
<li>Nuage</li>
<li>Velocloud</li>
<li>Viptela</li>
<li>Riverbed</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s no fun comparing two vendors, so I’ll wait a bit till at least two more of them see the light (there’s also the <a href="https://trello.com/b/9LhRHSsv/ipspace-net-webinar-development">backlog of other great things</a> I’d like to talk about)</p>
<p>Note: I’ve probably missed something, so please provide more fun links in the comments.</p>
