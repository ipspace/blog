<p>In the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Designs">Leaf-and-Spine Fabric Designs webinar series</a> we started with the simplest possible design: non-redundant server connectivity with bridging within a ToR switch and routing across the fabric.</p>
<p>After I explained the basics (including routing protocol selection, route summarization, link aggregation and addressing guidelines), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ddutt">Dinesh Dutt</a> described how <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Clos/7.15 - Using BGP in Leaf-and-Spine Fabrics.mp4">network architects use BGP when building leaf-and-spine fabrics</a>.</p>
