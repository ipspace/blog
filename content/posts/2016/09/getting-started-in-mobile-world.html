<p>Got this challenge from one of my readers:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I've recently changed jobs and I am currently working for a telco. The problem is that I have no idea of what they are talking about when they mention SGSN, GGSN, Gi, Gn, etc... I only know routing and switching stuff :(.</blockquote>
<p>Obviously he tried to search for information and failed.<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite">Wikipedia articles seem to assume that you already know your stuff, and it just becomes one hell of a rabbit hole.</blockquote>
<p>So he's wondering:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Is there any "unifying" book that goes from basics to more advanced topics, just to get me started?</blockquote>
<p>I guess he's not alone. I tried to understand those same concepts not so long ago and also gave up after trying (unsuccessfully) to decipher LTE standards. Any pointer to reasonable entry-level material would be highly appreciated!</p>
