Dinesh Dutt was the guest speaker in the second [Leaf-and-Spine Fabric Design session](http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Designs). After I explained how you can [use ARP/ND information to build a layer-3-only data center](https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/08/layer-3-only-data-center-networks-with.html) fabric that still supports IP address mobility [Dinesh described the details of Cumulus Linux redistribute ARP functionality](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Clos/7.25%20-%20Building%20a%20Pure%20L3%20Data%20Center%20with%20Cumulus%20Linux.mp4) and demoed how it works in a live data center.
