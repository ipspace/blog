title: You Don’t Need Programming Skills to Build Network Automation Solutions

<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>I got several questions along the lines of “<em>Do I need programming skills to attend the </em><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions"><em>Building Network Automation Solutions</em></a><em> course?</em>”</p>
<p>Short answer: No.<!--more--></p>
<p>As an aside: while programming won't be a mandatory part of the course, knowing a bit of Python never hurts (that's why I put two online Python 101 classes on the "additional recommended materials" list). </p>
<p>However, you’ll be able to do most of the assignments in pure Ansible. While that might get a bit <a href="http://automation.ipspace.net/Example:Parsing_Text_Printouts_within_Ansible_Playbooks">tedious and convoluted</a> (and would be better served with a Python plugin) it can be done. The most important part is to understand what can be done, what tools to use to get the job done in a reasonably optimum way, and when/where to ask for help.</p>
<p>However, you will have to master what academics call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking"><em>computational thinking</em></a> - the ability to split large problems into smaller pieces, and to describe individual pieces as a sequence of well-defined steps.</p>
<p>So don’t be afraid – you’ll get the job done no matter what. However, it won’t hurt if you <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions#register">register for the course</a> ;)</p>
