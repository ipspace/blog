<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>Another year <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/723.html">swooshed by</a>… it’s time for another <em>what have we been doing in this year </em>blog post.</p>
<p>Most important bit first: ipSpace.net is slowly morphing from a personal project into a (hopefully interesting) learning platform with <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Authors">almost 30 authors</a> creating or participating in ipSpace.net webinars or online courses.<!--more--></p>
<p>No wonder the ipSpace.net content continues to grow. Right now you’ll find ~150 hours of online content on ipSpace.net (over 800 videos from 58 webinars – statistics <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual">here</a>) and over 2700 blog posts on blog.ipSpace.net (can’t imagine when I wrote them).</p>
<p>And here’s what we did in 2016. SDN and related topics first:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>I completed the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Roadmap/SDN_and_OpenFlow_webinars">SDN curriculum</a> with additional <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN_Use_Cases">four hours of SDN Use Cases</a> and a totally revamped <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Software_Defined_Networking_(SDN)">SDN 101</a> webinar.</li>
<li>David Gee did <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/NETCONF_and_YANG">two additional NETCONF sessions</a>, including NETCONF deep dive, and Junos and Cisco IOS implementation details.</li>
<li>Julian Lucek (Juniper) described the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/PCEP_and_BGP-LS_Deep_Dive">details of BGP-LS and PCEP</a>.</li>
<li>Jeff Tantsura did an <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Segment_Routing_Introduction">overview of Segment Routing</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data centers:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Matt Oswalt and Dinesh Dutt described <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Docker">Docker fundamentals</a> and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Docker_Networking_Fundamentals">Docker Networking</a>. </li>
<li>Together with Dinesh Dutt (Cumulus), Roger Lapuh (Avaya) and Lukas Krattiger (Cisco) we created 8 hours of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Architectures">leaf-and-spine fabric design guidelines</a>. I also invited a great engineer from one of Cisco’s competitors, but for whatever incomprehensible reason he got a gag order a few days before the session. Some vendors hate third-party discussion of their technologies.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics">Data Center Fabrics</a> webinar got a much-needed overhaul of the <em>architectures </em>and <em>requirements </em>section plus the regular update sessions covering new products and features from Arista, Brocade, Cisco, Juniper and Avaya (guest session by Roger Lapuh), for a total of over 17 hours of data center switching content.</li>
<li>JR Rivers (Cumulus) tried to explain whether it’s better to have deep packet buffers (and increased latency) or packet drops in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Networks,_Buffers,_and_Drops">Networks, Buffers and Drops webinar</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also started completing the network automation curriculum:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>In August we started with <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Network_Automation_101">Network Automation 101</a>;</li>
<li>Elisa Jasinska described <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Network_Automation_Tools">numerous open-source network automation tools</a>;</li>
<li>We had three <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible Updates</a> sessions covering Ansible networking modules, YAML, Jinja2, Ansible basics, playbooks, and a few deep-dive topics, resulting in 8 hours of Ansible-related content. Further sessions are planned for early 2017.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, even though I stopped doing sponsored webinars, you’ll still find plenty of free webinars on ipSpace.net. In most cases the authors decided to do them for free, and I financed logistics, editing and post-production. The free webinars include:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Software_Defined_Networking_(SDN)">SDN 101</a> (the very last sponsored webinar I did, but at least I didn't have to be polite toward technologies I believe to be broken)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/PCEP_and_BGP-LS_Deep_Dive">BGP-LS and PCEP</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Docker_Networking_Fundamentals">Docker Networking</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Networks,_Buffers,_and_Drops">Networks, Buffers and Drops</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I also plan to make guest parts of some other webinars public (or at least accessible with trial <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual">subscription</a>), but want to have them edited first… and that takes way too long. Right now there are ~40 hours of content waiting to be edited.</p>
<p>So, that’s it for 2016. I’m going (mostly) offline, but might publish a few network automation posts next week while preparing content for the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">January network automation course</a>. I wish you a quiet and happy Christmas and all the best in 2017!</p>
