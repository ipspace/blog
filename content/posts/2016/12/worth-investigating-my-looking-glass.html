<p>If you're a networking engineer, sysadmin, or NetDevOps guru preferring the power of CLI over carpal-syndrome-inducing GUI you might like the <a href="https://github.com/mehrdadrad/mylg">My Looking Glass</a> tool developed by Mehrdad Arshad Rad. Haven't tried it out, but the intro on GitHub page looks promising.</p>
<p>If you decide to try it out (or already did) please share your experience in a comment. Thank you!</p>
