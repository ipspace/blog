<p>One of my readers sent me a simple question: “<em>Do you plan to have a Python for Networking Engineers webinar?</em>”</p>
<p>Short answer: no immediate plans.</p>
<p>Here are just a few reasons:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>There are several good <em>Python</em><em> for Networking Engineers </em>offerings out there, from <a href="https://pynet.twb-tech.com/">Kirk Byers’ online course</a> to <a href="http://www.mylearning.ch/schulungen/kurs/new-network-automation-with-python.html">Urs Baumann’s week-long classroom training</a>.</li>
<li>While it doesn’t hurt to have some baseline programming knowledge, I don’t really believe in <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/12/you-dont-need-programming-skills-to.html">programming being mandatory for networking engineers</a>. I would always prefer to <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/06/will-network-engineers-become.html">get the job done by a specialist</a> who has programming experience comparable to my networking experience.</li>
<li>The pragmatic one: I have <a href="https://trello.com/b/9LhRHSsv/ipspace-net-webinar-development">too many other things in the pipeline</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>His next question: </p>
<blockquote class="cite">Do you think there is a need for python for network automation, or the Ansible will resolve this issue, without being involved directly with a programming language?</blockquote>
<p>You can get a lot of things done with Ansible or other tools. However, these tools (including Ansible) are not general-purpose programming languages, and at least <a href="http://automation.ipspace.net/Example:Parsing_Text_Printouts_within_Ansible_Playbooks">Ansible sucks at data munging and manipulation</a>.</p>
<p>There will always be need for more sophisticated glue, and a programming language (Python, for example) will always be needed to provide it. However, as explained above, I don't necessarily believe in writing that code myself. Well, I would probably do it as a proof-of-concept, but would try to get a programmer fluent in Python to (re)do before the code gets anywhere near a real-life project.</p>
