title: Generating OSPF, BGP and MPLS/VPN Configurations from Network Data Model
url: /2016/12/generating-ospf-bgp-and-mplsvpn.html
---

<p>Over a month ago I decided to create a lab network to figure out how to solve an <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2016/11/optimal-inter-as-routing-challenge.html">interesting Inter-AS MPLS/VPN routing challenge</a>. Instead of configuring half a dozen routers I decided to develop a fully-automated deployment because it will <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">make my life easier</a>.</p>
<p>I finally got to a point where OSPF, LDP, BGP (IPv4 and VPNv4) and MPLS/VPN configurations are created, deployed and verified automatically.<!--more--> No, I still haven’t solved the original problem, but it was more fun developing the <a href="https://github.com/ipspace/MPLS-infrastructure">Ansible playbooks</a> anyway.</p>
<p>Next step (instead of figuring out the solution to the original problem): multi-vendor support. If anyone wants to contribute Junos configurations please send me a pull request (or an email).</p>
<p class="more">Eventually I’ll write the documentation (and a lengthy series of blog posts explaining how the whole thing works), for the moment I keep pretending the source code is <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2016/09/source-code-is-not-standards.html">self-documenting</a>.</p>
<p>Want to build a similar solution on your own? You’ll learn how to do that in my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Network Automation online course</a>.</p>
