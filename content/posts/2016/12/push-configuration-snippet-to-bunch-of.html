title: Push Configuration Snippet to a Bunch of Cisco IOS Devices

---

<p>As I was trying to automate configuration deployment in a multi-router Cisco IOS lab, I got to a point where the only way of figuring out what was going on was to log commands on Cisco IOS devices. <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2006/11/cli-command-logging-without-tacacs.html">Not a big deal</a>, but I hate logging into a dozen boxes and configuring the same few lines on all of them (or removing them afterwards).</p>
<p>Time for another playbook: <a href="https://github.com/ipspace/ansible-examples/tree/master/Trace-Executed-Commands">this one</a> can push one of many (configurable) configuration snippets to a group of Cisco IOS devices defined in an Ansible inventory file.</p>
<p>Interesting? Want to do something more complex? Join the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Network Automation online course</a>.</p>
