<p>High-speed scale-out load balancing is a Mission Impossible. You can get <em>the correct abstraction at the wrong cost </em>or <em>another layer of indirection </em>(to paraphrase the authors of <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/building-and-scaling-fastly-network-part-2-balancing-requests">Fastly load balancing solution</a>).</p>
<p>However, once every third blue moon you might get a team of smart engineers focused on optimal solutions to real-life problems. The result: <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/building-and-scaling-fastly-network-part-2-balancing-requests">a layer of misdirection</a>, a combination of hardware ECMP and server-level traffic redirection. Enjoy!</p>
