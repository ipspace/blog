<p>Several subscribers told me they’d need more details on leaf-and-spine fabric designs. As they say: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVBwmAP30hM">your wish is my command</a> – the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Designs">upcoming update session</a> of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Architectures">leaf-and-spine fabric architectures</a> webinar will have more details on all possible combinations of layer-2 and layer-3 fabrics.</p>
<p>The first session (on March 3<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">rd</span>) will cover layer-3 fabrics. We’ll start with the basics:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>How do we build a simple non-redundant layer-3 fabric?</li>
<li>How do we add server-to-network redundancy?</li>
<li>Do we really need VLANs and MLAG between ToR switches?</li>
<li>Which routing protocol should you use?</li>
<li>Is it OK to use unnumbered interfaces on the core links and why would you want to do that?</li>
<li>Why is route summarization in a leaf-and-spine fabric a bad idea?</li>
<li>Do you need links between spine switches?</li>
<li>How do you stop the traffic from traversing the fabric more than once?</li>
</ul>
<p>After covering the basics, we’ll start a deep dive with the guest star: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ddutt">Dinesh Dutt</a>, Chief Scientist at Cumulus Networks. He’ll cover the intricacies of BGP and OSPF design (for example: do you use the same AS number on all spines?) and describe how the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/02/bgp-configuration-made-simple-with.html">cool features Cumulus added to the Quagga routing suite</a> simplify the data center fabrics.</p>
