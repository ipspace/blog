title: ASICs Behind the Scenes

<p>A lot of people love to talk about ASICs and merchant silicon, but very few really understand the basics. Now there’s a quick way to fix that: watch the <a href="https://vimeo.com/155635184">excellent Tech Field Day video with Dave Zacks</a> from Cisco Systems.<!--more--></p>
<p>If you know nothing about ASICs, the first part of the video is pure gold – it describes the basics of the underlying technologies and development processes as well as differences between generic CPUs, FPGAs and ASICs.</p>
<p>The second part of the video is the reason Cisco decided to do this presentation: Dave started praising the beauties of Cisco’s ASICs, including the recirculation and programmable pipeline… but even though there’s plenty of marketing there, the video is still well worth your time.</p>
<p class="note">BTW, the programmable ASIC pipeline isn’t exactly a Cisco-only feature. It’s also available in Intel’s FM6000 and probably in <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/06/software-defined-hardware-forwarding.html">new HP ASICs we discussed on Software Gone Wild</a>.</p>
<p>Finally: we all know that someone paid for that video to be shot, but whenever you get something valuable, it’s time to say <em>thank you</em> regardless of how and why it was produced (particularly if it’s free) – so THANK YOU Dave and Cisco Enterprise Switching!</p>
