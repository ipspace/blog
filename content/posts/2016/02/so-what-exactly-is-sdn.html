title: So What Exactly Is SDN?
url: /2016/02/so-what-exactly-is-sdn.html
---

<p>Five years after the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/03/open-networking-foundation-fabric.html">SDN hype exploded</a>, it remains as meaningless as <em>Cloud</em>, and it seems that all we’re left with is a plethora of vendors engaged in SDN-washing their products. </p>
<p class="more">Even when a group of highly intelligent engineers considering these topics on a daily basis gets together <a href="http://techfieldday.com/video/networking-field-day-11-delegate-sdn-roundtable/">they don’t get very far</a> apart from a great question: “<em>what business problem is it supposed to solve?</em>” (or maybe they got distracted by irrelevant hot-air opinions).</p>
<p>Is it still worth trying to find a useful definition of SDN? It seems it’s easier to list what SDN is not like I’ll be doing in the free <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Software_Defined_Networking_(SDN)">Introduction to SDN webinar</a> on February 10<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span>. Let’s see:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><strong>Centralized control plane</strong> <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/06/centralized-control-is-not-centralized.html">doesn’t make much sense</a> (apart from a few <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/12/running-open-daylight-in-production.html">niche scenarios</a>) and smart people use OpenFlow to <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/05/openflow-in-hp-campus-solutions-on.html">augment existing network</a>. <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/11/the-numerous-levels-of-sdn-reality.html">Stubborn misleading marketin</a>g from ONF doesn’t help either.</li>
<li><strong>Packet forwarding done is software</strong>? <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/09/snabb-switch-deep-dive-on-software-gone.html">Doing dozens of gigabits on x86 server is cool</a>, but we’ve been software-based packet forwarding forever (remember the original AGS routers?)</li>
<li><strong>Whitebox switching</strong>? <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/08/video-what-is-cumulus-linux-all-about.html">Nice concept</a> that might totally disrupt the networking industry, but it’s just a packaging and licensing challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Network automation</strong>? <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Network_Programmability_101">Definitely useful</a>, but one would hope for something more.</li>
<li><strong>Applications talking to the network</strong>? There might be some niche use cases (edge marking, high-volume file transfers), but we’ve also seen <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/10/the-lack-of-historic-knowledge-is-so.html">how well IntServ</a> and <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2009/06/what-went-wrong-atm.html">ATM-to-the-desktop</a> worked. </li>
</ul>
<p>So what’s left? Join me on February 10<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span> and let’s find out.
