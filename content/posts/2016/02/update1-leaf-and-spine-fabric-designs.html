<p>I somewhat expected that the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Designs">leaf-and-spine fabrics designs</a> webinar won’t be as short as I initially planned it to be, but when I started developing the scenarios and talking with guest speakers the whole thing exploded into a four-session saga (or maybe we’ll end up with the fifth session of a <a href="#Novels">four-part trilogy</a>).</p>
<p>Here’s a short update on what’s planned and where we are at the moment:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>The webinar will cover three obvious major scenarios: layer-3 fabrics, layer-2 fabrics and mixed layer-2-3 fabrics.</li>
<li>Each scenario will be split into at least two: non-redundant and redundant server-to-network connectivity.</li>
<li>Additional sections will cover routing on servers and connectivity to external world via routed links or network services.</li>
</ul>
<p>In every session I’ll go through the basics and design guidelines, and a guest speaker will do a deep-dive into a particular implementation.</p>
<p>The current plan is to have four sessions:</p>
<p><strong>Session#1 (March 3</strong><span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;"><strong>rd</strong></span><strong>)</strong>: non-redundant and redundant (from server connectivity perspective) layer-3 fabrics. The <em>redundant server connectivity </em>part is further split into MLAG- and active/standby scenarios.</p>
<p>Design considerations include routing protocol selection, convergence speed optimization, addressing on core links, route summarization, ECMP or LAG, and BGP AS number selection.</p>
<p>Guest star: Dinesh Dutt (Cumulus Networks) will talk about Cumulus BGP implementation and how it simplifies fabric deployments, configuration and troubleshooting.</p>
<p><strong>Session#2 (March 29</strong><span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;"><strong>th</strong></span><strong>)</strong>:  Host routing (propagating host routes across layer-3-only fabric) and routing on hosts.</p>
<p>Design considerations include forwarding table sizes and routing protocol selection.</p>
<p>Guest star: Dinesh Dutt (Cumulus Networks) explaining their <strong>redistribute arp </strong>functionality and running BGP across unnumbered layer-3 server-to-network links.</p>
<p class="info">Beyond the second session the details are still a bit sketchy as we’re still working on the content. More to follow in the second update…</p>
<p><strong>Session#3 (April 6</strong><span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;"><strong>th</strong></span><strong>)</strong>: Layer-2 fabrics, including MLAG-based solutions, routing-on-layer-2 solutions (TRILL, SPB) and overlay fabrics (VXLAN). Details to follow…</p>
<p>Guest star: Kulin Shah (Arista) describing Arista’s VXLAN implementation, including leaf switch auto-provisioning, VARP, and routing with VXLAN. </p>
<p>You might have noticed that Kulin’s topics include mixed layer-2+3 scenarios, which we’ll cover in <strong>Session#4 (</strong><strong>April 20</strong><span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;"><strong>th</strong></span><strong>)</strong> with guest star Lukas Krattiger (Cisco) speaking about Cisco’s VXLAN+EVPN implementation.</p>
<p>Finally, there might be <strong>Session#5 (TBD)</strong> talking about external connectivity and load balancing across the fabric.</p>
