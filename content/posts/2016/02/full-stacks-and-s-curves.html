<p>Here’s another interesting coincidence:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>A few days ago I listened to excellent <a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org/2016/02/03/full-stack-journey-ep002/">Full Stack Journey podcast with Scott Lowe and Matt Oswalt</a> in which they discussed how some engineers fear moving into adjacent technologies because they would have to (yet again) start from scratch;</li>
<li>This morning I was cleaning up some old presentations and stumbled upon a diagram I’ve “never seen before” (in the middle of a presentation I created – how’s that for reliable memory) which led me to an <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/09/throw-your-life-a-curve/">interesting article explaining how we have to jump into unknown territories</a> to retain the thrill we get from mastering new skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>Homework for today: listen to the podcast, read the article, and start exploring some new technology (<a href="https://www.ipspace.net/NetAutSol">network automation</a> immediately comes to mind).</p>
