<p>Julian Lucek did a fantastic job describing how <a href="/2015/10/optimizing-traffic-engineering-with.html">NorthStar controller uses BGP-LS and PCEP</a>, so I asked him whether he’d be willing to do a deep dive on these two topics. He gracefully agreed, and the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=PCEP">results are already online</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>As expected, he started with the introductions: <a href="http://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/PCEP/1%20-%20Introduction.mp4">why would we need BGP-LS and PCEP</a> and how do they fit into the bigger picture.</p>
