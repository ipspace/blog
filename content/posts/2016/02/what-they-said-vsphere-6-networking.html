<p>One of the engineers watching the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/VSphere_6_Networking_Deep_Dive">vSphere 6 Networking Deep Dive</a> found it particularly useful:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">There were pearls of knowledge in there which expanded my understanding of ESX and gave me more than a few "aha!" moments […] The course is worth the money and time for sections "uplink redundancy &amp; load balancing" and "VLAN based virtual networks" alone.</blockquote>
