<p>I spent most of last year developing <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Roadmap/SDN_and_OpenFlow_webinars">SDN-related content</a>, resulting in <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/09/the-autumn-cloudsdn-roadtrip.html">pretty successful</a> <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN,_OpenFlow_and_NFV_Workshop">2-day workshop</a> and 20+ hours of online content. However, I fully agree with Matt Oswalt that <a href="https://keepingitclassless.net/2016/01/sdn-network-automation-splitting-hairs/">network automation matters even more than lofty centralized ideas</a>, so it was time to focus on that area.</p>
<p>As always, the easiest way to push yourself is to commit to a deadline, so I agreed to do a <a href="https://www.troopers.de/events/troopers16/584_hands-on_network_automation/">network automation workshop</a> during the <a href="https://www.troopers.de/troopers16/">Troopers 16 event</a>. Here&#x2019;s what it will cover:<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Introduction to network automation</strong> &ndash; what is it, why should we use it, and what tools are available if you want to get started.</p>
<p><strong>Hierarchy of network needs</strong> based on an excellent post by <a href="http://packetlife.net/">Jeremy Stretch</a>. We&#x2019;ll start with how we can improve the operations of existing networks, how you can slowly introduce abstracted network state, use it for automated network provisioning, and finally what can be done in the area of automatic remediation.</p>
<p><strong>Network automation tools</strong> &ndash; when and how would you use Puppet, Ansible, Git, Gerrit and Jenkins.</p>
<p>After the introductory section we&#x2019;ll focus on one of the most common entry-level automation tasks: <strong>generating and deploying device configurations</strong> using tools better than Excel and Putty. After describing the big picture we&#x2019;ll go deeper into:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Generating network state data models and encoding them in YAML;</li>
<li>Using Jinja2 to generate network device configurations;</li>
<li>Using Ansible for network automation.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Ansible section we&#x2019;ll explore a few other rabbit trails, including:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Executing commands on network devices and getting usable data back from them;</li>
<li>Pushing configurations into devices using SCP and NAPALM.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we&#x2019;ll briefly visit <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/06/netconf-expect-on-steroids.html">NETCONF</a>, see what it&#x2019;s all about, what YANG is, and whether they are useful in network automation scenarios.</p>
<p>Interested? There are only a few places left, so hurry up and <a href="https://www.troopers.de/troopers16/registration/profile/">register ASAP</a>.</p>
