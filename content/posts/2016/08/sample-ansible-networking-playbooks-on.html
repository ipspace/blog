<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>I spent the last week creating numerous scenarios using Ansible networking modules for my upcoming <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Hands-On_Network_Automation">Network Automation workshop</a>. The scenarios use Cisco IOS and Nexus OS modules as I used VIRL for network simulation, but you could easily adapt them to other networking devices.</p>
<p>All the scenarios I’m covering in the workshop are available in my <a href="https://github.com/ipspace/NetOpsWorkshop">Github repository</a>; to get the them explained you’ll have to <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Hands-On_Network_Automation">attend the workshop</a>. Enjoy!</p>
