<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>One of my subscribers considered attending the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Virtual_Firewalls_Workshop">Virtual Firewalls workshop</a> on September 1<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">st</span> and asked:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Would it make sense to attend the workshop? How is it different from the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Virtual_Firewalls">Virtual Firewalls</a> webinar? Will it be recorded?</blockquote>
<p>The last answer is easy: No. Now for the other two.<!--more--></p>
<p>The crucial difference between the webinar and the workshop is the focus:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>The webinar focuses on virtual firewall technologies and integration with the rest of the virtualized environment;</li>
<li>The workshop focuses on those parts of design, deployment and operational aspects that are impossible to cover in one-way communication.</li>
</ul>
<p>More specifically, weâ€™ll focus on these questions and try to find better answers than <em>It depends</em>:</p>
<ul><li>Do you need a stateful firewall in every case or would a packet filter be good enough?</li>
<li>How stateful should the firewall/packet filter be?</li>
<li>Where do we need physical firewalls, and where could we use virtual ones?</li>
<li>Can we replace firewall HA with vSphere HA?</li>
<li>Virtual firewall placement in leaf-and-spine fabric</li>
<li>Service insertion and/or chaining</li>
<li>Changing security paradigm with microsegmentation</li>
<li>Do we need traditional firewalls if we have microsegmentation?</li>
<li>Does it make sense to use traditional firewalls on every virtualization host?</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if you want to learn about the technology, watch the webinar. If you want to participate in a design/deployment discussion and exchange ideas with fellow networking and security engineers, <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Virtual_Firewalls_Workshop">register for the workshop</a>.</p>
<p class="info">Needless to say, the workshop participants get access to the webinar materials a few days before the workshop to help them prepare for the whiteboard discussions.</p>
