<p>I stumbled upon a <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&amp;id=2953944">great ACM article</a> comparing challenges of distributed systems with well-known milestones of modern physics.</p>
<p>The modern networks are probably the ultimate distributed systems. Now take the ideas from that article and apply them to the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/05/does-centralized-control-plane-make.html">Centralized Control Plane</a> concept (the last time I <a href="https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/sdn-definition">checked</a> the marketers were still <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/11/the-numerous-levels-of-sdn-reality.html">promoting that academic marvel</a>).</p>
