<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>After the fantastic <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Docker">Docker 101</a> webinar by Matt Oswalt a few people approached me saying “<em>that was great, but we’d need something more on Docker networking</em>”, and during one of my frequent chats with Dinesh Dutt he mentioned that he already had the slides covering that topic.</p>
<p>Problem solved… and Dinesh decided to do it as a free webinar (thank you!), so all you have to do is <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Docker_Networking_Fundamentals">register</a>. Hurry up, there are only 1000 places left ;)</p>
