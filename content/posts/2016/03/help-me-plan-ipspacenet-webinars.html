title: Help Me Plan ipSpace.net Webinars

<p>I had a sweet problem with ipSpace.net webinars for quite a while: there are way more ideas than available time. However, a few days ago I stumbled upon a <a href="http://blog.trello.com/going-public-roadmapping-with-a-public-trello-board/">great tip on Trello blog</a> and immediately decided to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: <a href="https://trello.com/b/9LhRHSsv/">list of future ipSpace.net webinars</a> as a Trello board.<!--more--></p>
<p>Some webinars are already scheduled, for others I have the content almost ready. Some webinars are in planning phase, which means there’s a pretty high probability they’ll eventually happen, and finally there are some that are still in the <em>let’s contemplate that </em>phase.</p>
<p>I enabled voting and commenting for this board, which means that you can vote for a webinar (or more of them) or add suggestions or comments… as long as you have a valid Trello account, which you can easily link to your Google account.</p>
<p>Finally, if you have other ideas that are not on the board yet, do write a comment or send me an email.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to your feedback!</p>
