title: I’m New to SDN. Where Should I Start?

<p>One of my readers sent me this question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Considering I know nothing about anything SDN-related (and considering it seems "SDN" means something different depending to whom you are asking), where should someone with no knowledge of SDN start?</blockquote>
<p>The obvious answer: <a href="http://sdn.ipspace.net">sdn.ipSpace.net</a>. On a more serious note:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>You might want to start with the question <em>“What is SDN?”, </em>or <em>“which definition of SDN makes sense?”</em>, so the obvious starting point would be the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN101"><em>Introduction to SDN</em></a><em> </em>webinar (free thanks to sponsors NIL Data Communications and NEC).</li>
<li>You can also get that same webinar bundled with a few others into <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_SDN"><em>Introduction to SDN, NFV and Network Automation</em></a><em> </em>(also free).</li>
<li>Once you’re ready for heavier topics, explore the paid <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Roadmap/SDN_and_OpenFlow_webinars">SDN</a> and <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Roadmap/Network_Automation_webinars">network automation</a> webinars. You can buy individual webinars, whole tracks, or get access to all of them with <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">ipSpace.net subscription</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is that all?</strong> No, obviously there are plenty of other resources on the Internet, but unfortunately most of them preach the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/11/the-numerous-levels-of-sdn-reality.html">centralized control plane</a> religion (which <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/05/does-centralized-control-plane-make.html">makes little sense</a>). However, if you found something more agnostic, please write a comment, and I’ll add a <em>List of resources </em>to my SDN page.</p>
<p class="more">Interestingly, it was pretty easy to do that for <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6">IPv6</a>, but then that technology can buy a beer even in most restrictive countries these days.</p>
