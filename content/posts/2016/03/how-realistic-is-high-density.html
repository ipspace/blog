title: How Realistic Is High-Density Virtualization?

<p>A while ago I <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/08/how-big-is-big-private-cloud.html">guestimated that most private clouds don’t have more than a few thousand VMs</a>, and that they <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/09/how-much-data-center-bandwidth-do-you.html">don’t need more bandwidth</a> than what <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/10/all-you-need-are-two-top-of-rack.html">two ToR switches could provide</a>.</p>
<p>Last autumn <a href="http://virtual-red-dot.info/iwan-rahabok/">Iwan Rahabok</a> published a <a href="http://virtual-red-dot.info/1000-vm-per-rack-is-the-new-minimum/">blog post describing the compute- and storage parts of it</a>, and I had a <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/All%20You%20Need%20Are%20Two%20Switches.pdf">presentation describing the networking aspects of high-density consolidation</a>. However… <!--more-->whenever I was talking about the high-density virtualization I wondered how realistic that scenario is in a typical enterprise environment, and you know how hard it is to get a reliable set of data points that have more statistical significance than anecdata.</p>
<p>The situation changed dramatically when <a href="http://frankdenneman.nl/about-2/">Frank Denneman</a> from <a href="http://pernixdata.com/">PernixData</a> started publishing the results collected with their <a href="http://pernixdata.com/pernixdata-architect-software">PernixData Architect</a> product. So far he published:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Statistics about <a href="http://frankdenneman.nl/2015/12/23/insights-into-cpu-and-memory-configuration-of-esxi-hosts/">CPU and memory configurations of real-life ESXi hosts</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://frankdenneman.nl/2016/02/15/insights-into-vm-density/">VM density statistics</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you massage that data right, you get the conclusions I was looking for:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Plenty of deployments have enough CPU cores and memory for high-density virtualization;</li>
<li>A lot of people have high VM density on two-socket servers, and predictably the percentage increases with the number of cores.</li>
</ul>
<p class="info">On the other hand, it’s interesting to see that while ~15% of 24-core hosts have more than 100 VMs, almost 20% of those hosts run less than 10 VMs.</p>
<p>On a slightly tangential topic, I ran the presentation I mentioned above as a short webinar for my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">subscribers</a>, and the resulting videos are <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/BCloud#Content">already available</a> in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Designing_Private_Cloud_Infrastructure">Designing Private Cloud Infrastructure</a> webinar.</p>
