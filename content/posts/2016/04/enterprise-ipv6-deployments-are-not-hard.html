<p><a href="http://luka.manojlovic.net/">Luka Manojlovič</a>, a networking engineer with strong focus on Windows and IPv6 sent me a short status update on an enterprise IPv6 deployment:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Moved a whole enterprise network (central location + 17 remote locations) to dual-stack today. So far everything works.</blockquote>
<p>While that sounds pretty easy, there was a lot of work going on behind the scenes. Here are some of the highlights:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Configuring static IPv6 addresses and turning off DHCPv6 clients on Windows servers;</li>
<li>Adding IPv6 address pools to Windows DHCP servers and configuring DHCPv6 relays on remote routers;</li>
<li>Tweaking RA advertisements on all routers (and layer-3 switches for readers <a href="/2012/08/is-layer-3-switch-more-than-router.html">speaking marketese</a>) to stop SLAAC and advertise presence of DHCPv6 information.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">Obviously, his approach works as flawlessly as it does because he didn’t have to deal with the SLAAC-or-die religion embedded in Android.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: deploying IPv6 in an enterprise network is not Mission Impossible.</p>
<p>On the other hand, do keep in mind that Luka focused on practical aspects of IPv6 for years, so don’t expect to replicate his feat without significant investment in training, testing and piloting. </p>
<p>As always, you can either <em>build </em>the expertise or <em>buy </em>it (hire an expert), and while buying might be more expensive, it will definitely be faster and less error-prone. Not that I would expect some IT managers to heed this advice.</p>
