<p>Russ White wrote a <a href="http://ntwrk.guru/writing-books/">great response</a> to my “<a href="/2016/03/do-you-really-want-to-write-that-book.html"><em>Do You Really Want to Write that Book?</em></a>” blog post and I couldn’t agree more with what he wrote. Unfortunately, he seems to be a bit over-idealistic when analyzing why the market for high-end content is so small.</p>
<p>You know I usually have a cynical explanation handy, so here it is: too many people calling themselves <em>engineers </em>for no particular reason simply don’t care. It’s way easier to Google-and-paste your way around than to invest time in <a href="/2015/03/you-must-understand-fundamentals-to-be.html">understanding the fundamentals</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p class="info">I understand that you won’t devote days to studying technologies underlying a simple problem that you have to solve once in a lifetime, but if you encounter the same challenge multiple times, it’s time to do some proper research.</p>
<p>The problem with the <a href="/2008/12/random-scenic-route-certification.html">scenic route to knowledge</a> is that you have to invest an extraordinary amount of time before reaping the benefits (see also: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">10K hour theories</a>), but once you do, the results tend to be great.</p>
<p>For example, it’s <a href="/2015/03/response-why-technology-still-matters.html">really easy to identify the problems</a> with most things touted as SDN once you’ve seen (and understood) <a href="/2015/10/the-lack-of-historic-knowledge-is-so.html">enough networking technologies</a> – there are only so many ways a problem can be solved, and I haven’t seen a revolutionary one in decades (regardless of what the <a href="/2014/01/what-exactly-is-sdn-and-does-it-make.html">marketers</a> trying to separate VCs from their money <a href="/2013/11/two-and-half-years-after-openflow-debut.html">claim</a>).</p>
<p><strong>To summarize</strong>: Don’t be one of the people interested in finding shortcuts (aka <a href="/2011/08/road-to-complex-designs-is-paved-with.html">Best Practices</a>) without understanding them. Whenever you’re trying to grasp a new technology ask simple questions like:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>WHAT problem is it trying to solve?</li>
<li>HOW does it work (as opposed to How do I configure it)?</li>
<li>WHY does it work the way it does?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Before you leave</strong>: If you made it this far, you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJo5Jk9IdQA">MUST watch the excellent <em>A Praise for Hackers</em></a> Troopers 2016 keynote by Rodrigo Branco.</p>
<p><strong>And finally</strong>: if you prefer watching videos over reading books, <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/bin/bom/overview">here’s a treasure trove</a> of 130 hours of downloadable videos.</p>
