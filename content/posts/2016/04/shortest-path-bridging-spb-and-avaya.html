title: Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) and Avaya Fabric on Software Gone Wild

<p>A few months ago I met a number of great engineers from Avaya and they explained to me how they creatively use Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) to create layer-2, layer-3, L2VPN, L3VPN and even IP Multicast fabrics â€“ it was clearly time for another deep dive into SPB.</p>
<p>It took me a while to meet again with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roger-lapuh-41080a">Roger Lapuh</a>, but finally we started exploring the intricacies of SPB, and even compared it to MPLS for engineers more familiar with MPLS/VPN.
