<p>During one of my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Hands-On_Network_Automation">Network Automation</a> workshops one of the attendees said: “<em>Why are you using open-source software? It’s so poorly documented and impossible to set up.</em>” </p>
<p>I totally understood what he was trying to say (I’ve seen too many examples of <em>just read the code </em>approach), but fortunately there are still people who understand the value of documentation.<!--more--></p>
<p>For starters, Jinja2 and Ansible (the tools I use during hands-on parts of the workshop) have pretty good documentation, and sometimes you get totally surprised by what you see on GitHub. I’ll give you just two recent examples:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><a href="https://github.com/alexandergall/ALX">Layer-2 VPN Snabb Switch extension</a> by Alex Gall;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/experimental/vlan-networks.md">Macvlan and ipvlan modules for Docker</a> by Brent Salisbury. </li>
</ul>
<p>So it <strong>is </strong>possible to have well-documented open-source software assuming the author(s) of the software actually care about their users (and no, I will not start another rant about people spending time on <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/10/we-need-product-documentation-not-just.html">glitzy demos </a> instead of writing usable documentation).</p>
<p>Finally, for some choice comments on other less-documented parts of open source landscape, enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oebqlzblfyo">this talk by Artur Bergman</a>.</p>
