<p>I got an interesting question from one of my readers:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">If every device talking to a centralized control plane uses an out-of-band channel to talk to the OpenFlow controller, isn’t this a scaling concern?</blockquote>
<p>A year or so ago I would have said <strong>NO </strong>(arguing that the $0.02 CPU found in most networking devices is too slow to overload a controller or reasonably-fast <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/12/control-plane-in-openflow-networks.html">control-plane network</a>).<!--more--></p>
<p>In the meantime, the last generations of data center switches got decent CPUs (even multi-core ones) and way more bandwidth between forwarding ASICs and CPUs, so the control-plane network overload might be a real consideration. Still, we’re probably far away from the point where 1GE-per-device control-plane network would become a bottleneck.</p>
<p>Well-designed solutions that use <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/03/controller-based-packet-forwarding-in.html">proactive flow setups</a>exchange small amounts of information between an OpenFlow switch and a controller. On the other hand, if your controller sets up flows in response to unknown traffic punted to the controller (reactive mode), you’ll face so many <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/2.1%20-%20Centralized%20Control%20Plane.mp4">scalability challenges</a> that you won’t even notice the potential bandwidth limitations of the control-plane network.</p>
<p>This does not mean that you can ignore the problem though. Some <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/10/what-exactly-is-control-plane.html">control-plane traffic</a> has to be <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/06/implementing-control-plane-protocols.html">sent to the controller</a> and represents a nice attack vector that can be used to bring down the switch or even the controller without proper control-plane policing.</p>
<p class="warn">Most vendors offering OpenFlow-enabled switches haven’t even considered control-plane policing of <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/03/controller-based-packet-forwarding-in.html">punted OpenFlow traffic</a>. Cisco is the only exception I found so far; if I’ve missed something, please write a comment.</p>
<p>Finally, you might be concerned with the controller scalability. Building scale-out controller architecture where each controller instance controls a subset of the network is a well-understood problem that is relatively easy to solve if you’re OK with eventual consistency across the controller cluster, but then your controller-based network won’t behave any different from classical networks, so why bother. </p>
<p>A shipping example of this architecture is VMware NSX, and I’m not aware of any other OpenFlow-based controller that would have the same functionality – if you know more, please send me an email.</p>
