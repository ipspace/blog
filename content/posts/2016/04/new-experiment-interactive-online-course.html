<p>After I told you that I’m not going to Interop, I got numerous emails along the lines of “<em>but I was really looking forward to attending your workshop</em>” so I started looking for a solution that would combine the best of online and classroom worlds.</p>
<p>Here’s my first attempt: an <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">interactive online course</a> combining topics from two of my Interop workshops. I’m still working on the detailed agenda and plan to have it ready around May 1<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">st</span>. In the meantime, I’d really appreciate your feedback – leave a comment or send me an email.</p>
