<p>I always wondered why it’s so hard to accept that someone might not find your preferred solution beautiful but would call it complex or even harmful (or from the other side, why someone could not possibly appreciate the beauty of your design)… and then stumbled upon <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/2017/02/05/sam-harris-induces-cognitive-dissonance-in-ben/">this blog post</a> by Scott Adams describing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a> (the actual topic they’re discussing in the mentioned video doesn’t matter – look for the irrational behavior).</p>
<p>You might say “<em>but we could politely agree to disagree</em>” but unfortunately that implies that at least one of us is not fully rational due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aumann%27s_agreement_theorem">Aumann’s Agreement Theorem</a>.</p>
