<p>BGP is the kitchen-sink of networking protocols, right? Whatever control-plane information you need to transport around, you can do it with BGPâ€¦ <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/bgp-battleships">including the battleship coordinates</a> carried in BGP communities.</p>
<p>On the more serious front, it's nice to see at least some ISPs still care enough about the stability of the global Internet to use BGP route flap dampening.</p>
