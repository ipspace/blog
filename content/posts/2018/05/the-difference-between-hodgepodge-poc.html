<p>A friend of mine who had the unfortunate “pleasure” of being exposed to one of the open-source controller platforms sent me this after reading my <a href="/2018/01/bgp-route-selection-failure-of-intent/">snarky take</a> on <em>bragging about what you’re doing at Something-Open-Something-Something </em>conferences.<!--more--></p>
<hr/><p>This made me chuckle. I've got sick and tired of someone doing something as a proof-of-concept then bragging about it. When you start digging, you realize it's a bunch of shell scripts, Python code to mend other run time problems and a pile of luck when it comes to the goldilocks solution versioning issue (just the right code level for just the right scenario) &lt; My porridge is just the right temperature Mama bear!!</p>
<p>Whilst the dubbed "BGP tie breakers" are sometimes ugly, they are a well understood pot of gun powder and when used properly are effective. At least we know what the order is and how they work. I'm not sure I want to learn different flavors of proprietary intent based decision making software. We haven't even covered ML yet or the impact that could have.</p>
<p>Someone quite famous in the ML world who deals with networking said during a project proposal to a bunch of academics "<em>You really want to put (an equivalent of) a three-year-old at the controls of this thing?</em>"</p>
