<p>Tom Limoncelli wrote a <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&amp;id=3197520">great article about starting an automation journey</a> from sysadmin perspective. Not surprisingly, his recommendations aren’t that far off from what I’m telling networking engineers in my <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/bin/pdf?id=Network%20Automation%20101%20SINOG%203%20Keynote.pdf">network automation presentations</a>, <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Network_Automation_101">Network Automation 101</a> webinar, and <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutSol&amp;module=1">introductory part</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><strong>Document what you’re doing</strong>. I usually add “<em>try to simplify what you’re doing so you won’t be automating the existing mess</em>”</li>
<li><strong>Create automation equivalents</strong> for your manual steps (I call this part “<em>easy wins</em>” or “<em>picking the low-hanging fruit</em>”)</li>
<li><strong>Create automation</strong> out of automated steps – at this point you should start thinking about data models, system architecture, and testing and deployment procedures</li>
<li><strong>Self-service portals</strong> – once you’ve automated the manual steps, integrate your tool with larger systems and give it a self-service portal. In networking world, you’d have to start thinking about IPAM/CMDB integration.</li>
<li><strong>Discipline</strong> – once you start the automation journey, never turn back. Even if you have to do one-offs automate them – because one-offs usually happen more than once.</li>
</ul>
<p>As expected, the main automation benefit Tom points out isn’t cost reduction or similar nonsense but:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Consistency</li>
<li>Democratization of work – an interesting way of saying “because you automated things, more people can work on the problem using your tools”</li>
<li>Accelerating future work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you don’t care about automation I’d strongly recommend you <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&amp;id=3197520">read the whole article</a>, and if you need help getting something similar done in your network check out the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course – hundreds of networking engineers found it extremely helpful with many of them creating <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/03/presentation-and-video-real-life.html">inspiring production-grade solutions</a>.</p>
