<p>David Barroso was sick-and-tired of using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> of Network Automation and decided to create an alternative with similar functionality but a proper programming language instead of YAML dictionaries masquerading as one. The result: <a href="https://github.com/nornir-automation/nornir">Nornir</a>, an interesting network automation tool formerly known as Brigade we discussed in <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_90-Brigade.mp3">Episode 90</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a>.<!--more--></p>
<div class="update">2018-05-30: Brigade was renamed to Nornir. As David wrote me: “<em>just right after the podcast was published we got contacted by Microsoft engineers as they already had a quite popular Kubernetes automation tool called brigade as well so we decided to change the name of the project.</em>”</div>
