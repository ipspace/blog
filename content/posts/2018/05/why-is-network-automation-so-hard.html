title: Why is Network Automation So Hard?

<p><em>This blog post was initially sent to the subscribers of my SDN and Network Automation mailing list. </em><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscribe/Five_SDN_Tips"><em>Subscribe here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Every now and then someone asks me “<em>Why are we making so little progress on network automation? Why does it seem so hard?</em>”</p>
<p>There are some obvious reasons:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/09/controller-cluster-is-single-failure.html">Tightly-coupled components</a> and <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/04/on-sdn-controllers-interconnectedness.html">humongous blast radius</a>;</li>
<li>Lack of good tools and <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2017/10/cli-or-api-again-and-again-and-again.html">programming interfaces</a>;</li>
<li>Lack of transactional consistency (in some cases even <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/10/network-automation-rfp-requirements.html">simple commits</a>);</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there’s a bigger elephant in the room: every network is a unique snowflake.<!--more--></p>
<p>You can buy dozens of network management products, download numerous open source tools, and yet you won’t be a single step closer to offering service-level abstraction of your network to your users because it’s impossible to develop a tool that will cater to the idiosyncrasies of every single network designed by an engineer with <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/08/temper-your-macgyver-streak.html">MacGyver mentality</a> (because the needs of his company couldn’t possibly be identical to the needs of hundreds of similar businesses around him). It’s thus impossible to develop a simple network automation tool (similar to vCenter or System Center) that would cater to the needs of mid-range market.</p>
<p>The best you could do today is to go down SAP route: develop a highly customizable tool (example: Cisco NSO) and deploy an army of consultants that will customize the tool to the specific needs of the target network – a fantastic undertaking if you happen to be the consultant, a pretty good fit for a service provider looking to fully automate their services, but not exactly what a reasonably-sized organization that needs a network to support its business might be looking for.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can build your own solution with low-level tools like Ansible, and integrate it with an off-the-shelf or custom-built orchestration system. Should you wish to do gown this route, you might find the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> course highly useful.</p>
<p>Or you could give up, say “<em>automation is not for me</em>” and keep doing random mistakes because you’re sick-and-tired of menial work. Before deciding giving up is the right thing to do, please <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2018/05/worth-reading-manual-work-is-bug.html">read this</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things won’t change for the better until we give up the “<a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/02/we-need-to-move-from-assembling-car.html">car parts</a>” mentality and start deploying cookie-cutter networks based on a standard design. Products like Cisco’s ACI fabric are definitely the step in the right direction… until the reality intervenes and clutters a clean design with legacy integration options.</p>
