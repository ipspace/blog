<p>When the Spring 2018 <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course started, we didn’t know whether we’d run another course in 2018, so we offered engineers who wanted to get an early start <em>Believer </em>price.</p>
<p>The wait is over: the autumn 2018 course starts on September 18<sup>th</sup>. The <a href="http://automation.ipspace.net/Public:Live_sessions">schedule of the live sessions</a> is already online, and we also have the first guest speakers. We’ll announce them in early June at which time you will no longer be able to get the <em>Enthusiast </em>price, so <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions#register">register ASAP</a>.</p>
