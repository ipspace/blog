<p>As part of his “<a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DCFabric#AVAYA">how does Avaya implement data center fabrics</a>” presentation, Roger Lapuh talked about <a href="http://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/DCFabric/M82 - Interesting Fabric Use Cases - Avaya.mp4">use cases for SPB in data center fabrics</a>.</p>
<p>I have no idea what Extreme decided to do with the numerous data center fabric solutions they bought in the last few years, so the video might have just a historic value at this point… but it’s still nice to see what you can do with smart engineering.</p>
