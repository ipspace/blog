title: Who’s Pushing Layer-2 VPN Services?

<p>Here’s another great point <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiziano-tofoni-1361759/">Tiziano Tofoni</a> raised in his comment to my <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2018/02/using-evpn-in-very-small-data-center.html">EVPN in small data center fabrics</a> blog post: </p>
<blockquote class="cite">I cannot understand the usefulness of L2 services. I think that the preference for L2 services has its origin in the enterprise world (pushed by well known $vendors) while ISPs tend to work at Layer 3 (L3) only, even if they are urged to offer L2 services by their customers.</blockquote>
<p>Some (but not all) ISPs are really good at offering IP transport services with fixed endpoints. Some Service Providers are good at offering per-tenant IP routing services required by MPLS/VPN, but unfortunately many of them simply don’t have the skills needed to integrate with enterprise routing environments.<!--more--></p>
<p>For example: I’ve seen MPLS/VPN providers who force the customers to accept external OSPF routes because the provider wants to own the CE-router and is not willing to do BGP-to-OSPF redistribution in a way that would preserve the OSPF route attributes the way they were meant to be preserved in MPLS/VPN architecture.</p>
<p class="info">More about this can of worms in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Choose_the_Optimal_VPN_Service">Choose the Optimal VPN Service</a> webinar and <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Integrating_Internet_VPN_with_MPLS_VPN_WAN">Integrating DMVPN-based Internet VPN with MPLS/VPN WAN</a> case study. Both are included in <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">ipSpace.net webinar subscription</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Long story short</strong>: I always believed in greatness of MPLS/VPN architecture, but when the theory meets reality things often get ugly. As much as it hurts me, I’d prefer buying layer-2 services or IP transport services from a service provider because I know they can’t mess them up too much, and I’d still own the end-to-end routing. </p>
<p>I would then use the layer-2 transport service to build my own routed core, or use IP transport service with a tunnel VPN on top of it. You could also use SD-WAN if you’re happy to deal with GUI-driven undocumented technologies.</p>
