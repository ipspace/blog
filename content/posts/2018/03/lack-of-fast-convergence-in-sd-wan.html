<p>One of my readers sent me this question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I'm in the process of researching SD-WAN solutions and have hit upon what I believe is a consistent deficiency across most of the current SD-WAN/SDx offerings.  The standard "best practice" seems to be 60/180 BGP timers between the SD-WAN hub and the network core or WAN edge. </blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, he wasn’t able to find BFD in these products either. </p>
<p>Does that matter? My reader thinks it does:<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite">When we consider that many companies will use these SD-WAN solutions to transport voice and real-time traffic, why is there a lack of focus on mechanisms which enable fast convergence at critical aggregation points?</blockquote>
<p>He definitely has a point, even without voice and real-time traffic requirements. Waiting three minutes to figure out an adjacent box is down definitely feels like a call from ‘90s.</p>
<p>Or maybe we’re missing something. The whole idea of SD-WAN was to take over the core WAN routing in your network. Tom Hollingsworth has an interesting story<a href="https://networkingnerd.net/2018/01/19/can-routing-be-oversimplified/"> in one of his blog posts</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">We turned off OSPF and now have a /16 route for the internal network and a default route to the Internet where a lot of our workloads were moved into the cloud.</blockquote>
<p>We’ve seen similar claims in the past. Remember MPLS/VPN and the nirvana you’ll reach once the Service Provider takes over your core routing? Yeah, it didn’t turn out exactly that way, did it?</p>
<p>Anyway, assuming we give a proprietary black-box system with no publicly-accessible documentation total control of our core network should we care about the routing protocols at the edge of the black haze?</p>
<p class="info">SilverPeak and Viptela are notable exceptions: <a href="https://www.silver-peak.com/support/user-documentation">SilverPeak documentation</a>, <a href="https://docs.viptela.com/Product_Documentation">Viptela documentation</a>. Anyone else? Write a comment!</p>
<p>If you’re deploying a single SD-WAN appliance per site, and it controls all uplinks, the answer is obviously NO. There’s a single exit point (SD-WAN appliance) and it’s either working or not.</p>

<p>If you’re deploying redundant SD-WAN appliances on a site that needs higher availability and these appliances work as a cluster, control all the uplinks, and use layer-2 tricks (usually VRRP) to give the impression of a single next-hop router to the site network, the answer is still NO. We’re doing the same thing with static default routes pointing to a shared IP address of a firewall cluster today. I’m not saying it’s a good idea, but some people would probably claim it’s the best practice.</p>

<p>Unfortunately some SD-WAN vendors believe they can use the same approach no matter what. Their appliances try to avoid routing protocols like black plague and use dirty tricks like VRRP between SD-WAN appliance and on-site router combined with static default routing to get the appearance of primary/backup behavior. How many times do we have to repeat the same mistakes?</p>

<p>However, if you do run routing protocol between SD-WAN appliances and other routers on your site for whatever reason (failover, alternate uplinks…), then I guess we deserve a decent implementation of the said routing protocols. It’s not like you couldn’t get a routing protocol suite these days, either as open-source project or a commercial product.</p>

<p>Or maybe the SD-WAN vendors don’t have to care because they’re never asked about such mundane details. There must be plenty of customers believing in <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/09/long-distance-irf-fabric-works-best-in.html">magic powers of PowerPoint</a> out there…</p>
