<p>Continuing the <a href="/2018/01/packet-forwarding-on-linux-on-software/">Linux networking discussion we had in Episode 86</a>, we focused on Linux interfaces in <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_87-Linux_Network_Interfaces.mp3">Episode 87</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a> with Roopa Prabhu and David Ahern.</p>
<p>We started with simple questions like “<em>what is an interface</em>” and “<em>how do they get such weird names in some Linux distributions</em>” which quickly turned into a complex discussion about kernel objects and <strong>udev</strong>, and details of implementing logical interfaces that are associated with ASIC front-panel physical ports.<!--more--></p>
<p>Other topics we found interesting: </p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>What types of interfaces would you typically see?</li>
<li>How do you configure Linux interfaces?</li>
<li>How can you stack interfaces and which combinations make sense?</li>
<li>How would you use Linux interfaces to deal with VLANs and bridge domains?</li>
<li>The history of bridging and VLAN filtering in Linux, and scalability enhancements made to Linux bridge in recent years</li>
<li>Who is running Spanning Tree Protocol on a Linux bridge?</li>
<li>How are tunnel interfaces implemented in Linux, and what is the role of a tunnel interface driver?</li>
<li>What are lightweight tunnel interfaces and why do we need them to make MPLS on Linux scale?</li>
<li>How are the tunnel interfaces accelerated in hardware?</li>
<li>How multipoint VXLAN tunnels make Linux-based VXLAN implementations scalable</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds interesting? </p>
