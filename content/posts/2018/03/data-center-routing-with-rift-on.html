<p>Years ago Petr Lapukhov decided that it&rsquo;s a waste of time to try to make OSPF or IS-IS work in large-scale data center leaf-and-spine fabrics and figured out how to <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/02/using-bgp-in-data-center-fabrics.html">use BGP as a better IGP</a>. </p>
<p>In the meantime, old-time routing gurus started designing routing protocols targeting a specific environment: highly meshed leaf-and-spine fabrics. First in the list: Routing in Fat Trees (RIFT).<!--more--></p>
<p>In Software Gone Wild <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_88-RIFT.mp3">Episode 88</a> we sat down with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-tony-przygienda-018501">Dr. Tony Przygienda</a>, author of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-przygienda-rift-05">RIFT</a>, and Jeff Tantsura, chair of the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rift/about/">RIFT IETF working group</a>.</p>
<p>We started with tons of background topics: </p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Do we even have a problem?</li>
<li>Why is BGP not good enough, and why do we need another routing protocol?</li>
<li>What are the big players doing?</li>
<li>Why can&rsquo;t we use OSPF or IS-IS in large highly meshed fabrics?</li>
<li>Do we really need (transport) policies and traffic engineering in data centers, or is it better to buy more bandwidth?</li>
<li>Is it worth solving the problems in the network, or should they be solved on the hosts?</li>
</ul>
<p>After wasting 20 minutes on describing the problem we finally got to the interesting stuff: </p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>What is RIFT? What environments is it supposed to be working in?</li>
<li>How can you combine the benefits of link-state and distance-vector technologies in the same routing protocol?</li>
<li>How RIFT uses automatic deaggregation to avoid black holes caused by aggressive summarization</li>
<li>What has RIFT borrowed from other routing protocols and what&rsquo;s unique?</li>
<li>RIFT is schema-based (not TLV-based) protocol. What does it mean and why does it matter?</li>
<li>Why is RIFT running on top of UDP and not using a separate Ethertype like IS-IS</li>
<li>How is flooding implemented in RIFT and what are flooding scopes?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Why is directionality (east-west versus north-south)&nbsp;so important to RIFT?</li>
<li>What happens when your data center fabric has leaf-to-leaf shortcuts?</li>
<li>How does RIFT figure out the position of an individual&nbsp;switch (leaf or spine) within the fabric?</li>
<li>How can you use key-value store embedded in RIFT to implement zero-touch provisioning?</li>
</ul>
