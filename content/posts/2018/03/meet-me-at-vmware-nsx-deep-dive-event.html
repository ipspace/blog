title: Meet Me at VMware NSX Deep Dive Event in Zurich

<p>When VMware launched the first version of NSX for vSphere more than four years ago, the NSBU team reached out to me and asked me to create a sponsored webinar describing NSX fundamentals, its architecture, and high-level deployment guidelines.</p>
<p>In the meantime we discussed updating the materials, but nothing ever happened. Time to fix that, this time from a vendor-neutral perspective. We’ll start with a day-long event on April 19<sup>th</sup> 2018 in Zurich, Switzerland.<!--more--></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.sig-switzerland.ch/de/workshop-next-gen-infrastructure/">morning session</a> will focus on NSX fundamentals and use cases. I’ll talk about Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) principles and how you could streamline application deployment with NSX. After my brief introduction, Mitja Robas, an awesome data center expert with several production NSX deployments will share the lessons he learned the hard way. </p>
<p>The presentations will be followed by a roundtable discussion, giving you the opportunity to get any relevant information you might need from engineers with hands-on VMware NSX experience.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we’ll do a <a href="http://www.sig-switzerland.ch/de/digs-workshop-vmware-nsx/">deep dive into the VMware NSX for vSphere architecture and its components</a>, the way it implements layer-2 and layer-3 forwarding, the integration between virtual and physical networking, and the NSX layer 4-7 services, including microsegmentation, load balancing and firewalling.</p>
<p>Interested? There are only two things you have to do:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Register for the event: <a href="https://www.sig-switzerland.ch/de/sdn-workshop-reg-form1/">morning session</a>, <a href="https://www.sig-switzerland.ch/de/digs-workshop-reg-form1/">afternoon workshop</a>.</li>
<li>Plan your trip to Zurich ;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope we’ll have a chance to talk about VMware NSX, software-defined data centers, or any other exciting topic (during the breaks) on April 19<sup>th</sup>.</p>
