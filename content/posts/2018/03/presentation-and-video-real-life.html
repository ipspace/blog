<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>The networking engineers attending the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course created numerous amazing automation solutions, most of them already deployed in production networks.</p>
<p>I described some of them in my <a href="https://www.troopers.de/troopers18/agenda/c7ewqv/">Troopers 2018 Real-Life Automation Wins</a> talk. The <a href="http://content.ipspace.net/get/Real-Life%20Automation%20Wins.pdf">presentation is online</a> and the video has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNentN_zETk">published on YouTube</a> a few days ago. I hope you’ll find it as inspirational as the Troopers attendees did.</p>
<p>Did you create an awesome automation solution? I’d like to hear about it!</p>
