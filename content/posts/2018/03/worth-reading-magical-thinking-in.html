<p>Someone pointed me to <a href="https://www.farsightsecurity.com/2016/04/28/vixie-magicalthinking/">this article</a> by dr. Paul Vixie (of the DNS fame). The best part (as I’m not a security person):</p>
<blockquote class="cite">The TCO of new technology products and services, including security-related products and services, should be fudge-factored by at least 3X to account for the cost of reduced understanding. That extra 2X is a source of new spending: on training, on auditing, on staff growth and retention, on in-house integration.</blockquote>
<p>In case you didn’t get it: figure out how much you think the magic unicorn-based software-defined solution will cost, then multiply it by three. Of course nobody wants to admit that.</p>
