<p>Russ White wrote a <a href="https://rule11.tech/enterprise-versus-provider/">great article</a> along the lines of what <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/11/the-three-paths-of-enterprise-it.html">we discussed a while ago</a>. My favorite part:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">There are companies who consider the network an asset, and companies that consider the network a necessary evil.</blockquote>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>On a tangential topic: Russ will talk about network complexity in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">Building Next-Generation Data Center</a> online course starting on April 25<sup>th</sup>.</p>
