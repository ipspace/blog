<p>PowerShell started as a tool to automate Windows servers. It was picked up by VMware (and others) as a platform on which they built their own solutions (PowerCLI and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/02/video-what-is-powernsx.html">PowerNSX</a>)… but did you know you can use it to configure data center infrastructure, including NX-OS switches, SAN networks, and Cisco UCS?</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get?doc=460443aa-60dd-11e7-9ac8-005056880254">Configuring Data Center Devices with PowerShell</a> video, Mitja Robas described how to do that, and provided <a href="https://github.com/1mrobas/PowerShell-for-Networking-Engineers-20170213">source code</a> for all his examples.</p>
