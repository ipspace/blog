<p>Although it’s almost three months till the start of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">Building Next-Generation Data Center online course</a>, we already have most of the guest speakers. Today I’d like to introduce the first two (although they need no introduction).</p>
<p>You might have heard about Russ White. He was known as Mr. CCDE when that program started and recently focused more on data centers, <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Open_Networking_for_Large-Scale_Networks">open networking</a> and whitebox switching. He’s also an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Russ-White/e/B001IYVAHY">authority on good network design and architecture</a>, network complexity, and <a href="https://rule11.tech/havent-found-tradeoff/">tradeoffs you have to make</a> when designing a network.<!--more--></p>
<p>Russ already had a guest presentation covering various aspects of open networking in the data center course; this time I invited him to start the course with a presentation about network complexity and tradeoffs – a topic we conveniently ignore way too many times.</p>
<p>Remember Network Security Princess (aka MrsYisWhy), a security guru surviving <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/PCI_DSS_for_Engineers">PCI DSS nightmare</a> and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ending_the_Tyranny_of_Expensive_Security_Tools">using available tools instead of buying vendor snake oil</a>? She disappeared for a few years and emerged on a totally different planet focused on DevOps. She’ll talk about <a href="http://nextgendc.ipspace.net/Public:5-High-Availability_Concerns#Guest_Speaker">what she’s learned while being there</a> helping DevOps teams cope with traditional infrastructure and security engineers. </p>
<p>I’ve seen an early version of her presentation and I can promise a lively and controversy-filled hour ;)</p>
