<p>Gian Paolo Boarina wrote a blog post describing why it’s <a href="https://www.ifconfig.it/hugo/post/whiteboxes/">so ridiculous to see everyone excited</a> about the latest thing Netflix (or Google or Amazon or…) managed to pull off. Absolutely worth reading.</p>
<p>On a similar topic: did you notice that Google started <a href="https://thenewstack.io/beyondcorp-google-ditched-virtual-private-networking-internal-applications/">promoting clientless SSL VPN as the next great thing</a>? RFC 1925 anyone?</p>
