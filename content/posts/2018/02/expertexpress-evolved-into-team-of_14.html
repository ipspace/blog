<p>Years ago, I decided to try out another idea: solving real-life challenges with the help of an <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/ExpertExpress">easy-to-consume online consulting service</a>. When I discussed the idea with my friends during one of the early Networking Field Day events the opinion was pretty unanimous: “this will never work”</p>
<p>Fortunately, they were wrong. Not only did ~100 customers decided to use it in the meantime, the simple idea grew to a point where I couldn’t do it all on my own.<!--more--></p>
<p>Time for step#2 of the original masterplan: turn <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/ExpertExpress">ExpertExpress into a team of independent experts</a>. I asked several networking architects I knew for a very long time (and consequently trusted enough to recommend them unequivocally) whether they’d be interested in participating in this idea, and most of them enthusiastically agreed.</p>
<p>The end result: ExpertExpress is now a team of five CCIE/CCDE-level engineers with expertise in:</p>
<ul><li>Data center, campus and service provider networking;</li>
<li>Private, hybrid and public cloud deployments;</li>
<li>Virtualization, storage and SAN, including FC and FCoE</li>
<li>Security;</li>
<li>Network automation and SDN.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every member of the team is focusing on a different set of platforms or vendors; together we can solve problems involving:</p>
<ul><li>Networking devices running Cisco IOS, IOS-XR, NX-OS, ACI or Junos;</li>
<li>Virtualization environments running VMware, VMware NSX, and Hyper-V;</li>
<li>Automation tools including Ansible, Puppet, Chef, PowerShell and Cisco NSO.</li>
</ul>
