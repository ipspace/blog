<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielsulbaran/">Gabriel Sulbaran</a> decided to tackle a pretty challenging problem after watching my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible for Networking Engineers</a> webinar: configuring older Checkpoint firewalls.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I had no idea what Ansible was when I started your webinar, and now I already did a really simple but helpful playbook to automate changing the timezone and adding and deleting admin users in a Checkpoint firewall using the command and raw modules. Had to use those modules because there are no official Checkpoint module for the version I'm working on (R77.30).</blockquote>
<p>Did you automate something in your network? Let me know!</p>
