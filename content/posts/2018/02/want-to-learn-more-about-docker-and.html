title: Want to Learn More about Docker and Containers?

<p>One of my readers wanted to know more about containers and wondered how ipSpace.net materials could help him. Here’s a short step-by-step guide:</p>
<p class="info">I published this blog post to help <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">ipSpace.net subscribers</a> navigate through <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Docker">Docker- and containers-related material</a>. You might want to skip it if you’re not one of them.<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite">From quick service deployment perspective, are containers any different from spinning up virtual machines?</blockquote>
<p>I covered the fundamental (technology) differences between containers and virtual machines in <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DC30#COMPUTE">Server- and OS Virtualization</a> section of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_3.0_for_Networking_Engineers">Data Center for Networking Engineers</a> webinar.</p>
<p>If you want a glimpse of how things work: <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Author:Matt_Oswalt">Matt Oswalt</a> illustrated how easy it is to start a container or build an application stack with Docker Swarm and Docker Compose in his <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Docker">Introduction to Docker</a> webinar.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Author:Matthias_Luft">Matthias Luft</a> did a great job introducing Docker and DevOps concepts in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Docker_Security">Docker Security</a> and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/DevOps_and_Security_for_Enterprise_Environments">Devops and Security in Enterprise Environments</a> webinars.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Are there similar features in existence for containers such as vMotion, SRM etc</blockquote>
<p>The technology introduction in <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DC30#COMPUTE">Server- and OS Virtualization</a> section of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_3.0_for_Networking_Engineers">Data Center for Networking Engineers</a> webinar will tell you why you cannot do vMotion (or at least why it would be exceedingly hard to do).</p>
<p>You can get SRM-like behavior with Docker Swarm and Docker Compose. Matt explained some those concepts in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Docker">Introduction to Docker</a> webinar, and I did a few demos in the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DockerWS">Docker and Containers</a> workshop.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">What are key considerations from Dev Ops perspective to choose between different Container Orchestration Platforms</blockquote>
<p>Mathias covered that in a bit of detail, but not too much. He claims most his customers use Swarm, obviously you get a totally different message from Google or people partnering with them ;)</p>
<blockquote class="cite">And of course what are you recommendations for Network Engineers around stuff they should absolutely know about Containers and material they should go through.</blockquote>
<p>Apart from mastering the fundamentals (see above), you MUST watch the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DockerNet">Docker Networking</a> webinar by <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Author:Dinesh_Dutt">Dinesh Dutt</a>, and we <a href="/2018/01/webinar-plans-for-2018.html">plan to do a webinar on Kubernetes</a> in second half of 2018.</p>
