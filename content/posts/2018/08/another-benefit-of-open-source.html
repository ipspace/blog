<p>You probably know my opinion on <a href="/2015/08/musing-on-nerd-knobs.html">nerd knobs</a> and the <a href="/2018/04/is-ospf-unpredictable-or-just-unexpected.html">resulting complexity</a>, but sometimes you desperately need something to get the job done.</p>
<p>In traditional vendor-driven networking world, you might be able to persuade your vendor to implement the knob (you think) you need in 3 years by making it a mandatory requirement for a $10M purchase order. In open-source world you implement the knob, write the unit tests, and submit a pull request.<!--more--></p>
<p>This is exactly what <a href="http://blog.donatas.net/about/">Donatas Abraitis</a> did when he <a href="http://blog.donatas.net/blog/2018/07/27/frr-bgp-default-originate/">figured out FRR cannot set additional attributes on BGP default routes</a> and Russ White <a href="https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/pull/2755/commits/c2e10422033771da9f12a4a283b0bc767240a3d8">merged the patch into FRR master branch</a> last week. Problem solved.</p>
<p>Obviously not everyone has the necessary development skills, and it might not make sense to Google-and-stumble your way through the obstacle maze to get the functionality you need, but you can always engage consulting companies like <a href="https://www.igalia.com/">Igalia</a> like a <a href="/2016/03/x86-based-switching-at-ludicrous-speed.html">large ISP looking for high-performance NFV solutions did</a>.</p>
