<p>When I started the <em><a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">Building Next-Generation Data Centers</a></em> online course, I didn’t have the automated infrastructure to support it, so I had to go with the next best solution: a reasonably-flexible Content Management System, and Mediawiki turned out to be a pretty good option.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we developed a full-blown course support system, included guided self-paced study (available with most <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Courses">ipSpace.net online course</a>), and progress tracking. It was time to migrate the data center material into the same format.<!--more--></p>
<p>The first part of the migration is completed – the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NextGenDC&amp;module=1">introduction</a>, <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NextGenDC&amp;module=2">automation</a>, <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NextGenDC&amp;module=3">compute/virtualization</a> and <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NextGenDC&amp;module=4">storage infrastructure and protocols</a> sections are available in the new format, and the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NextGenDC">new course content page</a> points to the either the migrated sections, or the old material. We plan to migrate the rest of the material in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Feedback on the new format is obviously highly welcome. Thank you!</p>
