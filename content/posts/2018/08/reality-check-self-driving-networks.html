<p>I stumbled upon an article with an interesting title (and worth reading): <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/08/to-make-self-driving-cars-safe-we-also-need-better-roads-and-infrastructure">To Make Self-Driving Cars Safe, We Also Need Better Roads and Infrastructure</a>… and thought about the claims along the lines of “<em>if they managed to solve the self-driving cars challenge, it’s realistic to expect self-driving</em><em> networks</em>” made in <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/09/self-driving-networks-with-kireeti.html">Self-Driving Networks podcast episode</a>. Turns out the self-driving cars problem is far far away from being solved.<!--more--></p>
<p>Here are a few obvious truths from the article:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">The designers of self-driving systems simply cannot foresee every possible combination of conditions that will occur on the road. </blockquote>
<p>Likewise, it’s impossible to foresee every combination of features a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/08/temper-your-macgyver-streak.html">macho MacGyver</a> might try to <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/06/from-trenches-rampant-macgyver-ism.html">google-and-paste</a> to fix his broken design. Of course the solutions will get better in time:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Over time, learning will take place and the number of situations that systems cannot recognize will decrease. </blockquote>
<p>Absolutely true. The interesting AI problems (like image recognitions) have huge standardized learning sets that the researchers can use to test and train their algorithms, and companies working on self-driving cars invested into <a href="https://medium.com/waymo/waymo-reaches-5-million-self-driven-miles-61fba590fafe">millions of miles</a> driven in real-life conditions. How far along are we in creating learning sets for self-driving networks?</p>
<p>Finally, there’s the “slight” challenge of funding. How much are the Waymos of the world investing into self-driving cars, and how much do you think the networking vendors are investing into self-driving networks (apart from burning the marketing budget)?</p>
<p>As much as I love the concept of self-driving networks, I remain as skeptical as I was when we were recording the podcast that we’ll see a universal solution any time soon. You can make enormous progress with a small team (like what <a href="https://ripe71.ripe.net/archives/video/152/">Facebook described at RIPE71</a>), but there’s no substitute for hard work and understanding what infrastructure your business really needs.</p>
<p>As always, the choice is yours: take the blue pill and believe in a vendor-delivered silver bullet, or take the red pill and get your hands dirty. Hundreds of network engineers deciding to go down the red pill path took the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> course to get them started. Will you join them?</p>
