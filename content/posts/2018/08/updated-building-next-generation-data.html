<p>After fixing the Building Network Automation Solutions materials, I decided to tackle the next summer janitorial project: creating standard curriculum pages for <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">Building Next Generation Data Centers</a> online course and splitting it into more granular modules (the course is ~150 hours long, and some modules have more than 40 hours of self-study materials).<!--more--></p>
<p>Step#1 is completed: I created new pages for individual live session (<a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=xNGDC16">autumn 2016</a>, <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=xNGDC17">spring 2017</a>, <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=xNGDC18">spring 2018</a>) and used those pages in <a href="https://nextgendc.ipspace.net/Public:Recordings_of_live_sessions">list of live session recordings</a> and <a href="https://nextgendc.ipspace.net/Public:Description">detailed course description</a>.</p>
<p>Step #2: create curriculum pages for self-study materials for individual modules.</p>
<p><em>During the </em><a href="/2018/06/time-for-summer-break/"><em>summer break</em></a><em>, I’m publishing blog posts about the projects I’m working on – as you can see, they include web site maintenance and other janitorial tasks. Regular blog posts will return in autumn.</em></p>
