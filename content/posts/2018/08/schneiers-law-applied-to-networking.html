<p>A while ago I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/04/schneiers_law.html">Schneier’s law</a> (must-read):</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Any person can invent a security system so clever that she or he can't think of how to break it.</blockquote>
<p>I’m pretty sure there’s a networking equivalent:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Any person can create a clever network design that is so complex that she or he can't figure out how it will fail in production.</blockquote>
<p>I know I’ve been there with my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/04/is-ospf-unpredictable-or-just-unexpected.html">early OSPF network designs</a>.</p>
