<p>Tom Hollingsworth published a <a href="https://networkingnerd.net/2018/08/17/the-cargo-cult-of-google-tools/">great blog post</a> summarizing <a href="https://vimeo.com/284394698">Cloud Field Day presentation by Ben Sigelman</a>. </p>
<p>TL&amp;DR: You’re not Google, you don’t have their problems, and so you’re probably not a good match for their tools.</p>
<p>While this shouldn’t come as a surprise to regular readers of my blog (here’s what I <a href="/2016/03/you-want-your-network-to-be-like/">wrote on the topic in 2016</a>), it’s refreshing to see it spelled out so eloquently (and by an ex-Googler).</p>
