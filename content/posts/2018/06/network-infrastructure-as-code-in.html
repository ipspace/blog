title: Network Infrastructure as Code in Network Automation Online Course

<p>In mid-May, I ran an onsite <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Hands-On_Network_Automation">network automation workshop</a>, and the manager organizing the workshop for his team invited me to a dinner with his peers. Not surprisingly, they wanted to hear about the topics covered in the workshop, and as soon as I mentioned Network-Infrastructure-as-Code several of them said “<em>yes, that definitely needs to be covered.</em>”<!--more--></p>
<p>Infrastructure-as-Code (and its networking equivalent), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code">usually defined</a> as “<em>process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools</em>”, is one of the great ideas that should help us work faster and more reliable… but it’s hard to find anything solid on network-infrastructure-as-code beyond generic blog posts and vendor marketing.</p>
<p>We’ll try to fix that in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course – Mark Prior described how he’s <a href="http://automation.ipspace.net/Public:7-Network_Infrastructure_as_Code">using these concepts to manage networking infrastructure in a private cloud deployment</a> in Spring 2018 session, <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Author:David_Barroso">David Barroso described similar ideas in his presentations</a>, and I’ll expand on the topic in the Autumn 2018 session of the automation course. </p>
<p>All you have to do to learn more about this interesting concept is to <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions#register">register for the course</a> and start learning about the <a href="http://automation.ipspace.net/Public:Description">basics of network automation</a> ASAP so you’ll have the necessary knowledge to discuss the details and ask pointed questions in September.</p>
<p><em>During the </em><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/06/time-for-summer-break.html"><em>summer break</em></a><em>, I’m publishing blog posts about the projects I’m working on. Regular blog posts will return in autumn.</em></p>
