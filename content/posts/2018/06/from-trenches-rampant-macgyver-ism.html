<p>Hereâ€™s a response I got from Simon Milhomme on my <em><a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2018/05/why-is-network-automation-so-hard.html">Why Is Network Automation So Hard</a></em> article:<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite"><p>I totally agree with you on all you're saying. I've been in the field of network engineering and a bit of system administration for quite some years and I've seen exactly what you're describing.</p>
<p>The snowflake factor and legacy ramification of the network makes it hard to automate, and make the MacGyver engineer look so clever and indispensable. </p>
<p>Medium-sized organizations I deal with are totally immature in terms of IT except if they make money out of IT. I mean, as long as IT is seen as a cost center, MacGyver will rule it, have fun and keep his reputation... glad to work long off hours just to prove he's worth what he's paid for. </p>
<p>So, unfortunately, I don't expect much automation for those... in fact, we have a hard time finding repetitive work to automate... because of... the snowflake network!</p>

<p>Let me conclude with a snarky sticker Lukas Krattiger sent me a while ago:</p>
