<p>This is the feedback I got from someone who used <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/ExpertExpress">ExpertExpress</a> to discuss the evolution of their data center:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">The session has greatly simplified what had appeared to be a complex and difficult undertaking for us. Great to get fresh ideas on how we could best approach our requirements and with the existing equipment we have. Very much looking forward to putting into practice what we discussed.</blockquote>
<p>And here’s what <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Expert:Nicola_Modena">Nicola Modena</a> (the expert working with the customer) replied:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">As I told you, the problem is usually to map the architectures and solutions that are found in books, whitepapers, and validated designs into customer’s own reality, then to divide the architecture into independent functional layers, and most importantly to always start from requirements and not technology.</blockquote>
<p>A really good summary of what ipSpace.net is all about ;) Thank you, Nicola!</p>
