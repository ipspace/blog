<p>A while ago I found an interesting analysis of <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/10/http2-issues.html">HTTP/2 behavior under adverse network conditions</a>. Not surprisingly:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">When there is packet loss on the network, congestion controls at the TCP layer will throttle the HTTP/2 streams that are multiplexed within fewer TCP connections. Additionally, because of TCP retry logic, packet loss affecting a single TCP connection will simultaneously impact several HTTP/2 streams while retries occur. In other words, head-of-line blocking has effectively moved from layer 7 of the network stack down to layer 4.</blockquote>
<p>What exactly did anyone expect? We discovered the same problems <a href="http://sites.inka.de/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html">running TCP/IP over SSH</a> a long while ago, but then too many people insist on <a href="/2018/05/video-spb-fabric-use-cases/#c8275029364481414673">ignoring history</a> and learning from their own experience.</p>
