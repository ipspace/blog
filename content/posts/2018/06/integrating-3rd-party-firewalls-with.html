<p>After figuring out how packet forwarding really works within AWS VPC (here’s an <a href="/2018/05/amazon-web-services-networking-overview/">overview</a>, the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=AWSNET">slide deck</a> is already available to <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">ipSpace.net subscribers</a>) the next obvious question should be: “<em>and how do I integrate a network services device like a next-generation firewall I have to use because $securityPolicy into that environment?</em>” </p>
<p class="note">Please don’t get me started on whether that makes sense, that’s a different discussion.</p>
