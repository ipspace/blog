<p>Here’s a question I got from an attendee of my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center"><em>Building Next-Generation Data Center</em></a><em> </em>online course:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">As far as I understood […] it is obsolete nowadays to build a new DC fabric with routing on the host using BGP, the proper way to go is to use IGP + SDN overlay. Is my understanding correct?</blockquote>
<p>Ignoring for the moment the fact that nothing is ever obsolete in IT, the right answer is <em>it depends</em>… this time on answer(s) to two seemingly simple questions “<em>what services are we offering</em><em>?</em>” and “<em>what </em><em>connectivity </em><em>problem are we trying to solve</em><em>?</em>”.<!--more--></p>
<p class="info">You can find plenty of material on the topic in <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NextGenDC&amp;module=1"><em>Define the Services and Requirements</em></a><em> </em>part of <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center"><em>Building Next-Generation Data Center</em></a><em> </em>online course. While you have to be enrolled in the course to access every single video in that module, some of them are accessible with <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">Standard ipSpace.net subscription</a>, and I included plenty of links to free resources.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the services.</p>
<p>Your data center infrastructure might have to support VM connectivity including on-demand virtual networks, BYOA (Bring Your Own Addresses), and IP mobility. These requirements were traditionally implemented with VLANs, requiring layer-2 fabrics using STP and/or MLAG, or fabric-side encapsulation into PBB or VXLAN. Large(r) deployments typically use hypervisor-side overlay virtual networking, resulting in the need for a single IP address per hypervisor host or per host uplink interface.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you might be providing connectivity for Docker containers that are hidden behind a single IP address (per host) or residing within an IP prefix advertised by the host – that’s how some ipvlan deployments work, and how Docker implemented IPv6 connectivity the last time I checked.</p>
<p class="info">Obviously you’d need more than just connectivity – every container solution implements some sort of traffic filtering to limit inter-container connectivity. ipSpace.net subscribers can find more details in <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Roadmap/Containers_and_Docker">Containers and Docker</a> webinars.</p>
<p>If you need a prefix per host (effectively <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/09/coming-full-circle-on-ipv6-address.html">reinventing CLNS</a>), running a routing protocol on the host is the most convenient thing to do… but what if you need a single IP address per host?</p>
<p>In the ideal world, every host uplink would have a different IP address belonging to a different subnet, and all we’d have to do on the infrastructure side would be to build a simple layer-3 fabric. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the hypervisor vendors still have problems spelling <em>networking </em>regardless of how much they talk about <em>software-defined networking</em>, and so every overlay virtual networking solution I’ve seen so far expects to have either a single IP address per host (reachable over multiple uplinks) or multiple IP addresses within the same subnet (yeah, like that’s an improvement).</p>
<p class="info">ipSpace.net subscribers can find way more details in <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/VMware_NSX_Technical_Deep_Dive">VMware NSX Technical Deep Dive</a> and <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Architectures">Leaf-and-Spine Fabrics</a> webinars; if you want to add interactive discussions and mentoring to your learning process, go for the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Designing_and_Building_Data_Center_Fabrics">Designing and Building Data Center Fabrics online course</a>.</p>
<p>The challenge we have to solve is thus <em>how do you tell the network it can reach the same IP address over multiple interfaces</em>? Two options that come to mind are LAG toward the host (requiring MLAG or equivalent between two ToR switches), or a routing protocol on the host advertising the overlay networking VTEP IP address as a host route to the network.</p>
<p>Now we know when having a routing protocol on the host makes sense. Next question: which one should you use? I’d <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/08/virtual-appliance-routing-network.html">never use OSPF or IS-IS</a> as they allow a misconfigured host to mess up the whole network. What’s left? RIP or BGP. I would go for BGP ;)</p>
<p class="info">Final tip: if you’re wondering what <em>equivalent of MLAG </em>might be, you’ll find the answers in <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics">Data Center Fabric Architectures</a> and <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/EVPN_Technical_Deep_Dive">EVPN Technical Deep</a> webinars.</p>
