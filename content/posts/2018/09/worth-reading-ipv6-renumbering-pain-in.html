<p><a href="https://twitter.com/webernetz">Johannes Weber</a> was forced to stress-test the <em>IPv6 networks are easy to renumber </em>nonsense and <a href="https://blog.webernetz.net/ipv6-renumbering-a-pain-in-the/">documented his test results</a> – a must-read for everyone deploying IPv6. </p>
<p>He found out that renumbering IPv6 in his lab required almost four times as many changes as renumbering (outside) IPv4 in the same lab.</p>
<p>My cynical take on that experience: “<em>Now that you’ve documented everything that needs to be changed, make sure it’s automated the next time ;)</em>”</p>
