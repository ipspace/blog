<p><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/09/network-automation-with-ansible-for.html">Last year’s experiment</a> generated so much interest that I decided to repeat it this year: if you’re an undergraduate or Master's student and manage to persuade us that you’re motivated enough to automate the **** out of everything, you’ll get a free seat in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible for Networking Engineers</a> online course. </p>
<p>Interested? <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Students/Ansible">Check out the details</a>, and apply before October 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>Too old? Please spread the word ;)</p>
