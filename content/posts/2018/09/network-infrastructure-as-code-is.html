title: Network Infrastructure as Code Is Nothing New

<p><em>Following “if you can’t explain it, you don’t understand it” mantra I decided to use blog posts to organize my ideas while preparing my Networking Infrastructure as Code presentation for the Autumn 2018 <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course. Constructive feedback is highly appreciated.</em></p>
<p>Let’s start with a simple terminology question: what exactly is <em>Infrastructure as Code </em>that everyone is raving about? Here’s what Wikipedia has to say on the topic:<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite">Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. […] The definitions may be in a version control system. It can use either scripts or declarative definitions, rather than manual processes, but the term is more often used to promote declarative approaches.</blockquote>
<p>You might wonder where all the other things are that the <em>Network Infrastructure as Code </em>(NIAC) evangelists are talking about like <em>automated testing, continuous integration, </em>and <em>continuous delivery. </em>Guess what: they’re not even mentioned. I’m not saying they’re not useful (they are – and we <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutSol&amp;module=5">already covered them</a> in the automation course), but they are not part of IaC concept.</p>
<p>Now let’s go back to the definition. Does “<em>managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable definition files</em>” sound familiar? </p>
<p>Are device configurations <em>definition files</em>? Of course – they define what the devices we’re applying them to should be doing. Are they <em>machine-readable</em>? Evidently. Does that mean that we had <em>network infrastructure as code </em>since the early days of Cisco software (even before it was called Cisco IOS)… or going even further, when we were still configuring IBM 3745 front-end processors? What do you think?</p>
<h4>A bit of historical trivia</h4><p>IBM 3745 ran <em>Network Control Program </em>operating system, and the configuration file was really a set of assembler macros that were compiled and linked with the rest of the operating system to get a bootable image. Changing device configuration required a reload… not unlike the way you had to do <em>configuration replace </em>on Nexus OS until software release 8.1.</p>
