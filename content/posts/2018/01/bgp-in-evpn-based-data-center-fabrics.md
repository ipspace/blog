EVPN is one of the major reasons we're seeing BGP used in small and mid-sized data center fabrics. In theory, EVPN is just a BGP address family and shouldn't impact your BGP design. However, suboptimal implementations might invalidate that assumption.

I\'ve described a few EVPN-related BGP gotchas in [BGP in EVPN-Based Data Center Fabrics](http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_BGP/BGP_in_EVPN-Based_Data_Center_Fabrics), a section of [Using BGP in Data Center Leaf-and-Spine Fabrics article](http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_BGP).

{{<note warn>}}Alex raised several valid points in his comments to this blog post. While they don't fundamentally change my view on the subject, they do warrant [a more nuanced explanation](/2018/04/bgp-in-evpn-based-data-center-fabrics/).{{</note>}}
