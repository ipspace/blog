<p>Most engineers talking about network automation focus on configuration management: keeping track of configuration changes, generating device configurations from data models and templates, and deploying configuration changes.</p>
<p>There’s another extremely important aspect of network automation that’s oft forgotten: automatic response to internal or external events. You could wait for <a href="/2017/09/self-driving-networks-with-kireeti.html">self-driving networks</a> to see it implemented, or learn how to do it yourself.<!--more--></p>
<p>On <a href="http://automation.ipspace.net/Public:Live_sessions">March 20th live session</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course <strong>David Gee</strong> will <a href="http://automation.ipspace.net/Public:4-Changing_Network_Configurations_or_State">dive deeper into event-driven network automation</a>. As he explains the challenge:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">When it comes to running infrastructure and infrastructure services, a lot of the decision making is human based. Someone reads a ticket, someone decides what to do. Someone gets alerted to an event and that someone does something about it. This involvement causes friction in the smooth-running nature of automated processes. Fear not! Something can be done about it.</blockquote>
<p>We all know the stories of ITIL and rigid process management and David will show you how event-driven automation could be made reality even with strict and rigid controls, resulting in an environment that reacts automatically to stimuli from your services and infrastructure. We will discuss what events are, when they're important, how to normalize them, and what we can do when we have identified an event positively. We will also discuss commercial vs open source options along with their pros and cons.</p>
<p>Finally, you will see a live demonstration of both syslog and ICMP powered event driven automation in action. Links to usable code samples will be provided in the session so you reproduce the demos in your own environment.</p>
