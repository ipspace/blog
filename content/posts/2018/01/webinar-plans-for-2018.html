<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>Last week I <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/01/webinars-in-2017.html">described what we did in 2017</a>. Now let’s see what the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">ipSpace.net subscribers</a> will get in 2018.</p>
<h4>New webinars</h4><p>I thought that <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/01/plans-for-2017.html">2017 would be a year of the cloud</a>, but that was not to be – I was too busy creating network automation and data center content.<!--more--></p>
<p>I plan to fix that in 2018, and do a series of cloud and Software-Defined Data Center (which is just a fancy name for private cloud) webinars covering <strong>VMware NSX</strong>, <strong>Cisco ACI</strong>, and <strong>AWS Networking</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>EVPN deep dive</strong> that I kept promising for quite a while is already scheduled, with the first session on March 6<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span>.</p>
<p>We might also do a deep dive into <strong>Kubernetes</strong> and a major overhaul of <strong>Docker webinars</strong> to cover the recent developments.</p>
<p>Finally, I’m getting tons of questions on data models, so I plan to do a webinar on <strong>Data Models and Data Stores</strong>.</p>
<h4>New Content in Existing Webinars</h4><p>The final chapters of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Architectures">Leaf-and-Spine Fabrics</a> saga are scheduled for March 29<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Network_Automation_Use_Cases">Network Automation Use Cases</a> webinar is getting new sections, starting with <strong>Intent-based Networking </strong>which might turn into an independent webinar if some of my more daring plans come through. More about this one a bit later.</p>
<p>We’ll add content describing individual open-source tools (starting with Git) to the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Network_Automation_Tools">Network Automation Tools</a> webinar.</p>
<h4>Refreshes and Updates</h4><p>I have tons of ideas about thing that could be improved, but only limited amount of time to do them. Anyway, here’s the full list:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Choose_the_optimal_VPN_service">Choose the Optimal VPN Service</a> is getting a total makeover in late January.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Interconnects">Data Center Interconnects</a> also needs it, and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Virtualized_Networking">Introduction to Virtual Networking</a> could benefit from another refresh.</li>
<li>I could talk more about distributed storage in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Designing_Private_Cloud_Infrastructure">Designing Private Cloud Infrastructure</a><strong> </strong>webinar.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Overlay_Virtual_Networking">Overlay Virtual Networking</a> needs an update of the hardware VTEP section, and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/VXLAN_Technical_Deep_Dive">VXLAN Deep Dive</a> needs more information on EVPN or a pointer to the EPVN webinar… my life became so much simpler when we <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/12/simplifying-ipspacenet-products.html">decided to stop offering individual products</a>.</li>
<li>It would be fun to add more <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN_Use_Cases">SDN use cases</a>, but I haven’t seen anything major appearing in the last 2 years. Have I missed an interesting new SDN use case? Please write a comment.</li>
</ul>
