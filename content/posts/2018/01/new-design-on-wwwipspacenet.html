<p>One of my readers sent me a polite email a while ago saying “<em>your site is becoming like $majorVendor’s web site – every corner looks completely different based on when you made it</em>”</p>
<div class="separator"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Pintando_la_favela_Santa_Marta..jpg/640px-Pintando_la_favela_Santa_Marta..jpg" style="max-width: 100%"/><br/><span style="font-size: 85%">Source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pintando_la_favela_Santa_Marta..jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></span></div>
<p>The worst part is that he was right, so I spent the last two weeks as a website janitor, mopping up broken markup, fixing CSS cracks, polishing old texts…<!--more--></p>
<p>The results of fixing several hundred web pages: all the <a href="/2017/12/simplifying-ipspacenet-products.html">product descriptions were cleaned up</a>, and the main web site got the new design that we started using on ipSpace.net blog a while ago. Along the way I also fixed the roadmaps, and made the free content easier to identify in every roadmap.</p>
<p>I probably missed something, and although my lovely marketing lady spent hours checking every nook and cranny of the web site there might still be errors lurking on less-visited pages. If you notice them, please send me an email or write a comment.</p>
<p>Finally, we’re still working on missing bits and pieces including:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Our <a href="https://strandrover.com/">fantastic designers</a> are still working on the new subscription page;</li>
<li>Including free presentations and videos in the list of free content (which will make the “free ipSpace.net content” site mostly obsolete);</li>
<li>Streamlining a few too-awkward workflows like registrations for live webinar sessions.</li>
</ul>
