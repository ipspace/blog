title: BGP in EVPN-Based Data Center Fabrics

<p>EVPN is one of the major reasons we’re seeing BGP used in small- and mid-sized data center fabrics. In theory, EVPN is just a BGP address family and shouldn’t have an impact on your BGP design. In practice, suboptimal implementations might invalidate that assumption.</p>
<p>I've described a few EVPN-related BGP gotchas in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_BGP/BGP_in_EVPN-Based_Data_Center_Fabrics">BGP in EVPN-Based Data Center Fabrics</a>, a section of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_BGP">Using BGP in Data Center Leaf-and-Spine Fabrics article</a>.</p>
<p class="warn">Alex raised a number of valid points in his comments to this blog post. While they don't fundamentally change my view on the subject, they do warrant a more nuanced description. Expect an updated version of this part of the article when I return from Cisco Live Europe</p>
