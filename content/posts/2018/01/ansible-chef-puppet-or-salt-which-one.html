title: Ansible, Chef, Puppet or Salt? Which One Should I Use?

<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>One of the first things I did when I started my deep-dive into <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Roadmap/Network_Automation_webinars">network automation topics</a> was to figure what tools people use to automate stuff and (on a pretty high level) what each one of these tools do.</p>
<p>You often hear about Ansible, Chef and Puppet when talking about network automation tools, with <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/04/salt-and-saltstack-on-software-gone-wild.html">Salt</a> becoming more popular, and CFEngine being occasionally mentioned. However, most network automation engineers prefer Ansible. Here are a few reasons.<!--more--></p>
<p class="note">Before you start writing a comment telling me how <em>everything</em> could be done with your favorite tool, which is theoretically true assuming your tool is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing-complete</a>, do consider that it’s also possible to <a href="http://digg.com/video/log-cabin-building-timelapse">build a hand-made log cabin</a> with a Swiss Army knife… but it might be a bit awkward and take a long time. OTOH, if I made a fundamental error of judgement, please do chime in.</p>
<p>As I explained in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Network_Automation_Tools">Network Automation Tools</a> webinar (also part of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible for Networking Engineers</a> and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online courses) Chef and Puppet focus mostly on configuration and state management: given the current and desired state of managed devices (including configuration), execute the changes needed to bring the current state to desired state. Both of them are <em>idempotent </em>(making no changes unless necessary) and can manage <em>dependencies </em>(for example: you have to create a group before creating accounts belonging to that group).</p>
<p>Managing configurations and soft state (active/disabled services) is great, but we need to do much more in networking. For example, I’ve seen Ansible used for device provisioning (breaking out of the Setup process), <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/04/network-automation-is-much-more-than.html">creating reports</a>, performing <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2017/06/how-do-i-start-automating-network.html">compliance checks</a>, <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2017/08/upgrade-network-device-software-with.html">upgrading software</a>, validating <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2017/10/create-network-diagram-from-lldp.html">networking topology</a>…</p>
<p>Also, Chef and Puppet take the <em>eventually we’ll get there somehow </em>path. It works great, but networking engineers prefer to have more control: we want to do <em>this one thing </em>at <em>this particular time</em>. Maybe it’s just our mentality, or maybe we have to do things a bit different because of the huge <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/09/schprokits-with-jeremy-schulman-on.html">blast radius</a> of our mistakes. In any case, Ansible (which is just a generic automation/orchestration framework) fits better to our way of doing things.</p>
<p>Everyone claims Ansible is simpler to master than Chef or Puppet (read also <a href="https://valdhaus.co/writings/ansible-vs-shell-scripts/">more explicit opinion</a>). I know you can get going in a few hours (and if you believe in Google-and-Paste here are a <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=AnsibleOC#SAMPLES">few sample playbooks to get you started</a>), but if you’re serious about becoming a network automation engineer it’s nonetheless worth investing some time into learning it properly. Ansible documentation is great, and there are tons of examples out there, but if you prefer a guided tour, do check out the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible for Networking Engineers</a> webinar or online course.</p>
<p>Finally, once you’re ready to move beyond simple automation and start working on full-blown solutions, it’s time to step back and look at the bigger picture. Yet again, you’ll probably get there on your own, or you could enroll into the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course. </p>
