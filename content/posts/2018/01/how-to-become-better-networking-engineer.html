title: How to Become a Better Networking Engineer
url: /2018/01/how-to-become-better-networking-engineer.html

<p>Got an interesting set of questions from one of my readers. He started with:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I really like networks but I don't know if I am doing enough for this community. Most of my work is involved with technologies which are already discovered by people and I am not really satisfied with it.</blockquote>
<p>Well, first you want to decide whether you want to be (primarily) a researcher (focusing on discovering new stuff), an engineer (mostly figuring out how to build useful things by using existing stuff), or an administrator (configuring stuff).<!--more--></p>
<p>The terminology used in IT in general and networking in particular is highly confusing. Most people calling themselves engineers are not doing anything remotely resembling engineering. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#Definition">this definition</a> and tell me what scientific principles we use in our jobs. It's mostly rule-of-thumb, best current practices, opinions, and vendor validated designs.</p>
<p>I can't comment on what the best way forward would be if you decide to become a researcher. Unfortunately I grew up in environment where academic research and reality didn't have too much in common, and decided to focus on things that produce real-life results. In the meantime I met numerous academic researchers that I highly respect because they're focusing on real-life problems. My favorite: the team from the University of Louvain (or wherever they are these days). Anyway, that train left the my station eons ago. On the other end of the spectrum, I also met academics that were selling snake oil to attract VC funding (SDN comes to mind), but that's a topic for another blog post.</p>
<p>In any case, there are tons of different mechanisms to contribute to the community:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Mentor younger engineers;</li>
<li>Educate non-networking professionals how networking really works;</li>
<li>Blog about your experiences (but make sure <a href="/2016/01/whatever-happened-to-do-no-harm.html">you’re technically accurate</a>);</li>
<li>Write documentation for open-source software;</li>
<li>Create or contribute to open-source software (it can be as little as one-line bugfix);</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="cite">However, I don't have any good ideas as well so I don't know what to do. I read articles and books on networking but I don't think that's the answer to become a better "network" engineer. How do you think I should go about this?</blockquote>
<p>There's a simple trick I used all my life: be curious. </p>
<p>Try to understand how things work - not only by reading books but by doing <a href="/2017/11/run-well-designed-experiments-to-learn.html">controlled experiments</a>.</p>
<p>Assuming the people creating things aren't stupid (which isn't always a given) and know what they’re doing (sometimes a questionable premise), try to figure out why they implemented them the way they did, and what trade-offs they had to make.</p>
<p>From your understanding of how things work, try to figure out how they'd behave in weird conditions. Validate that.</p>
<p>Ponder RFC 1925 Rule #8.</p>
<p>Assuming you have a pretty good understanding how a technology works, figure out the safest (or optimal or ...) way of using it. </p>
<p>Consider RFC 1925 Rule #12</p>
<p>There are always tradeoffs. If you haven't found them spend more time looking for them.</p>
<p>Time to think about RFC 1925 Rule 10.</p>
<p>Don't be clever. <a href="/2013/08/temper-your-macgyver-streak.html">MacGyver designs</a> inevitably result in network meltdowns. Also, you want to be able to go on holidays and not receiving a panicky call at 2 AM for a week or two.</p>
<p>Think some more about RFC 1925. Focus on Fundamental Truth #3.</p>
<p>Don't forget it's all about <a href="/2013/01/long-distance-vmotion-stretched-ha.html">solving real-life problem</a>. Although most of us work because we like technology, we still get paid because a business needs us.</p>
<p>Read RFC 1925 again. Contemplate Rule #1.</p>
<p>After a long while, you'll start seeing repeating patterns where everyone else thinks the unicorns are dancing with fairies. You reached the level of RFC 1925 Rule 11.</p>
<p>Finally, there's RFC 1925 Truth #4. Practice, practice, practice...</p>
