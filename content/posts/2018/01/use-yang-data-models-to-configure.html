title: Use YANG Data Models to Configure Network Device with Ansible

<p>It took years after NETCONF RFCs were published before IETF standardized <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6020">YANG</a>. It took another half-decade before they could agree on how to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7223">enable or disable an interface</a>, set interface description, or read interface counters. A few more years passed by, and finally some vendors implemented some of the IETF or OpenConfig YANG data models (with <a href="/2016/09/juniper-is-serious-about-openconfig-and.html">one notable exception</a>).</p>
<p>Now that we have the standardized structure, it’s easy to build automated multi-vendor networks, right? Not so fast…<!--more--></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rtripiana/">Ruben Tripiana</a> decided to <a href="https://github.com/rtripiana/bnas-project/tree/master/E04">use NETCONF and IETF or vendor-specific data models</a> in the <em>configure network devices</em> part of his <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> <a href="https://github.com/rtripiana/bnas-project">hands-on project</a>. Here’s a short summary of what he found out (and what I learned while chatting with him on the course Slack channel):</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>He used IETF data model to configure interfaces, and Cisco’s proprietary data model to enable BFD;</li>
<li>Similarly, he used IETF BGP data model to configure neighbors, and Cisco’s proprietary one to configure route maps.</li>
</ul>
<p class="info">Long story short: seamless multi-vendor network device configuration is still a pipe dream. You’re able to configure some aspects using standard data models, and have to use vendor’s data models (or text-based configuration) for the rest of your needs.</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Ansible has <strong>netconf_config</strong> module, which allows you to configure devices using XML documents, but not to read current configuration or operational data.</li>
<li>You have to pass valid XML document (text) to the <strong>netconf_config </strong>module. In the ideal world you’d get that XML document from some internal data structure. In real life you carefully craft it as a Jinja2 template.</li>
</ul>
<p>Isn’t this wonderful new automated world of NETCONF/YANG/APIs beautiful? Maybe it’s just me, but I see little difference from using Jinja2 templates to create vendor-specific text configurations.</p>
<p class="note">Before you write an angry comment telling me what an idiot I am – I’m all for multi-vendor interoperability, having a <a href="/2012/06/netconf-expect-on-steroids.html">standard way of receiving error messages from devices</a>, and using data models. However, based on past 30 years of experience in various areas of IT I remain highly skeptical about true multi-vendor data models. Also, what we can do today is almost no better than <a href="/2015/09/why-its-hard-to-deploy-sdn-like.html">what we’ve been doing a decade or two ago</a>.</p>
