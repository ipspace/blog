<p>Level3 had a pretty bad bad-hair-day just a day before <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutSol&amp;module=5#M5S3A">Pete Lumbis talked about Continuous Integration</a> on the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course (yes, it was a great lead-in for Pete).</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages-discussion/2017-November/001375.html">messages circulating on mailing lists</a> it was all caused by a fumbled configuration attempt. My wild guess: someone deleting the wrong route map, causing routes that should have been tagged with <strong>no-export </strong>escape into the wider Internet.<!--more--></p>
<p class="note">Please note I&rsquo;m not picking on Level3. It <a href="http://www.bailis.org/papers/partitions-queue2014.pdf">happens to everyone</a>, including the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/41926/">biggest players</a>.</p>
<p>As you probably know by now, there&rsquo;s only one way to minimize the number of fat-finger incidents: deploy tools and implement processes that minimize or reduce time spent typing in a SSH session. </p>
<p>If you have to rely on an operator doing copy-paste into a production box all the ITIL magic and change control and maintenance windows won&rsquo;t help you much&hellip; apart from slowing you down and occasionally reducing the impact of the blunders. After all, when was the last time you&rsquo;ve seen a rental car agent furiously typing in SQL statements to get you an upgrade?</p>
<p>Also, it might be a good idea to start thinking about the costs of doing exceptions. Either Level3 does everything by hand (hope not) or someone had to do a manual change because of a special customer. Straight from the report I quoted above:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">The issue was isolated to a policy change that was implemented to a single router in error while trying to configure an individual customer BGP.</blockquote>
<p>That customer definitely costed them a lot&hellip;</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">network automation online class</a>: some students are working on building automation solutions that will deploy IP routing protocols, MPLS fabric, L2VPN and L3VPN from service definition files, while others are <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2017/12/automate-remote-site-hardware-refresh.html">already deploying new WAN sites using automatically-generated configurations</a>.</p>
