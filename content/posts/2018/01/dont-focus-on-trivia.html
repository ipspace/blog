<p>Found this great quote in <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2FmDqup">Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions</a></em> - a must-read for all nerds:</p>
<blockquote class="cite"><p>Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Sherlock Holmes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now you know why you should focus on how things work instead of memorizing commands ;)</p>
