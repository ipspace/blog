<p>Remember the Software-Defined Data Centers hype? While I <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/SDDC">covered SDDC concepts and technologies</a> for years in my webinars and <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Workshops">workshops</a>, I never created an introductory webinar on the topic. </p>
<p>That omission has been fixed in late August – <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Software-Defined_Data_Center">SDDC 101</a> webinar is available as part of <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free">free subscription</a>, and as always I started with the seemingly simple question: <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/SDDC101/1%20-%20What%20Problem%20Are%20We%20Trying%20to%20Solve.mp4"><em>What problem are we trying to solve?</em></a></p>
