<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>Inspired by <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">The Zen of Python</a>, <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Dinesh_Dutt">Dinesh Dutt</a> wrote The Zen of Routing Protocols:</p>
<hr/><p>Beautiful is better than ugly.</p>
<p>Simple is better than complex.</p>
<p>Complex is better than complicated.</p>
<p>So just because you can, don't.<!--more--></p>
<p>One is better than many.</p>
<p>Unnumbered is better than numbered.</p>
<p>Readability counts.</p>
<p>Although practicality beats purity,</p>
<p>Automation should never be ignored.</p>
<p>An unused knob is sometimes better than a used.</p>
<p>Good enough network lasts longer than perfect.</p>
