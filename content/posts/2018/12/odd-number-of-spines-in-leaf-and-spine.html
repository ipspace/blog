title: Odd Number of Spines in Leaf-and-Spine Fabrics

<p>In the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/DCFabric/1%20-%20Market%20Overview.mp4">market overview</a> section of the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DCFabric#INTRO">introductory part</a> of <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics">data center fabric architectures</a> webinar I made a recommendation to use larger number of fixed-configuration spine switches instead of two chassis-based spines when building a medium-sized leaf-and-spine fabric, and explained the reasoning behind it (increased availability, reduced impact of spine failure).</p>
<p>One of the attendees wondered about the “right” number of spine switches – does it has to be four, or could you have three or five spines. In his words:<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite">Assuming that one can sufficiently cover the throughput/oversubscription plus resiliency/blast-radius requirements, is it fine to use an odd number of spines or would it be better to stick to an even number?</blockquote>
<p>Equal-cost multipathing (ECMP) is usually implemented with a fixed number of output buckets with multiple buckets mapped to the same next hop (I wrote about <a href="/2006/10/cef-load-sharing-details/">Cisco CEF implementation in 2006</a>). Some fields that are assumed to be a good representation of flow entropy are then extracted from each incoming packet, a hash value is computed from those fields, and that value selects the output bucket (and the next hop).</p>
<p class="info">Some ECMP implementations used just the destination IP addresses. A bit later source IP addresses were added to the mix to spread traffic toward the same host across multiple links. Today most implementations use the full 5-tuple (source/destination addresses/ports + protocol ID), and some vendors allow you to add additional fields like IPv6 flow label to support ideas like <a href="http://conferences2.sigcomm.org/co-next/2014/CoNEXT_papers/p149.pdf">FlowBender</a>.</p>
<p>If the software uses (approximately) the same number of buckets for each next hop you get ECMP, if it allocates more buckets to one next hop you get unequal-cost multipathing (like what we had with EIGRP variance or MPLS-TE over multiple tunnels).</p>
<p>Some ECMP implementations can use any number of buckets… but that complicates the hash function, so it’s common to see hardware implementations use powers of 2.</p>
<p>In the good old days when you could do ECMP across 8 or 16 output buckets it made sense to make the number of spines a power of two.</p>
<p>Today’s silicon has between 256 and 1024 ECMP buckets, so it shouldn’t matter anymore. Do all vendors implement that capability correctly? I have no idea… If you know more, please write a comment – I always love to hear about juicy real-life details like <a href="/2018/11/using-vxlan-and-evpn-to-build-active/#c7291036074622882430">IPv6 support in some EVPN implementations</a>.</p>
