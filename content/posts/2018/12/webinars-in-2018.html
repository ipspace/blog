<p>We wrapped up the 2018 webinars with Storage December featuring <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Hyper-Converged_Infrastructure_Deep_Dive">Hyper-Converged Infrastructure</a> with Howard Marks and <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/The_Network_Impact_of_NVMe_over_Fabrics_(NVMe-oF)">NVMe-over-Fabrics</a> with J Metz (I never thought I would enjoy storage technology discussions, but Howard and J were brilliant)… and this is what we’ve been doing the rest of the year:<!--more--></p>
