title: Can I Replace a Commercial Load Balancer with HAProxy?

<p>A networking engineer attending the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">Building Next-Generation Data Centers</a> online course sent me this question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">My client will migrate their data center, so they’re not interested in upgrading existing $vendor load balancers. Would HAProxy be a good alternative?</blockquote>
<p>As you might be facing a similar challenge, here’s what I told him:<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>TL&amp;DR</strong>: It depends.</p>
<p>First things first: HAProxy, nginx and Varnish are used in some very large production environments, and I will not even try to go into “<em>which one is better” </em>religious wars. </p>
<p>Performance doesn’t seem to be an issue. I’ve seen printouts from HAProxy environment running 250K concurrent TCP sessions on a single server, and there are people claiming to run 2M concurrent SSL sessions on HAProxy.</p>
<p>All three products offer commercial support, so that’s not an issue either.</p>
<p>Now for the interesting part…</p>
<p><strong>Some assembly required</strong>. Commercial load balancer (oops, <em>application delivery controller… </em>it sounds so much better) appliance is a black box that you can turn on and configure with high-level CLI or GUI.</p>
<p>Open-source products I mentioned are software packages that have to be installed on a Linux server. You need someone who can spell Linux without using Google to make it work… and please don’t try to hack your way through the Linux jungle with Google-and-Paste machete. Your business will thank you.</p>
<p>High-performance load balancing on Linux requires performance tuning, including kernel performance tuning. Yet again, you better have someone handy who did a similar job in the past… or you might discover the beauties of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oebqlzblfyo">full-stack awareness</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Featuritis</strong>. Commercial load balancers are full of features that the vendors tell you to use to solve all sorts of problems caused by <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/this-is-what-makes-networking-so-complex.html">craplications deployed in your data center</a>. Think crazy stickiness rules, changing TCP parameters left and right, doing all sorts of content manipulation. Not surprisingly, the more features you use, the happier the $vendors are – not only are you locking yourself into their platform, you also burn more CPU cycles on their boxes and thus need more expensive boxes.</p>
<p>The open-source software you plan to use might or might not have those features, so you have to:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Identify which features your current load balancer is using;</li>
<li>Figure out which one of these have a reasonable equivalent in the open-source software you’re considering;</li>
<li>Decide whether you can stop using the features that the open-source software doesn’t support.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Layer 7-9 reasons</strong>. A long while ago when Interop was in that brief interim phase when they really cared about education, I ran a workshop there and asked the audience <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/11/so-youre-open-source-shop-really.html">where they use open source software in their application stack</a>.</p>
<p>After the workshop an engineer approach me and told me that the only reason they’re not using open-source load balancers is legal: if the whole thing crashes, they want to have someone to sue, and to do that they have to buy a black box solution from a vendor. Welcome to reality.</p>
