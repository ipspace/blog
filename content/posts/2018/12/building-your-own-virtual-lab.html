title: Building Your Own Virtual Lab

<p>Last week we published <a href="/2018/12/using-virtual-labs-when-developing/">Matt Oswalt’s thoughts on using virtual labs in training and testing</a>. In the second part of his interview with <a href="http://uebermeister.com/about.html">Christoph Jaggi</a> he talked about building a virtual lab.</p>
<p class="info">Matt will cover the same topic in way more details in his <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions#MO19">guest speaker presentation</a> in Spring 2019 <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course. <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions#register">Register here</a>.<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite">What are the must<span>‐</span>haves if you want to build a reasonably large network topology in a virtual lab?</blockquote>
<p>Remember that virtual network devices are effectively appliances you run in a virtual machine, and the desired system requirements are usually fairly heavy. Many network operating systems require at least 4GB of RAM and 2 cores. If you’re looking to run a handful of devices, most modern laptops should support this.</p>
<p>However, for very complicated topologies, you’re going to quickly run out of available RAM. For this case, it might be better to either invest in a dedicated server with many more resources, or look at a hosted option like <a href="https://labs.networktocode.com/labs">Networktocode’s Labs</a>, or <a href="https://jlabs.juniper.net/ccl/">Juniper’s</a> <a href="https://jlabs.juniper.net/ccl/">Cloud CCL</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">How would a relative newbie build a virtual lab?</blockquote>
<p>I’d start small. The concepts of virtual machines and their connectivity don’t change too much between topologies of two nodes vs topologies of 20 nodes. Start with a tool like Vagrant, and search for your favorite vendor to publish Vagrantfiles containing prebuilt topologies that you can simply run with “vagrant up” and start a functional lab on your laptop. Once you have it all running, you can start to reverse engineer how its built and think about how you might customize it.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Which tools do you recommend for setting up a virtual lab?</blockquote>
<p>On the low<span>‐</span>end, Vagrant is a good tool for being able to easily spin up a simple lab topology on your laptop. If you want to dedicate some beefier hardware, tools like Wistar, GNS3, and EVE<span>‐</span>NG are good for simplifying the process of instantiating a virtual lab and ensuring a complex topology is connected in the right way. Finally, you can also pay for hosted options I already mentioned to take away the burden of maintaining the lab, so you can just focus on learning.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">How does a relative newbie best approach the use of a lab?</blockquote>
<p>Similar to a previous answer, start small, and first understand why you’re building a lab, whether it’s physical or virtual. Know what you’re trying to do, such as learning a specific platform or technology, or if you’re building some automation tooling and need a valid target to test against. Understand that no lab environment can perfectly mimic production, so also don’t view it as a panacea, or a replacement.</p>
