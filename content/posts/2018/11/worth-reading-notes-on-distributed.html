<p>I long while ago I stumbled upon an <a href="https://www.somethingsimilar.com/2013/01/14/notes-on-distributed-systems-for-young-bloods/">excellent resource</a> describing why distributed systems are hard (what I happened to be <a href="/2013/09/openflow-fabric-controllers-are-light/">claiming years ago</a> when OpenFlow was at the peak of the hype cycle ;)… lost it and found it again a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>If you want to understand why networking is hard (apart from the <a href="/2013/04/this-is-what-makes-networking-so-complex/">obvious MacGyver reasons</a>) read it several times; here are just a few points:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Distributed systems are hard because they fail more often;</li>
<li>Writing robust distribute systems costs more than writing robust single-machine system;</li>
<li>Coordination is hard;</li>
<li>Find ways to be partially available;</li>
</ul>
<p>The one thing I’d add to the list is “you have to deal with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance">byzantine failures</a>”.</p>
<p>Next time someone tells you “<em>networking engineers are so obtuse, we solved $whatever in some other domain in no time</em>” point him to this document… not that it would help, RFC 1925 rule 4 cannot be beaten.</p>
