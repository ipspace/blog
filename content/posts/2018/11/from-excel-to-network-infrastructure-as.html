<p>After a series of forward-looking podcast episodes we returned to real life and talked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carl-buchmann-6b436727/">Carl Buchmann</a> about his network automation journey, from managing upgrades with Excel and using Excel as the configuration consistency tool to network-infrastructure-as-code concepts he <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/02/automation-isnt-about-building-button.html">described in a guest blog post in February 2018</a><!--more--></p>
<p>Wonder what his intermediate steps were, why he decided to replace Excel with proper automation tools, why he believes everything you do should be stored in a Git repository, why you should use an editor with syntax highlighting, linting, and Git integrationâ€¦?
