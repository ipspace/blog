<p>I’m not the only one <a href="/2015/10/the-lack-of-historic-knowledge-is-so/">ranting</a> about the <a href="/2015/03/you-must-understand-fundamentals-to-be/">need</a> to get a <a href="/2015/03/too-many-details-can-hurt-you-or-why/">firm grasp</a> on <a href="/2015/03/you-must-understand-fundamentals-to-be/">fundamentals</a> before doing the sexy stuff. Found an <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/12/11/back-to-basics/">old blog post</a> by Joel Spolsky (of the <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">Law of Leaky Abstractions</a> fame) on the exact same topic from programming perspective.</p>
