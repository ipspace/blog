After a series of forward-looking podcast episodes we returned to real life and talked with [Carl Buchmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carl-buchmann-6b436727/) about his network automation journey, from managing upgrades with Excel and using Excel as the configuration consistency tool to network-infrastructure-as-code concepts he [described in a guest blog post in February 2018](https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/02/automation-isnt-about-building-button.html)

Wonder what his intermediate steps were, why he decided to replace Excel with proper automation tools, why he believes everything you do should be stored in a Git repository, why you should use an editor with syntax highlighting, linting, and Git integration...? Listen to [Episode 95](http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_95-Automation_Journey.mp3) of [Software Gone Wild](https://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild).
