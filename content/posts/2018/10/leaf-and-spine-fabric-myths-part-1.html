<p>Apart from the “<em>they have no clue what they’re talking about</em>” observation, Evil CCIE left a long list of leaf-and-spine fabric myths he encountered in the wild in a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/06/is-ebgp-really-better-than-ospf-in-leaf.html?showComment=1531903854342#c4430946733793890437">comment</a> on <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/06/is-ebgp-really-better-than-ospf-in-leaf.html">one of my blog posts</a>. He started with:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Clos fabric (aka Leaf And Spine fabric) is a non-blocking fabric</blockquote>
<p>That was obviously true in the days when Mr. Clos designed the voice switching solution that still bears his name. In the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clos_network">Clos network</a> every voice call would get a dedicated path across the fabric, and the number of voice calls supported by the fabric equaled the number of alternate end-to-end paths.<!--more--></p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/11/packet-and-flow-based-forwarding.html">packet switching networks</a> we have (at best) statistically non-blocking behavior – as long as no output port is congested, and the ECMP algorithm running on ingress switch does a perfect traffic distribution. Fat chance… for more details read at least the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/iigr-conga-distributed-congestion-aware-load-balancing-michael-orr/">TL&amp;DR version</a> of the <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/alizadeh/papers/conga-sigcomm14.pdf">CONGA article</a> (HT: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/boris-hassanov-7198793/">Boris Hassanov</a>).</p>
<p>What we do have today are <em>non-blocking switches</em>… but even that means nothing more than <em>the internal switching bandwidth is equal to the sum of external-facing bandwidth across all ports</em>. As soon as an output port is congested the switch cannot be non-blocking anymore.</p>
<p>But wait, there are the details that silicon vendors don’t want you to know (and thus they only <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/06/trident-2-chipset-and-nexus-9500.html">show you their hardware documentation after you sign NDA in blood</a>):</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Most switching silicon has 40GE or 100GE connections that are then split out into 10/25/50 GE front-panel ports. It seems that at least <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2016/05/what-are-problems-with-broadcom.html">some chipsets have head-of-line blocking challenges</a> across 25GE lanes of a single 100GE port.</li>
<li>Internal fabric bandwidth is just one of the parameters. Packet forwarding performance is another one… and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/05/how-line-rate-is-line-rate.html">not all silicon can do line-rate forwarding of small packets</a>.</li>
<li>Every single packet has metadata attached to it while traversing the internal (intra-switch) fabric as JR Rivers explained in the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Networks,_Buffers,_and_Drops">Networks, Buffers and Drops webinar</a> (available with <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free">free ipSpace.net subscription</a>). Some chipsets might struggle with the amount of bandwidth needed to transport both packets content and metadata across the internal fabric.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we usually build <em>oversubscribed </em>leaf-and-spine fabrics. The total amount of leaf-to-spine bandwidth is usually one third of the edge bandwidth. Leaf-and-spine fabrics are thus almost never non-blocking, but they do provide equidistant bandwidth.</p>
