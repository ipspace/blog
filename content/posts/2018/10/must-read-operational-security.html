<p>A team of IPv6 security experts I highly respect (including my good friends Enno Rey, Eric Vyncke and Merike Kaeo) put together a lengthy document describing <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-opsec-v6-13">security considerations for IPv6 networks</a>. The document is a 35-page <strong>overview </strong>of things you should know about IPv6 security, listing over a hundred relevant RFCs and other references.</p>
<p>No wonder enterprise IPv6 adoption is so slow â€“ we managed to make a total mess.</p>
