<p>Earlier this month I got this email from someone who had attended one of my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Courses">online courses</a> before and wanted to watch another one of them:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Is it possible for you to bundle a 1 year subscription at no extra cost if I purchase the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">Building Next-Generation Data Center</a> course?</blockquote>
<p>We were planning to do something along these lines for a long time, and his email was just what I needed to start a weekend-long hackathon. </p>
<p>End result: <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual">Expert ipSpace.net Subscription</a>. It includes:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Standard ipSpace.net subscription;</li>
<li>One self-paced online course of your choice (that you choose after buying the subscription).</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s also a <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Workgroup">team version of expert subscription</a> and we’re working on another bundle that will combine expert subscription with online consulting.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Self-paced online courses do not include live sessions;</li>
<li>Access to the online course materials is limited to the duration of your Expert subscription. </li>
</ul>
<p>After a year you could decide to:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Buy a new expert subscription and get access to another online course;</li>
<li>Renew standard subscription and keep access to ipSpace.net webinars (and the course Slack team – I hate cleanup jobs).</li>
</ul>
