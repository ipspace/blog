<p>Following on his previous work with Cisco ACI <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Dirk_Feldhaus">Dirk Feldhaus</a> decided to create an Ansible playbook that would <a href="https://github.com/somebody78/classic-env">create and configure a new tenant and provision a vSRX firewall for the tenant</a> when working on the <em>Create Network Services </em>hands-on exercise in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course.<!--more--></p>
<p>The most interesting part of his solution: the existing Ansible ACI modules didn’t provide all the functionality he needed to configure his tenants, so he had to create the data structure expected by a Cisco ACI REST API calls (create L3 external connection, create static port) with a Jinja2 template and use <strong>aci_rest </strong>module to execute them.</p>
<p>If you plan to make your Cisco ACI environment more consistent by automating common operations that would take dozens of (unreliable operator-driven) GUI clicks explore <a href="https://github.com/somebody78/classic-env">his solution</a> and adapt it to your needs… and if you need more information, <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=xNetAut183#ACI">watch his presentation</a> from autumn 2018 <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course.</p>
