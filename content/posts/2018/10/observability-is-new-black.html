<p>In early October I had a chat with Dinesh Dutt discussing the outline of the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Network_Observability">webinar he’ll do in November</a>. A few days later Fastly published a <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/monitoring-vs-observability">blog post on almost exactly the same topic</a>. Coincidence? Probably… but it does seem like <strong>observability </strong>is the next emerging buzzword, and Dinesh will try to put it into perspective answering these questions:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>What exactly is <em>observability</em>?</li>
<li>How is it different from monitoring?</li>
<li>Why does it matter?</li>
<li>When could modern technologies reduce observability, and what can you do to improve it?</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the webinar, Dinesh plans to introduce a new open source observability platform he’s been working on in the last months.</p>
<p>Here’s what you have to do if you want to join the live session:</p>
