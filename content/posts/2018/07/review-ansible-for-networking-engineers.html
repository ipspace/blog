<p>An engineer attending <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers">Ansible for Networking Engineers</a> online course sent me this feedback:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">This is a great place to learn Ansible and Network Automation from scratch. Starting with an emphasis on the fundamentals (YAML, JSON, Jinja2, how to group your network devices for automation, etc.) you progressively build up towards useful network automation. </blockquote>
<p>He particularly liked the additional features that are part of <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Courses">any ipSpace.net online course</a>:<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite">Most lessons are accompanied by questions and challenges, some of which require extra research which I find really solidify the understanding of what you're leaning. Finally, having access to their network automation Slack team is great. Even if you don't participate in the conversions, you can learn a lot just by reading through the conversations.</blockquote>
