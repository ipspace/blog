<p>It turns out that while I cannot bring myself to writing or creating other content during the summer break, it feels perfectly fine to be a janitor and fix small things on the web site.</p>
<p>One of the long-outstanding items: get rid of the <em>free content </em>web site that never went where I wanted it to go… one can do only so much in 24 hours. All the features available on content.ipspace.net are now part of the main ipSpace.net web site including <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Free">pointers to free content</a> and <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Presentations/List">list of free presentations</a>.</p>
<p><em>During the </em><a href="/2018/06/time-for-summer-break/"><em>summer break</em></a><em>, I’m publishing blog posts about the projects I’m working on. Regular blog posts will return in autumn.</em></p>
