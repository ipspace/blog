<p><em>Describe the differences between various ipSpace.net training options</em> has been on my to-do list for ages, but I successfully managed to ignore it till I deployed the new top-level menu that contains <em>training </em>category.</p>
<p>Our designers never considered menu items without a corresponding link, so I got an ugly mess that needed to be cleaned up either by fixing the CSS or writing the overview document.</p>
<p>End result: a high-level document <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Training">describing how ipSpace.net webinars, courses and workshops fit into the bigger picture</a>.</p>
<p><em>During the </em><a href="/2018/06/time-for-summer-break/"><em>summer break</em></a><em>, I’m publishing blog posts about the projects I’m working on. Regular blog posts will return in autumn.</em></p>
