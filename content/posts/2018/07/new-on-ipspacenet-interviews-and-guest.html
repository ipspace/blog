<p>You can find most of the interviews and guest podcasts I did in the last few years on <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Interviews">this web page</a> (also accessible as <em>Resources → Interviews</em> from the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/07/overview-of-ipspacenet-training-options.html">new menu</a>).</p>
<p><em>During the </em><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/06/time-for-summer-break.html"><em>summer break</em></a><em>, I’m publishing blog posts about the projects I’m working on – as you can see, they include web site maintenance and other janitorial tasks. Regular blog posts will return in autumn.</em></p>
