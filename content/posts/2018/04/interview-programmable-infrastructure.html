title: 'Interview: Programmable Infrastructure Is Just a Tool'

<p>A while ago I did an interview about programmable infrastructure that got <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/click/82c57c5e/3170/0000-0000-0000-0000-0000/1530">published as an article in mid-March</a>. As you might expect, my main message was “<em>technology will never save you unless you change your processes to adapt to its benefits</em>.”</p>
<p>Hope you’ll enjoy it!<br/></p>
