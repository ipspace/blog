<p>Bruno Wollman <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/03/dunning-kruger-in-it-infrastructure.html?showComment=1522102576480#c1565146020554007680">pointed me</a> to an <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2014/01/17/the-death-of-expertise/">excellent article on the ignorance of expertise</a> and confidence of the dumb. Here’s the TL&amp;DR summary (but you should really read the whole thing):</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg">The expert</a> isn’t always right;</li>
<li>An expert is far more likely to be right than you are;</li>
<li>Experts come in many flavors – usually you need a combination of education and expertise;</li>
<li>In any discussion, you have a positive obligation to learn at least enough to make the conversation possible. University of Google doesn’t count;</li>
<li>While you’re entitled to have an opinion, having a strong opinion isn’t the same as knowing something.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy ;)</p>
