Continuing the series of [data center routing protocol podcasts](https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/03/data-center-routing-with-rift-on.html), we sat down with Russ White (of the CCDE fame), author of another proposal: [OpenFabric](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-white-openfabric-05).

As always, we started with the "*what's wrong with what we have right now, like using BGP as a better IGP*" question, resulting in "*BGP is becoming the trash can of the Internet*".

You can probably guess the next set of intro questions: \"*Do we need policies and traffic engineering in a high-speed data center fabric?*"

Finally, we got to discussing OpenFabric, starting with how OpenFabric uses link-state database to modify IS-IS flooding behavior and thus reduces the total amount of flooding in a data center fabric. Next step: how do you know where it's safe to reduce flooding? You have to figure out whether you're a leaf or spine, and there are two ways in OpenFabric to solve that challenge.

Of course, we couldn't possibly stay on track, so there was a brief diversion into virtual aggregation, application-level IP address huggers and local area IP address mobility with ARP... but quickly got back to more OpenFabric goodness including how it uses [Segment Routing](http://www.ipspace.net/Segment_Routing_Introduction).
