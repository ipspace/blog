title: Should I Take CCIE DC or ipSpace.net Data Center Online Course?

<p>Got this question from a networking engineer who couldn’t decide whether to go for CCIE Data Center certification or attend my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">Building Next-Generation Data Center</a> online course:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I am considering pursuing CCIE DC. I found your Next-Generation DC course very interesting. Now I am bit confused trying to decide whether to start with CCIE DC first and then do your course.</blockquote>
<p>You might be in a similar position, so here’s what I told him.<!--more--></p>
<p>As always it depends… this time on what your immediate goals are.</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>If you want to achieve another certification, or become fluent in configuring and troubleshooting Cisco’s data center devices go for CCIE DC.</li>
<li>If you want to understand how to design and build data center infrastructure in real-life multi-vendor environment my data center course might be a better option.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like with any other CCIE track, you’ll learn tons of useful stuff while studying for CCIE DC, including technologies and fundamental principles that apply to every data center switching product (for example), but it will be (by necessity) Cisco-focused and influenced by their current product offering (= Nexus OS and Cisco ACI).</p>
<p>He also wondered whether there’s any overlap between the two:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Does the course Next-Generation DC cover Cisco switching and routing concepts? </blockquote>
<p>The course does cover technologies like data center fabric architectures, leaf-and-spine fabric designs, storage integration… but (apart from hardware and software overview) does not include any Cisco-specific information that would be targeted at individuals trying to pass CCIE DC exam.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that any CCIE exam is a configure-and-troubleshoot exam, while our data center online course focuses more on architectures and designs.</p>
<p>Sounds interesting? All you have to do is to <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center#register">register for the next session</a> starting on April 25<sup>th</sup>.</p>
