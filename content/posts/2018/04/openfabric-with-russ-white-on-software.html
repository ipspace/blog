<p>Continuing the series of <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2018/03/data-center-routing-with-rift-on.html">data center routing protocol podcasts</a>, we sat down with Russ White (of the CCDE fame), author of another proposal: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-white-openfabric-05">OpenFabric</a>.</p>
<p>As always, we started with the “<em>what’s wrong with what we have right now, like using BGP as a better IGP</em>” question, resulting in “<em>BGP is becoming the trash can of the Internet</em>”.<!--more--></p>
<p>You can probably guess the next set of intro questions: "<em>Do we need policies and traffic engineering in a high-speed data center fabric?</em>”</p>
<p>Finally, we got to discussing OpenFabric, starting with how OpenFabric uses link-state database to modify IS-IS flooding behavior and thus reduces the total amount of flooding in a data center fabric. Next step: how do you know where it’s safe to reduce flooding? You have to figure out whether you’re a leaf or spine, and there are two ways in OpenFabric to solve that challenge. </p>
<p>Of course, we couldn’t possibly stay on track, so there was a brief diversion into virtual aggregation, application-level IP address huggers and local area IP address mobility with ARP… but quickly got back to more OpenFabric goodness including how it uses <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Segment_Routing_Introduction">Segment Routing</a>.</p>
