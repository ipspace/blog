<p>My <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2018/01/bgp-in-evpn-based-data-center-fabrics.html">BGP in EVPN-Based Data Center Fabrics</a> blog post generated numerous comments from engineers disagreeing with my views on using IBGP-over-EBGP. </p>
<p>As usual, there were three kinds of comments:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>People like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grigorenkoae/">Alexander Grigorenko</a> arguing with the technical merits of what I wrote (Alex published a <a href="http://jncie.tech/2018/01/28/bgp-design-options-for-evpn-in-data-center-fabrics/">blog post describing his perspective</a>). They were right – I should have spent more time on the details;</li>
<li>People like Paul <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2018/01/bgp-in-evpn-based-data-center-fabrics.html?showComment=1521833306308#c5055854090187969717">saying</a> “while I understand your discussion, nothing else would work for my fabric”. Fair point – if you have to carry 1M prefixes around you cannot use generic design guidelines found on the Internet;</li>
<li>Anonymous commenters being annoyed because I called their baby ugly (more about this in another blog post).</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, Alex’ comments triggered a major rewrite of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_BGP/BGP_in_EVPN-Based_Data_Center_Fabrics">BGP in EVPN-Based Data Center Fabrics</a> section of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_BGP">Using BGP in Data Center Leaf-and-Spine Fabrics article</a>. It took me a long time to figure out how to structure it, and then more than a week ironing out the kinks based on feedback from people way closer to actual BGP source code than I ever was.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_BGP/BGP_in_EVPN-Based_Data_Center_Fabrics">new version of the document is online</a>. There are still a few missing bits and pieces, like route target implications of using numerous AS numbers in a single EVPN fabric, or performance differences between IBGP and EBGP-based EVPN designs.</p>
<p>For even more details, watch <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/EVPN_Technical_Deep_Dive"><em>EVPN Technical Deep Dive</em></a> and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Architectures"><em>Leaf and Spine Architectures</em></a> webinars (both part of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">ipSpace.net subscription</a>).</p>
