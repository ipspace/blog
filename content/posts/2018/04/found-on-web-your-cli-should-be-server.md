title: 'Found on the Web: Your CLI Should Be a Server'

Guess what I found: a software developer [trying to persuade his peers](https://hackernoon.com/your-cli-should-be-a-server-maybe-acf6a64be691) that they need an API version of their CLI tool. Yes, I checked and it's still 2018, and the year CLI dies seems to be a bit further out than [some people thought](https://networkingnerd.net/2018/02/09/the-winds-of-change-from-january/).

I'd guess this proves that the rest of the world is not so far ahead of us lowly network engineers as blabbering pundits and vendor marketers would have us believe.

Needless to say, the [engineers architecting Junos](https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/12/how-did-netconf-start-on-software-gone.html) knew this almost 20 years ago.
