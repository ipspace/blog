<p>Guess what I found: a software developer <a href="https://hackernoon.com/your-cli-should-be-a-server-maybe-acf6a64be691">trying to persuade his peers</a> that they need an API version of their CLI tool. Yes, I checked and it’s still 2018, and the year CLI dies seems to be a bit further out than <a href="https://networkingnerd.net/2018/02/09/the-winds-of-change-from-january/">some people thought</a>.</p>
<p>I’d guess this proves that the rest of the world is not so far ahead of us lowly network engineers as blabbering pundits and vendor marketers would have us believe.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2017/12/how-did-netconf-start-on-software-gone.html">engineers architecting Junos</a> knew this almost 20 years ago.</p>
