<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>I always love to read the practical advice by Andrew Lerner. Here’s <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2017/12/20/pragmatic-data-center-networking/">another gem</a> that matches what Brad Hedlund, Dinesh Dutt and myself (plus numerous others) have been saying for ages:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">One specific recommendation we make in the research is to “Build a rightsized physical infrastructure by using a leaf/spine design with fixed-form factor switches and 25/100G capable interfaces (that are reverse-compatible with 10G).” </blockquote>
<p>There’s a slight gotcha in that advice: it trades <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/04/should-we-use-redundant-supervisors.html">implicit complexity</a> of chassis switches with <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2017/06/leaf-and-spine-fabrics-implicit-or.html">explicit complexity</a> of fixed-form switches.<!--more--></p>
<p class="warn">The rest of the blog post contains links to ipSpace.net resources that you might find useful if you want to follow Andrew's advice and build a modular data center fabrics. You've been warned ;)</p>
<h4>Day 2 Operations</h4><p>While it’s perfectly possible to operate small fabrics as a CLI Jockey, once your fabric grows you’ll quickly appreciate <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutUC#CS_DC_FABRIC">any level of automation</a> you could get. At that point, you’ll have to decide whether to <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/11/can-you-afford-to-reformat-your-data.html">offload the complexity</a> back to the vendor, buy a <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2018/02/single-image-systems-or-automated.html">black-box solution from the same vendor</a>, buy an orchestration (oops, intent-based) system <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/01/lock-in-is-inevitable-get-used-to-it.html">from another vendor</a>, or build your own solution from smaller components.</p>
<h4>Master Modern Data Center Infrastructure</h4><p>Don’t worry – building modern data center infrastructure isn’t exactly rocket science. You can learn all you need to know about leaf-and-spine fabric designs in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Architectures">this webinar</a>, explore what vendors are doing in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics">this one</a>, or enjoy <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/EVPN_Technical_Deep_Dive">EVPN technical deep dive</a> with Dinesh Dutt. You get all three webinars plus dozens of others with <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">ipSpace.net subscription</a>. </p>
<p>Alternatively, if you prefer a guided/mentored tour with lots of checks and homework on the way, check out the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Designing_and_Building_Data_Center_Fabrics">Designing and Building Data Center Fabrics</a> online course, or <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Next-Generation_Data_Center">Building Next-Generation Data Center</a> if you want to understand a wider range of data center technologies.</p>
<p>Finally, I can’t help you much if your management decides to sponsor a vendor and buy a black box apart from pointing out the obvious drawbacks, as I did in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN">numerous SDN webinars</a>… but if you want to become an automation solution builder check out the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions">Building Network Automation Solutions</a> online course, which might come handy even if you go with a black-box solution – at least you’ll be able to identify which problems it should be able to solve, what components it should have, and what layers of abstraction it should offer.</p>
