title: EVPN Route Target Considerations in EBGP Environment
url: /2018/04/evpn-route-target-considerations-in.html
---
The proponents of the "*[let's run EVPN over EBGP underlay](https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/01/bgp-in-evpn-based-data-center-fabrics.html?showComment=1516881010563#c5554410204791451414)*" idea often ignore an interesting challenge: EVPN advocates the use of automatically-generated Route Targets, which might not work when every leaf switch uses a different AS number.

I explored this particular can of worms in the [EVPN Route Target Considerations](http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_BGP/EVPN_Route_Target_Considerations) section of the [Using BGP in a Data Center Leaf-and-Spine Fabric](http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_BGP) saga.
