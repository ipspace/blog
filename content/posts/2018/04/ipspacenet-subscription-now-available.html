<p>Every second blue moon someone asks me whether they could buy <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">ipSpace.net subscription</a> with PayPal. So far, the answer has been <em>no</em>.</p>
<p>Recently we started testing whether we could use <a href="https://www.digitalriver.com/company/">Digital River</a> to solve a few interesting challenges we had in the past, and as they offer PayPal as a payment option, it seemed to be a perfect fit for a low-volume trial.</p>
<p>The only product that you can buy with PayPal during the trial is the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual">standard subscription</a> â€“ just select PayPal as the payment method during the checkout process.</p>
<p>Finally: the first three subscribers using PayPal will get extra 6 months of subscription.</p>
