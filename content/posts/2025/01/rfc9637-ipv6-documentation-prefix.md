After three and a half years of haggling (the IETF draft that became the RFC was written in May 2001; the original discussions go back to 2013), Nick Buraglio & co managed to persuade pontificators bikeshedding in the v6ops working group that we might need an IPv6 documentation prefix larger than the existing `2001:db8::/32`.

With the new documentation prefix (`3fff::/20`) (defined in [RFC 9637](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9637.html)), there's absolutely no excuse to use public IPv6 address space in examples anymore.
