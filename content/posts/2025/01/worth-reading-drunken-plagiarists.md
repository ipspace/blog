George V. Neville-Neil published a fantastic, must-read summary of the various code copilots' usefulness on ACM Queue: [The Drunken Plagiarists](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&id=3711675).

It pretty much mirrors my experience (plus, I got annoyed when the semi-relevant suggestions kept kicking me out of the flow) and reminds me of the early days of OpenFlow, when nobody wanted to listen to old grunts like myself telling the world it was all hype and little substance.
