During the last three weeks, we were busy squashing bugs ([device configuration fixes](https://netlab.tools/release/1.9/#release-1-9-4-device-fixes), [other bug fixes](https://netlab.tools/release/1.9/#bug-fixes-1-9-4)). Some were recent; others were ancient pests uncovered by better integration tests. The end result: [_netlab_ release 1.9.4](https://netlab.tools/release/1.9/#release-1-9-4).

_netlab_ release 1.9.4 passed [hundreds of integration tests](https://release.netlab.tools/) and should be a better choice than the previous 1.9 releases. To upgrade, execute `pip3 install --upgrade networklab`.
