One of the recipes for [easy IS-IS deployments](https://isis.bgplabs.net/basic/1-simple-ipv4/#configuration-tasks) claims that you should use only level-2 routing (although most vendors enable level-1 and level-2 routing by default).

What does that mean, and why does it matter? You'll find the answers in the [Optimize Simple IS-IS Deployments](https://isis.bgplabs.net/basic/6-level-2/) lab exercise.
