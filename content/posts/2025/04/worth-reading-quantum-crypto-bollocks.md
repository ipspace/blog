Today is a perfect day to point out the fantastic [Why Quantum Cryptanalysis is Bollocks](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/bollocks.pdf) presentation (HT: [A blog post](https://blog.apnic.net/2025/03/21/a-load-of-old/) by George Michaelson) 

It's a must-read, even if you're absolutely uninterested in the topic. Just replace "Quantum mumbo-jumbo" with AI or SDN ;) Have fun!
