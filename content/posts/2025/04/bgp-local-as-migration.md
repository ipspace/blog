As I started describing the [iBGP Local-AS Details](/2025/04/ibgp-local-as-details/), I discovered that anything I ever wrote about the BGP local-as feature was hosted on a now-extinct website. Fortunately, I found a copy of that article in the Internet Archive and migrated it to the ipSpace.net blog. Hope you'll like it ;)
