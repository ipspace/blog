_The amount of weird stuff we [discover in netlab integration tests](/tag/netlab#quirks) is astounding, or maybe I have a knack for looking into the wrong dark corners (my wife would definitely agree with that). Today's special: when having two next hops kills a static route._

**TL&DR:** default ARP settings on a multi-subnet Linux host are [less than optimal](/2025/04/static-routes-arp/#sysctl).

We use these principles when creating [_netlab_ integration tests](https://tests.netlab.tools/):

* They should contain a single device-under-test and a bunch of attached probes.
* They should test a single feature.
* They should not rely on the device-under-test. All validation has to be done on probes.

How do you test static routes under these restrictions? Here's what we did:
<!--more-->
* Connect a device under test to a Linux node (running FRRouting) with a loopback interface.
* Configure a static route for the loopback interface on the device-under-test with the next hop pointing to the Ethernet IP address of the Linux node.
* On the Linux node, ping the Ethernet interface of the device-under-test from the loopback IP address.

The outgoing ICMP request packet should always be sent (the destination IP address is directly connected). The reply, however, will come back only when the device under test has a correctly configured static route for the source IP address of the ICMP request packet.

Here's a sample network topology (the test where we discovered this quirk was [a bit more convoluted](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab/blob/dev/tests/integration/routing/21-static-vrf.yml)):

This is the corresponding _netlab_ lab topology:

    - node: probe
      nexthop.node: probe

```

As expected, every correctly configured device easily passes this test. Mission accomplished.

```

Not really. There might be more than one link between the devices, in which case _netlab_ configures multiple static routes for the same destination. Let's rerun the test with the following topology:

{{<figure src="/2025/04/arp-static-multiple.png" caption="Two links, two next hops for the same destination">}}

Here's the relevant _netlab_ topology if you want to rerun the experiment. The only change is in line 13 (two links instead of one).

Most devices [pass this test with flying colors](https://tests.netlab.tools/_html/coverage.routing), but the **ping** command fails with vJunos-switch *until we ping the switch from the directly-connected Linux interface*:

```

This is clearly a gigantic WTAF moment, but fortunately, I [experienced similar stuff before](/2025/04/evpn-symmetric-irb-arp/) and immediately suspected we had to warm the ARP cache on one of the devices. Next step: A packet capture on the link that the ICMP request should be traversing. It might make your jaw drop ðŸ˜³

{{<cc>}}Weird ARP requests sent by the Linux node{{</cc>}}
```
$ netlab capture probe eth1 ip or arp
Starting packet capture on probe/eth1: sudo ip netns exec clab-X-probe tcpdump -i eth1 --immediate-mode -l -vv ip or arp
tcpdump: listening on eth1, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 262144 bytes
11:31:43.900846 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 10.1.0.1 tell 10.0.0.2, length 28
11:31:44.903669 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 10.1.0.1 tell 10.0.0.2, length 28
11:31:45.927675 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 10.1.0.1 tell 10.0.0.2, length 28
11:31:47.901226 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 10.1.0.1 tell 10.0.0.2, length 28
```

I can't decide what's weirder:

* Linux is sending an ARP request from the IP address belonging to another interface
* Junos is not answering that ARP request.

**Side note:** Pinging 10.1.0.1 from 10.1.0.2 warms the ARP cache on Linux and the Junos switch, so the subsequent ICMP packet sent from the loopback interface's IP address needs no ARP resolution.

Reading [RFC 826](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc826) is useless. It's so underspecified that it's impossible to answer whether Linux violates it (probably not). Furthermore, as I'm reading it, the receiver of an ARP request should respond to anything and enter *any address information* into its ARP table. I'm probably missing something (including some weird Linux **sysctl** parameter); comments are most welcome.

### But Why Did It Work with a Single Link?

Here's the head-scratching part: why did a single-link test work while the two-link test requires an ARP warmup exercise?

It turns out that Junos (like any other decent network device) preemptively resolves the next hops of the static routes. That creates an ARP entry on both ends of the link, and the ping works.

```

However, the vJunos-switch VM does that *only for one of the next hops*. In the two-link scenario, the static route has two next hops, but we can see only a single ARP entry in the ARP table:

The ARP cache on Linux mirrors that:

```
$ netlab connect probe arp

ge-0-0-1.0.dut (10.1.0.5) at 0c:00:8b:48:ac:02 [ether]  on eth2
ge-0-0-0.0.dut (10.1.0.1) at <incomplete>  on eth1
```

Ultimately, my incredible "luck" (I chose the wrong interface to ping) created this perfect storm, and I don't want to tell you how much time we wasted chasing this particular gremlin.

### Of Course, There's a sysctl Hack {#sysctl}

A few days after I wrote this blog post, Stefano Sasso encountered the same weird behavior when testing static routes on VyOS. This time, he [found the nerd knob to tweak](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab/issues/2157) to make Linux behave like a reasonable multi-subnet device. We [added that setting to the Linux and FRR initial configuration script](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab/pull/2159), hoping we won't encounter yet another even weirder variant in the future.
