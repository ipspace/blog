[Donatas Abraitis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ton31337/) asked me to spread the word about the first ever [Baltic NOG meeting in the second half of September 2025](https://events.balticnog.org/event/1/) ([more details](https://events.balticnog.org/event/1/attachments/2/2/BalticNOG%202025.pdf))

If you were looking for a nice excuse to visit that part of Europe (it's been on my wish list for a very long time), this might be a perfect opportunity to do it ðŸ˜Ž)

On a tangential topic of fascinating destinations ðŸ˜‰, there's also ITNOG in Bologna ([May 19th-20th](https://www.itnog.it/itnog9/), 2025), Autocon in Prague ([May 26th-30th](https://networkautomation.forum/autocon3), 2025), and SWINOG in Bern ([late June 2025](https://www.swinog.ch/meetings/swinog40/)).
