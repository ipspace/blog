Dmytro Shypovalov published another article well worth reading: [why should you use an SDN controller for RSVP-TE](https://routingcraft.net/why-use-an-sdn-controller-for-rsvp-te/). It covers:

* The reasons people might still prefer RSVP-TE over SR-MPLS and the current state of RSVP-TE
* What an SDN controller might bring to the RSVP-TE world
* SR/RSVP coexistence and interworking

Have fun!
