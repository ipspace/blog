[Pavel Odintsov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/podintsov/?ref=pavel.network) published a series of introductory blog posts describing protocols we can use to collect network traffic telemetry:

* [Part 1](https://pavel.network/network-traffic-telemetry-on-modern-routers-part-1/) covers the ancient Netflow v5, Netflow v9, and IPFIX. It also mentions sampling and flow aggregation.
* [Part 2](https://pavel.network/network-traffic-telemetry-on-modern-routers-part-2/) describes sFlow, port mirroring and sampled mirroring, and the use of IPFIX/Netflow v9 to transport mirrored traffic.

These blog posts will not make you an expert but will give you an excellent overview of the telemetry landscape[^TL].
