Ethan Banks created an excellent introductory *[Netlab - Automate Your Network Labs With YAML!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExPh5jBfKR0)* video showing how easy it is to [start and configure](https://netlab.tools/netlab/up/) a container- or VM-based lab, and explaining the basic [_netlab_ commands](https://netlab.tools/netlab/cli/) you need to get started.

Thanks a million!
