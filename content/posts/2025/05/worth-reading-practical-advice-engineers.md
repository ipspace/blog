Sean Goedecke published an interesting compilation of [practical advice for engineers](https://www.seangoedecke.com/in-these-troubled-times/). Not surprisingly, they include things like "_focus on fundamentals_" and "_spend your working time doing things that are valuable to the company and your career_" (OMG, does that really have to be said?).

Bonus point: a link to an article by Patrick McKenzie (of the [Bits About Money](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/) fame) explaining why you [SHOULD NOT call yourself a programmer](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/) (there goes the _everyone should be a programmer_ gospel ðŸ˜œ).
