Did you ever wonder why pressing an up-arrow in a (Linux) terminal window sometimes recalls the previous command but other times creates `^[[A`?

[Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) did, and spent months exploring the quirks of the Linux terminal (and writing [blog posts](https://jvns.ca/categories/terminal/) describing what she found), finally resulting in [The Secret Rules of the Terminal](https://wizardzines.com/zines/terminal/) (including the various shells, terminal emulators, escape codes, and TTY driver). A must-read if you're a newbie who wants to understand why things happen the way they do.
