I love well-organized small conferences, so it wasn't hard to persuade me to have another talk at the [DEEP Conference](https://deep-conference.com/) in Zadar, Croatia. This time, I talked about the role of digital twins in disaster recovery/avoidance testing. You might know [my take](https://blog.ipspace.net/2022/04/digital-twin-powerpoint/) on [networking digital twins](https://blog.ipspace.net/2025/06/digital-twins-powerpoint-reality/); after that, I only had enough time to focus on *bandwidth and latency matter*, and *this is how you emulate limited bandwidth and add latency* bit.

I also took the opportunity to attend several other presentations. While one of them unfortunately turned out to be inescapable vendor slop[^VS], I was fortunate enough to attend a highly interesting presentation by [Tena Velki](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rZmeYncAAAAJ&hl=en) on how hackers exploit our [system-1 thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) (aka reptilian/limbic brain) and some of our [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) to make us click on a link or download malware, followed by a presentation by Vanja Å vajcer describing the tools used by North Korean hackers.

[^VS]: When you have two presenters (one working for a vendor and another for the local channel partner), and the local guy starts with Gartner quotes, while the vendor presenter starts with industry analyst reports, it's time to walk away quietly. At least the presenters weren't AI-generated ðŸ˜œ

The conference organizers always manage to attract local (= Croatian) presenters working on large international challenges. This year, I stumbled upon [Luka KladariÄ‡](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukakladaric/), who's developing a universal gateway for database protocols that can provide granular control over developer/support access to production databases.

Fortunately, DEEP remains a boutique conference with a personal touch where the organizers care about the well-being of presenters and attendees, so I hope to be back in 2026, and it would be great to meet and chat with fellow networking engineers (hint, hint ;)
