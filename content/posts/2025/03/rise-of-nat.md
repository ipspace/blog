When [Ned Bellavance](https://pod.chaoslever.com/about/) asked me to be a guest on the Chaos Lever podcast talking about NAT, I replied, "_and why do you hate me so much?_"

However, it turned out one can have a fun conversation about a controversial topic. For more details, listen to [The Rise of NAT](https://pod.chaoslever.com/the-rise-of-nat-a-necessary-evil-in-networking-chaos-lever/) on [Chaos Lever](https://pod.chaoslever.com/). I hope you'll enjoy it ;)
