One of the most significant problems engineers face when trying to improve their online presence is the "How do I start writing?" roadblock (hint: publishing bland AI-generated slop won't get you far unless you aim to become a Thought Leader).

[Zvi Mowshowitz](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/about/) collected [links to over a dozen different writing styles](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2025/03/04/on-writing-1/), starting with JRR Tolkien. I'm pretty sure you'll find something useful in that vast collection.
