Like OSPF, IS-IS needs a router to originate the pseudo-node for a LAN segment. IS-IS standards call that router a Designated Intermediate System (DIS), and since it is not responsible for flooding, it does not need a backup.

Want to know more? The [Influence the Designated IS Election](https://isis.bgplabs.net/feature/2-dis/) lab exercise provides the details (and some hands-on work).
