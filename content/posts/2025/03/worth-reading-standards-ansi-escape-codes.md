I encountered the *Escape sequences* (named [after the first character in the sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character#ASCII_escape_character)) while programming stuff that would look nicely on the venerable VT100 terminals (not to mention writing one or two VT100 emulators myself).

In the meantime, those sequences got standardized and (par for the course) extended with "proprietary" stuff everyone uses now. [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) did a great job [documenting the state of the art](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/03/07/escape-code-standards/). Thanks a million!
