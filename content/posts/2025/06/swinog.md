A few days ago, I attended a [SwiNOG meeting](https://www.swinog.ch/meetings/) for the first time and realized what a mistake I was making â€” I should have been there years ago.

Not only was the event impeccably organized (what else would you expect in Switzerland) and at the best event location I have ever experienced (it's hard to beat [this view](https://gurtenpark.roundshot.com/#/)), it was also full of short, interesting, up-to-the-point presentations ([view the slide decks and videos](https://www.swinog.ch/meetings/swinog40/)). Plus, I met so many old friends I haven't seen in years, and people I communicated with for years but never met before.

It's not like the organizers would need any more publicity (the event was sold out), but if you happen to be near Switzerland in time for the next meeting, make sure to be there.

Thanks again to the wonderful SwiNOG core team for a fantastic experience! I hope we'll meet again at the next SwiNOG meeting!
