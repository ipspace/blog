In his latest blog post ([Systems design 3: LLMs and the semantic revolution](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20251120)), Avery Pennarun claims that LLMs might solve the problem we consistently failed to solve on a large scale for the last 60 (or so) years -- the automated B2B data exchange.

You might agree with him or not (for example, an accountant or two might get upset with hallucinated invoice items), but his articles are always a fun read.
