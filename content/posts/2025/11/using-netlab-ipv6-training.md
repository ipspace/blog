In March 2024, I received my [first PR](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab/pull/1050) from an airplane: [Sander Steffann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandersteffann/) was flying to South Africa to deliver an Ansible training and fixed a minor annoyance in the then-new multilab feature.

Of course, I wanted to know more about his setup, but it took us over a year and a half till we managed to sit down (virtually) and chat about it, the state of IPv6, the impact of CG-NAT on fraud prevention, and why digital twins don't make sense in large datacenter migrations.

For more details, listen to Episode 202 of Software Gone Wild.
