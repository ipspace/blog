[Vadim Semenov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vadim-semenov-1b538130/) created a [nice demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92YBRXqZWUo) that allows you to use an LLM to query the collected link-state graphs through an MCP agent ([SuzieQ](https://suzieq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) would probably be faster and easier to deploy, but hey, AI).

If you want to kick the tires, you'll find the source code on GitHub ([Network AI assistant](https://github.com/Vadims06/network-ai-assistant), [MCP server for Topolograph service](https://github.com/Vadims06/topolograph-mcp-server)). You'll also need Vadim's previous projects: [Topolograph](https://github.com/Vadims06/topolograph) and [OSPF watcher](https://github.com/Vadims06/ospfwatcher) or [IS-IS watcher](https://github.com/Vadims06/isiswatcher).
