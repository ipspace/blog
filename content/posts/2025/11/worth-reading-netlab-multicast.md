[Aleksandr Albin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandr-albin-421463191/) built a large (almost 20-router) lab topology that he uses to practice inter-AS IP multicast. He also [published the topology file](https://github.com/alex4lbin/network_labs/tree/main/jd_multicast_lab) (and additional configuration templates) on GitHub and [documented his experience](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7394777753004236800/) in a LinkedIn post.

It's so nice to see engineers using your tool in real-life scenarios. Thanks a million, Aleksandr, for sharing it.
