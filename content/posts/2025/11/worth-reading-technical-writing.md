[Sean Goedecke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-goedecke-5495a7137/) published [an excellent set of recommendations for good technical writing](https://www.seangoedecke.com/technical-communication/), including:

* Keep it short
* Try to make your point in the first sentence
* Details matter less than you think.

Based on some emails I received in the past (and the lack of response to the lengthy emails I sent), we should apply the same rules to emails (and all other forms of technical communication).
