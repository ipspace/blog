Rodney Brooks republished an article on [great AI expectations](https://rodneybrooks.com/ai-great-expectations/) that he wrote 37 years ago. Not surprisingly, apart from a few technical details triggered by four decades of exponential growth in silicon capabilities, the article could have been written yesterday.

Side note: I'm a bit younger than Rodney, but I also went through at least three waves of AI hype cycles, starting with Prolog and 4GL, then expert systems, and finally neural networks. Around that time, I stopped caring and focused on networking, but I have enough battle scars to remain skeptical.
