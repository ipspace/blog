In early August, [William Collins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-collins/) invited me to [chat](https://packetpushers.net/podcasts/the-cloud-gambit/tcg056-network-automation-reality-check-with-ivan-pepelnjak/) about a [sarcastic comment I made](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7351491325029957633?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7351491325029957633%2C7352048218139947009%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287352048218139947009%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7351491325029957633%29) about a specific automation tool I have a love-hate relationship with on LinkedIn.

We quickly agreed not to go (too deep) into tool-bashing. Instead, we discussed the eternal problems of network automation, from unhealthy obsession with tools to focus on point solutions while lacking the bigger picture or believing in vendor-delivered nirvana.
