They say time goes faster as you get older, and it seems to be true. Another year has (almost) gone by.

Try to disconnect from the crazy pace of the networking world, forget the "_vibe coding with AI will make engineers obsolete_" stupidities (hint: [Fifth Generation Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth-generation_programming_language) and Natural Language Programming were all the rage in the 1980s and 1990s), and focus on your loved ones. I would also like to wish you all the best in 2026!

In the meantime, I'm working on weaning _netlab_ off of a particular automation tool (you can always track the progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab)). Expect the first results in the January _netlab_ release.
