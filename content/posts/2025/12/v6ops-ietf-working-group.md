The first IPv6 specs were published in 1995, and yet 30 years later, we still have a pretty active [IETF working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/v6ops/about/) focused on "_developing guidelines for the deployment and operation of new and existing IPv6 networks._" (taken from the [old charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-v6ops/05/); they [updated it](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-v6ops/06/) in late October 2025). Why is it taking so long, and what problems are they trying to solve?

Nick Buraglio, one of the working group chairs, provided some answers in [Episode 203](http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_203-IETF_v6ops_Working_Group_with_Nick_Buraglio.mp3) of the Software Gone Wild podcast.
