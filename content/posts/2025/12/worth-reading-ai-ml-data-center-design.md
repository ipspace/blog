What could be better than watching [0x02 Jeffs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMYH1xDLIabuZCr1Yeoo39enogPA2yJB7) discuss networking? How about having [Petr Lapukhov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petrlapu/) of the [RFC 7938](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7938) fame as a guest discussing [AI/ML Data Center Design](https://www.youtube.com/live/Xoji3cEDl2Y)?

**Note:** Petr disappeared into the information black hole called Facebook over a decade ago, so I wondered how they allowed him to chat on a podcast for hours. It turns out he moved to NVIDIA, which might influence the podcast content a bit, but I'm pretty sure Petr is still Petr ;)
