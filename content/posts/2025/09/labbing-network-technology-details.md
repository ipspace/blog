It's been over four years since I published the [last Software Gone Wild episode](/2021/04/bringing-young-blood-in-networking/). In the meantime, I spent most of my time developing an [open-source labbing tool](https://netlab.tools/), so it should be no surprise that the first post-hiatus episode focused on a _netlab_ use case: how Ethan Banks (of the [PacketPushers](https://packetpushers.net/) fame) is using the tool to quickly check the technology details for his [N is for Networking](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/n-is-for-networking/) podcast.

As expected, our discussion took us all over the place, including (according to Riverside AI):
<!--more-->
* Introduction to the next generation of Software Gone Wild
* Ethan's netlab use case
* Building and managing lab environments
* Future of netlab and community contributions
* Navigating netlab's [multilab capabilities](https://netlab.tools/plugins/multilab/)
* Understanding netlab's orchestration and configuration
* Modeling networking protocols in netlab
* Community contributions and feature development
* Enhancing user experience and documentation
* Exploring multi-vendor configurations

And as the same AI offered to produce the takeaways, here they are ;)

- Netlab simplifies the process of building network labs.
- YAML configuration allows for easy setup of complex network topologies.
- There is a strong demand for fundamental networking knowledge.
- Netlab supports multi-vendor environments for diverse networking scenarios.
- Community contributions enhance the functionality of netlab.
- Automation tools can significantly reduce the time spent on lab setups.
- The future of netlab includes ongoing development and feature enhancements.
- Documentation and community support are crucial for new users.
- Netlab's orchestration capabilities streamline network management.
- Engaging with the community through GitHub discussions can improve the tool.
