[_netlab_ release 25.09](/2025/09/netlab-25-09/) introduced [numerous graphing enhancements](https://netlab.tools/release/25.09/#release-25-09-graph) and a new graph type (IS-IS graphs), so I decided to write a series of blog posts explaining how you can generate graphs from _netlab_ lab topologies.

I wrote an *intro to netlab topology graphs* years ago, and as expected, it was hopelessly outdated, so I started the project with a complete overhaul of that article.
