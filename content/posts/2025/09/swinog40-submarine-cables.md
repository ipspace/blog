If you know as much about submarine cables (the thingies that carry 90% of international Internet traffic) as I do (= nothing), you SHOULD watch the [Technical Update on Submarine Cables](https://www.swinog.ch/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Liam-Taylor-David-Lloyd-Exa-A-Technical-Update-on-Submarine-Cables.pdf) ([video](https://youtu.be/JYblPwg70Ns)) presentation  Liam Taylor had at the [SwiNOG 40 event](/2025/06/swinog/). Have fun ;)
