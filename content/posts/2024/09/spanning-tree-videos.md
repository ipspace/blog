In May 2024, I made public the first half of the [Network Connectivity and Graph Theory](https://www.ipspace.net/Network_Connectivity,_Graph_Theory,_and_Reliable_Network_Design)  videos by [Rachel Traylor](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Rachel_Traylor).

Now, you can also enjoy the [second part of the webinar](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Graph#TREE) without a valid ipSpace.net account; it describes trees, spanning trees, and the Spanning Tree Protocol. Enjoy!
