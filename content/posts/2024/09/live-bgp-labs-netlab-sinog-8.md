I'll talk about the [BGP labs](https://bgplabs.net/) and the [magic behind the scenes](https://blog.ipspace.net/2024/05/netlab-integration-tests/) that ensures the lab configurations are correct at the [SINOG 8 meeting](https://www.sinog.si/sinog-8-0/) later today (selecting the English version of the website is counter-intuitive; choose English from the drop-down field on the right-hand side of the page).

The SINOG 8 presentations will be [live-streamed](https://www.sinog.si/sinog-8-0/live/); I should start [around 13:15 Central European Time](https://www.sinog.si/sinog-8-0/program-srecanja/) (11:15 GMT; figuring out the local time is left as an exercise for the reader).
