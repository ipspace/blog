Retirement obviously does not sit well with my friend [Tiziano Tofoni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiziano-tofoni-1361759); the English version of his [IPv6 book](https://www.amazon.com/IPv6-instructions-use-Tiziano-Tofoni/dp/B0DGL5TPP4/ref=sr_1_1) just came out.

It is a bit sad, though, that we still need "how to use IPv6" books when the protocol is old enough to enjoy a nice glass of whiskey (in the US) trying to drown its sorrow at its slow adoption.
