Nick Buraglio and Brian E. Carpenter published a [free, open-source IPv6 textbook](https://ipv6textbook.com/).

The book seems to be in an early (ever-evolving) stage, but it's well worth exploring if you're new to the IPv6 world, and you might consider contributing if you're a seasoned old-timer.

It would also be nice to have a few online labs to go with it ;)
