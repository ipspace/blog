A year after I started the [open-source BGP configuration labs](https://bgplabs.net/) project, I was persuaded to do [something similar for IS-IS](https://isis.bgplabs.net/). The [first labs](https://isis.bgplabs.net/basic/) are already online (with [plenty of additional ideas](https://isis.bgplabs.net/3-upcoming/) already in the queue), and you can [run them](https://isis.bgplabs.net/1-setup/) on any device for which we [implemented IS-IS support in netlab](https://netlab.tools/module/isis/#platform-support).

Want an easy start? Use [GitHub Codespaces](https://isis.bgplabs.net/4-codespaces/). Have a laptop with Apple Silicon? [We have you covered](https://blog.ipspace.net/2024/03/netlab-bgp-apple-silicon/) ;)
