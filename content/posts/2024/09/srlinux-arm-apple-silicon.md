When looking for the [latest SR Linux container image](https://github.com/nokia/srlinux-container-image/pkgs/container/srlinux), I noticed images with **-arm-preview** tags and wondered whether they would run on Apple Silicon.

**TL&DR:** YES, IT WORKS ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰

Here's what you have to do to make SR Linux work with *netlab* running on a Ubuntu VM on Apple silicon:
<!--more-->
* Follow the instructions from the [Running netlab and BGP Labs on Apple Silicon](/2024/03/netlab-bgp-apple-silicon/) blog post. Make sure to increase disk size to at least 10 GB, memory size to 8 GB, and to let the virtual machine use four CPU cores.
* Copy the following lab topology into an empty directory:

```
provider: clab
defaults.device: srlinux
defaults.devices.srlinux.clab.image: ghcr.io/nokia/srlinux:24.7.2-arm-preview

nodes: [ r1,r2 ]
links: [ r1-r2 ]
module: [ ospf ]
```

* Execute **netlab up** and have fun.

{{<note info>}}The SR Linux ARM images have the **-arm-preview** suffix in their tags, requiring us to modify the netlab defaults. I hope that will disappear after a while, making it possible to run SR Linux on ARM without changing the container tags.

Until that happens, you have to change the SR Linux default image, either in the lab topology or in the system defaults ([more details](https://netlab.tools/example/release/#tutorial-release)).{{</note>}}

Once you verify that the SR Linux containers run on your Apple silicon, have fun [using them](https://bgplabs.net/1-setup/#select-the-network-devices-you-will-work-with) in the [BGP labs](https://bgplabs.net/).
