In the first exercise in the [IS-IS labs](https://isis.bgplabs.net/) series, you'll [configure IS-IS routing for IPv4](https://isis.bgplabs.net/basic/1-simple-ipv4/). The basic configuration is trivial, but you'll also have to tweak the defaults that most vendors got wrong (we'll discuss why those defaults are wrong in the next lab exercises).

I also tried to make the IS-IS labs more than just lab exercises. Each exercise includes a bit of background information or IS-IS theory; this one describes [generic OSI addresses (NSAPs) and router addresses (NETs)](https://isis.bgplabs.net/basic/1-simple-ipv4/#bg).
