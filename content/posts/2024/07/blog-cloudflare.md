**Long story short:** Years after [migrating my blog to Hugo](/2020/03/ipspace-blog-runs-on-hugo/), I found the willpower to deal with the "interesting" way Cloudflare Pages deal with static HTML files, changed the Hugo URL scheme, and spent two days fixing broken links.

Apart from having the satisfaction of ticking off a long-outstanding project, the blog pages should load faster, and I won't have to deal with GitLab hiccups anymore.

If you notice anything being broken, please let me know. Thank you!
