[Dmytro Shypovalov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmytro-shypovalov-573aab58/) wrote a fantastic article [explaining the basics of MPLS-based Segment Routing](https://routingcraft.net/making-segment-routing-user-friendly). It's pretty much equivalent to everything I ever wrote about SR-MPLS but in a much nicer package. Definitely a must-read.
