Daniel Dib went on another deep dive: [Why Do We Have Native VLANs?](https://lostintransit.se/2024/07/08/why-do-we-have-native-vlans/) What I loved most was that he went through the whole 802.1 standard (quite an undertaking) and explained the reasoning that VLAN-aware switches behave the way they do.

You should also read the follow-up post: [what happens if a VLAN-unaware switch receives an 802.1Q-tagged frame](https://lostintransit.se/2024/07/09/802-1q-tagged-frames-through-unmanaged-switch-forwarded-or-dropped/)?
