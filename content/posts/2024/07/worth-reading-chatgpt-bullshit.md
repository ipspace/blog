[Bogdan Golab](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bogdan-golab-258558/) sent me a link to an (open access) article in Ethics and Information Technology arguing why [ChatGPT is bullshit](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5). Straight from the introduction:

> Because these programs cannot themselves be concerned with truth, and because they are designed to produce text that looks truth-apt without any actual concern for truth, it seems appropriate to call their outputs bullshit.

Have fun!
