Here's another AI rant to spice your summer: [AI Is Still a Delusion](https://mindmatters.ai/2024/06/ai-is-still-a-delusion/), including an excellent example of how the latest LLMs flunk simple logical reasoning. I particularly liked this one-line summary:

> The real danger today is not that computers are smarter than us but that we think computers are smarter than us and consequently trust them to make decisions they should not be trusted to make.

It might be worth remembering that quote when an AI-powered management appliance messes up your network because of a false positive ;)
