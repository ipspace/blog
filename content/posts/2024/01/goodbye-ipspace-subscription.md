I ran the first webinar as an independent author almost exactly fourteen years ago[^FW], with the first ticket sold just before New Year's Eve. I kept focusing on individual webinars until someone asked me, "_Would it be possible to buy access to everything you did?_" His question effectively created the ipSpace.net subscription, with the first one sold in late 2010 (I still have the email that triggered the whole process).

Since then, the materials kept accumulating, and as of late 2023, the ipSpace.net subscription included almost 90 webinars with over 1800 videos for a total length of over 400 hours.

Unfortunately, the second law of thermodynamics remains as ruthless as ever, and all things eventually come to an end -- it's no longer possible to buy an ipSpace.net subscription[^NX]. If you had an active subscription on January 1st, 2024, I extended it for another 75 years; if you did not, you missed it.

Finally, I would like to thank everyone who ever bought a subscription. Without you, there would have been no ipSpace.net content. You enabled me to create everything I already mentioned and all the free stuff (including over 4000 blog posts) that other networking nerds kept reading for years. I guess they should thank you profusely, but we all know how the Internet works ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è From my end, I'm forever grateful to everyone who trusted me.

Last but definitely not least, it looks like you won't get rid of me[^WME]. I will write an occasional blog post, I already have ideas for virtual labs covering other technologies (not just [BGP](https://bgplabs.net/)), and I'll keep improving [the tool that makes those labs possible](https://netlab.tools/).

[^NX]: Before you ask, no, I can't make exceptions, even if you were on a long trip with no Internet access while the dog ate your email.

[^WME]: One of my kids remarked, "_now that you no longer work, you work more than you worked when you were still working_."
