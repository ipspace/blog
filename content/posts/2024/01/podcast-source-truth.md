Figuring out how to describe your network (also known as "_create a source of truth_") is one of the most challenging tasks you'll face when building a network automation solution ([more](/series/ssot.html)). As always, the devil is in the details, starting with "_and what exactly is The Truth?_".

We discussed those details in a lively [Packet Pushers podcast](https://packetpushers.net/podcasts/heavy-networking/hn717-network-sources-of-truth-a-roundtable-discussion/) with Claudia de Luna,  David Sinn, Dinesh Dutt, Drew Conry-Murray and Ethan Banks. Have fun!
