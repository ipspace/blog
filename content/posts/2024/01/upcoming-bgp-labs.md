It's that time of the year when we create unreachable goals and make empty promises to ourselves (or others) that we subconsciously know we'll fail.

I tried to make that process a bit more structured and create external storage for my lab ideas -- I started publishing more details on future BGP lab scenarios. The lab descriptions contain a high-level overview of the challenge and the lab topology; the details will be filled in later.
