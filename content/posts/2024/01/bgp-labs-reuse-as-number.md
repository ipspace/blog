When I published theÂ [Bidirectional Route Redistribution](https://bgplabs.net/basic/5-redistribute/) lab exercise, some readers were [quick to point out](https://blog.ipspace.net/2023/09/bgp-labs-redistribute.html#1920) that you'll probably have to reuse the same AS number across multiple sites in a real-life MPLS/VPN deployment. That's what you can practice in [today's lab exercise](https://bgplabs.net/session/1-allowas_in/) -- an MPLS/VPN service provider allocated the same BGP AS number to all your sites and expects you to deal with the aftermath.
