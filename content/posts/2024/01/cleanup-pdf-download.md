I published dozens of free-to-download slide decks on ipSpace.net. Downloading them required the *free ipSpace.net subscription* which is no longer available because I refuse to play a whack-a-mole game with spammers.

You might like the workaround I had to implement to keep those PDFs accessible: they are no longer behind a regwall.

You can find the list of all the free content ipSpace.net content [here](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free). The [Conferences and Presentations](https://www.ipspace.net/Presentations/) page is another source of links to public presentations.
