One of the delightful side effects of leaving the paid content business is that I no longer have to try to persuade anyone that my content is any good. That includes the "_this video is now public_" announcements -- instead of elaborate introductions, I'll just publish a short blog post with the links. 

As of today, these videos (along with dozens of previously-released videos) from the [Routing Protocols](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Net101#ROUTING) section of the [How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work) webinar are no longer behind a login wall:
