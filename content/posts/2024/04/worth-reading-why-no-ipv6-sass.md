Lasse Haugen had enough of the never-ending "we can't possibly deploy IPv6" excuses and decided to start the [IPv6 Shame-as-a-Service website](https://whynoipv6.com/), documenting top websites that still don't offer IPv6 connectivity.

His list includes well-known entries like *twitter.com*, *azure.com*, and *github.com* plus a few unexpected ones. I find *cloudflare.net* not having an AAAA DNS record truly hilarious. Someone within the company that flawlessly provided my website with IPv6 connectivity for years obviously still has some reservations about their own dogfood ;)
