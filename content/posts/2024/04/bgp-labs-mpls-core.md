Here's another challenge for BGP aficionados: [build an MPLS-based transit network without BGP running on core routers](https://bgplabs.net/challenge/40-mpls-core/).

That should be an easy task if you configured MPLS in the past, so try to spice it up a bit:

* Use SR/MPLS instead of LDP
* Do it on a platform you're not familiar with (hint: Arista vEOS is a bit different from Cisco IOS)
* Try to get it running on FRR containers.
