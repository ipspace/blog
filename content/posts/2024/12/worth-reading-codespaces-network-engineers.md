When I discovered GitHub Codespaces (thanks to a [pointer by Roman Dodin](https://containerlab.dev/manual/codespaces/)), I did the absolute minimum of research to get _netlab_ up and running in a container to enable Codespaces-based labs ([BGP](https://bgplabs.net/4-codespaces/), [IS-IS](https://isis.bgplabs.net/4-codespaces/)) and [netlab examples](https://blog.ipspace.net/2024/07/netlab-examples-codespaces/).

However, if you want to know the behind-the-scenes details, you MUST read the [Codespaces for Network Engineers and Educators](https://juliopdx.com/2024/11/25/codespaces-for-network-engineers-and-educators/) deep dive by Julio Perez.
