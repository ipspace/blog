Another year is almost gone, and it's time for my traditional "_I will disappear until mid-January_" retreat (also, don't expect me to read my email until I'm back).

I hope you'll also be able to disconnect from the crazy pace of the networking world, forget the "_AI will make networking engineers obsolete_" shenanigans (hint: SDN did not), and focus on your loved ones. I would also like to wish you all the best in 2025!

I will probably get bored sometime in late December, so expect a few new _netlab_ features in early January.
