I had a *Disaster Recovery Myths and Reality* talk at the [DEEP conference](https://deep-conference.com/) yesterday. The [presentation is already online](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/AADesign/Disaster%20Recovery%20Myths.pdf?doccode=AADesign), but unfortunately, not everyone made it to Zadar (your loss, but I get it).

To counteract that, I made the first part of the [Designing Active-Active and Disaster Recovery Data Centers](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=AADesign) webinar public. Hope you'll like it.
