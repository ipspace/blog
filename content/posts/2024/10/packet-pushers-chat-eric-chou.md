A while ago, Eric Chou invited me to a friendly chat in his [Network Automation Nerds podcast](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/network-automation-nerds/). 

The episode was [published a few days ago](https://packetpushers.net/podcasts/network-automation-nerds/nan075-mastering-networking-in-the-age-of-ai-advice-for-aspiring-engineers/); I hope you'll enjoy listening to it.
