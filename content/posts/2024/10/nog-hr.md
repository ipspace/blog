I never know what to expect when I'm invited to speak at a regional (or in-country) Network Operator Group (NOG) meeting. Sometimes, it turns out to be a large conference (PLNOG and ITNOG come to mind); other times, it's just a few people gathered around free donuts and coffee[^SP]. Last week's [Croatian NOG (NOG.HR) meeting](https://nog.hr/en/meetups/meetup5/) was in the Goldilocks zone between the extremes: plenty of interested networking engineers, but not large enough to be overpowering.

[^SP]: Assuming the organizers managed to get a sponsor.

Also, it was such a nice experience ;)

The organizers did an excellent job, the presentations were interesting[^OIA], and I don't think I ever got so many relevant questions after my netlab presentation. The questions evolved into a long hallway discussion (another first) that generated several interesting ideas including *running an SDN lab with Open vSwitch*, *[link impairment capability](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab/issues/1387)*, *[starting a lab from a remote GitHub repo](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab/issues/1388)*, and adding support for [OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/about/about-opnsense/)[^SIV].

[^OIA]: At least the ones I attended; I missed the SRv6 one while discussing netlab enhancement ideas.

[^SIV]: Someone might have inadvertently volunteered to do that ;)

The only missing bit: while the meetup presentations are usually published a few days after the conference, it seems they're not publishing a recording of the event.

To summarize: if Zagreb is not too far away from where you are, NOG.HR is worth attending, and I plan to be back, hopefully with another interesting presentation.

And now, I have to get ready for the next stop on my Croatian road trip: the [DEEP conference in Zadar](https://deep-conference.com/). It's starting on Wednesday, so you can probably still register if you want to attend my *Disaster Recovery Myths and Vendor Fairy Tales* presentation.
