[Urs Baumann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ubaumannch/) loves hands-on teaching and created tons of lab exercises to support his [Infrastructure-as-Code automation course](https://www.youtube.com/@infrastructureascode).

During the summer, he [published some of them](https://netautlabs.net/) in a [collection of GitHub repositories](https://github.com/NetAutLabs/) and made them work in GitHub Codespaces. An amazing idea well worth exploring!
