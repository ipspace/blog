Just in case you want to kick the semi-finished wheels ;) The upcoming _netlab_ release 1.9 includes a *generic routing module* that implements route maps, prefix lists, AS-path access lists, and BGP community lists. The new features are [already implemented on the "usual" platforms](https://tests.netlab.tools/_html/coverage.routing).

To test the new release, install netlab first, and then upgrade it with `pip3 install --upgrade --pre networklab`. The interim documentation is [here](https://5772ef9a.netlab.pages.dev/) (you can also [browse the documentation directory on GitHub](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab/tree/dev/docs)).
