[Urs Baumann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ubaumannch/) invited me to have a guest lecture in his network automation course, and so I had the privilege of being in lovely Rapperswil last week, talking about the basics of real-life network automation.

Urs published [the video recording of the presentation](https://youtu.be/T4gPoSqaCHU) on YouTube; hope you'll like it, and if you don't get too annoyed by the overly pushy ads, watch the [other videos from his infrastructure-as-code course](https://www.youtube.com/@infrastructureascode).
