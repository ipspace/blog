It looks like DMVPN is still kicking; every other blue moon, I get a "*Thank you*" note from someone figuring out the DMVPN details from my first DMVPN webinar, so I decided to make those videos public. You can watch [any video](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DMVPN) from the [DMVPN Technology and Configuration](https://www.ipspace.net/DMVPN_Technology_and_Configuration) without registration.

A tangential note in case you're wondering how "easy" it is to refurbish old stuff:

* The webinar was recorded as a WebEx ARF recording.
* The WebEx MP4 exporter I used when trying to generate videos from my old ARF files was broken and couldn't produce usable videos after a long silence (I muted the microphone during a coffee break). I gave up at that time
* A few weeks ago, I decided to replay the recording and create videos from the screen capture.
* Finally, it took my audio editor quite a while to make the sound recorded with 8-bit 8 kHz codec (thank you, WebEx) sound better than Apollo 11 communications with Houston.
