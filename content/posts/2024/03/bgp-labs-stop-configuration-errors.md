Last time, we discussed the first line of defense against fat finger incidents: [limiting the number of BGP prefixes your router accepts from a BGP neighbor](https://bgplabs.net/basic/b-max-prefix/). However, you can do much more without deploying customer-specific filters (which might require a customer database) or ROV/RPKI.

You can practice the default filters you should always deploy on EBGP sessions with your customers in the [Stop the Propagation of Configuration Errors](https://bgplabs.net/challenge/04-block-fat-fingers/) lab exercise.
