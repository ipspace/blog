One of the key arguments against stretched clusters (and similar stupidities) I used in my [Disaster Recovery Myths](https://blog.ipspace.net/2024/10/disaster-recovery-videos/) presentation was the SSD read latency versus cross-site round-trip time.

Thanks to [Networking Notes](https://blog.computer-networking.info/), I found [a great infographic I can use in my next presentation](https://cheat.sh/latencies) (bonus points: it also works great in a terminal when fetched with curl) and a [site that checks the latency of your web site](https://geofetcher.appsinprogress.com/) from various vantage points.
