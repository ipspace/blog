In a [previous BGP lab exercise](https://bgplabs.net/session/3-localas/), I described how an Internet Service Provider could run BGP with a customer without the customer having a public BGP AS number. The only drawback of that approach: the private BGP AS number gets into the AS path, and everyone else on the Internet starts giving you dirty looks (or drops your prefixes). 

{{<figure src="https://bgplabs.net/session/topology-removeprivate.png">}}

Let's fix that. Most BGP implementations have some **remove private AS** functionality that scrubs AS paths during outgoing update processing. You can practice it in the [Remove Private BGP AS Numbers from the AS Path](https://bgplabs.net/session/4-removeprivate/) lab exercise.
