One of the previous BGP labs explained how you can use *session templates* to configure common TCP or BGP session parameters. Some BGP implementations have another templating mechanism: *policy templates* that you can use to apply consistent routing policy parameters to an EBGP neighbor. You can practice them in the [next BGP lab exercise](https://bgplabs.net/session/7-policy/).
