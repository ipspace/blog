[Sharada Yeluri](https://blog.apnic.net/author/sharada-yeluri/) published an interesting overview of the [evolution of network security](https://blog.apnic.net/2024/06/24/the-evolution-of-network-security/), from packet filtering firewalls to GenAI and Quantum Computing (yeah, she works for a networking vendor ;). Definitely worth reading if you're looking for an intro-level overview.
