During the [ITNOG8](https://www.itnog.it/itnog8/) _netlab_ presentation, I jokingly said something along the lines "_all that's missing is RIPv2 and Babel_."  That's no longer true; someone asked me how hard it would be to add RIPv2 to _netlab_, and I said, "_give me a few days_ ðŸ˜Ž"

Other new features in [_netlab_ release 1.8.3](https://netlab.tools/release/1.8/#release-1-8-3) include support for BGP route servers (and route server clients), BGP Link Bandwidth community, and OSPF/BGP validation plugins for Arista EOS, Cumulus Linux and FRR. We also fixed the installation scripts to work with Ubuntu 24.04 and Debian Bookworm.

For more details, [read the release notes](https://netlab.tools/release/1.8/#release-1-8-3).
