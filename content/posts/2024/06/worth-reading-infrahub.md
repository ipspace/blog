A year or two after [Damien Garros](https://www.linkedin.com/in/damiengarros/) told me that "_he moved to France and is working on something new_" we can admire the results: Infrahub, a version-control-based system that includes a data store and a repository of all source code you use in your network automation environment. Or, [straight from the GitHub repository](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub),

> A central hub to manage the data, templates and playbooks that powers your infrastructure by combining the version control and branch management capabilities of Git with the flexible data model and UI of a graph database.

I've seen an early demo, and it looks highly promising and absolutely worth exploring. Have fun ;)

{{<note>}}Fun fact: the OpsMill team includes [two guest speakers](https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions#Guest_speakers) in the ipSpace.net automation course and a [netlab contributor](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab/graphs/contributors).
