Marc Brooker published an interesting blog post arguing that 
[we need distributed systems for more than just scale](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2024/06/04/scale.html).

Keep that in mind the next time someone tries to sell you the beauties of a centralized control plane -- an idea that should be dead by now regardless of what [ONF keeps preaching](https://opennetworking.org/sdn-definition/) but will inevitably reappear in some form or other due to [RFC 1925](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1925) Rule 11.
