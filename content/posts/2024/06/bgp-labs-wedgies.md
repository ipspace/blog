[RFC 4264](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4264) defines BGP wedgies as "_a class of BGP configurations for which there is more than one potential outcome, and where forwarding states other than the intended state are equally stable._" Even worse, "_the stable state where BGP converges may be selected by BGP in a non-deterministic manner._"
