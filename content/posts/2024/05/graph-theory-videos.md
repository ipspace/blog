When I decided to [sunset the ipSpace.net subscription](/2023/09/lifetime-ipspace-subscription/), I asked [Rachel Traylor](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Rachel_Traylor) whether I could make the content of her webinars public. She graciously agreed, and the first results are already here: you can [download approximately half of the videos](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Graph) from the [Network Connectivity and Graph Theory](https://www.ipspace.net/Network_Connectivity,_Graph_Theory,_and_Reliable_Network_Design) without a valid ipSpace.net account. Enjoy!
