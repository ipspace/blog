Daniel Dib started writing a series of blog posts describing [Cisco vPC in VXLAN/EVPN Networks](https://lostintransit.se/2024/04/29/cisco-vpc-in-vxlan-evpn-network-part-1-anycast-vtep/). The first one covers [the anycast gateway](https://lostintransit.se/2024/04/29/cisco-vpc-in-vxlan-evpn-network-part-1-anycast-vtep/), the second one [the vPC configuration](https://lostintransit.se/2024/05/01/cisco-vpc-in-vxlan-evpn-network-part-2-configuring-vpc/).

Let's hope he will keep them coming and link them together so it will be easy to find the whole series after stumbling on one of the posts ;)
