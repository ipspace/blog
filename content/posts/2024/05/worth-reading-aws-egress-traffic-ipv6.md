AWS started charging for public IPv4 addresses a few months ago, supposedly to encourage users to move to IPv6. As it turns out, you need public IPv4 addresses (or a private link) to access many AWS services, clearly demonstrating that it's just another ~~way of fleecing the sheep~~ Hotel California tax. I'm so glad I [moved my videos to Cloudflare](/2023/08/videos-free-subscription.html) ;)

For more details, read [AWS: Egress Traffic and Using AWS Services via IPv6](https://tty.neveragain.de/2024/05/20/aws-ipv6-egress.html) (rendered in beautiful, easy-to-read teletype font).
