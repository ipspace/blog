If you insist on building your network with EBGP as a better IGP, make sure your implementation supports running IPv4 and IPv6 address families over EBGP sessions established between IPv6 link-local addresses (the functionality lovingly called *[unnumbered EBGP sessions](/2022/11/bgp-unnumbered-duct-tape.html)*).

Want to practice that neat trick? Check out the [EBGP Sessions over IPv6 LLA Interfaces](https://bgplabs.net/basic/d-interface/) lab exercise.
