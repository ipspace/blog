I mostly gave up on LLMs being any help (apart from generating copious amounts of bullshit), but I still thought that *generating summaries* might be an interesting use case. I was wrong.

As Gerben Wierda explains in his recent "*[When ChatGPT summarises, it actually does nothing of the kind](https://ea.rna.nl/2024/05/27/when-chatgpt-summarises-it-actually-does-nothing-of-the-kind/)*" blog post, you have to *understand* a text if you want to generate a useful *summary*, and that's not what LLMs do. They can generate *a shorter version of the text*, which might not focus on *the significant bits*.
