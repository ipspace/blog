<p>Facebook published their <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/360346274145943/introducing-data-center-fabric-the-next-generation-facebook-data-center-network">next-generation data center architecture</a> a few weeks ago, resulting in the expected “revolutionary approach to data center fabrics” echoes from the industry press and blogosphere.</p>
<p>In reality, they did a great engineering job using an interesting twist on pretty traditional multi-stage leaf-and-spine (or folded Clos) architecture.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>They split data center into standard pods</strong>. No surprise there, anyone aiming for easy-to-manage scale-out architecture (i.e. not so many people) is doing that – we discussed it on <a href="/2014/09/open-source-hybrid-cloud-reference/">Episode 8 of Software Gone Wild</a>, and I <a href="http://my.ipspace.net/bin/get?doc=78e38826-456a-11e4-bb0b-005056880254">described it</a> in one of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Design_Case_Studies">data center design case studies</a>. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKEkCRvWTQ">second part of this video</a> should give you a few additional ideas along the same lines.</p>
<p><strong>Inside each pod they use leaf-and-spine architecture</strong>, almost identical to what <a href="http://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Clos/D1%20-%20Leaf-and-Spine%20Clos%20Fabric%20with%20Dell%20Force10%20switches.mp4">Brad Hedlund described</a> in my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Architectures">Leaf-and-Spine Fabric Architectures</a> webinar… including the now-standard 3:1 oversubscription on the leaf switches (48 server-facing ports, four 40GE uplinks).</p>

<p class="info">Note that every fabric switch needs 48 leaf-facing 40GE ports. Adding the necessary pod-to-spine uplinks, they need 96-port 40GE switches to implement this design. I wouldn't be too surprised to see Arista launch a switch meeting these specs at the next Interop ;)</p>
<p>The interesting twist is the inter-pod connectivity. Instead of building a single non-oversubscribed core fabric, and connecting leaf nodes to it (the <a href="http://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Clos/D3%20-%20Multi-Stage%20Clos%20Fabrics%20With%20Dell%20Force10%20Switches.mp4">traditional way of building multi-stage leaf-and-spine fabrics</a>), they treat each pod fabric switch as a leaf node in another <strong>orthogonal leaf-and-spine fabric</strong> (for a total of four core fabrics), resulting in a data center fabric that can potentially support over 100.000 server ports (the limiting factor is the number of ports on the <em>spine switches</em>).</p>
