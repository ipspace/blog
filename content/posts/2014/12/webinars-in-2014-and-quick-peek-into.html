<p>I promise engineers who renew their subscription 4-6 new webinars a year. It’s time to see whether I kept that promise in 2014.</p>
<p>TL&amp;DR summary: it was a great year, but I still missed a few things.<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>The year started with a sponsored webinar describing <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Real_Life_OpenFlow_Use_Cases">OpenFlow-based SDN solutions</a> that work outside of PowerPoint;</li>
<li>In February I <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Designing_Private_Cloud_Infrastructure">started</a> the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Designing_Private_Cloud_Infrastructure#Roadmap">Designing a Private Cloud trilogy</a>.</li>
<li>March brought the last bit of IPv6 content I plan to cover: <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_High_Availability_Strategies">IPv6 High Availability</a> strategy. I don’t think there’s much more to say about IPv6 (there might be in 5 years when they get the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2010/12/small-site-multihoming-in-ipv6-mission.html">multihoming stuff</a> together) – all you have to do is go out and deploy it.</li>
<li>In April we did a <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Following_Packets_across_Overlay_Virtual_Networks">deep dive into packet flows on overlay virtual networks</a>.</li>
<li>May is the month of<a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics_Update"> Data Center Fabric Update webinars</a>. This year I did a total rewrite of Brocade, Dell, HP and Juniper sections, and included tons of new material on improvements in Arista EOS and Nexus OS. There was so much new material we had to split the session in two parts.</li>
<li>In early July Michele Chubirka did a <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/PCI_DSS_for_Engineers">great overview of PCI DSS</a>. </li>
<li>The guest speaker of late August was Matt Oswald with a <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Network_Programmability_101">fantastic introduction to network automation</a>.</li>
<li>I spent a lot of time working on SDN architectures and practical aspects of SDN this year, resulting in SDN <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN_Deployment_Considerations">Deployment Considerations webinar</a> in October.</li>
<li>Finally, Nuage Networks sponsored an interesting webinar on <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Scaling_Overlay_Virtual_Networks">overlay virtual networking scalability</a> in November.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the Data Center Fabrics update webinar, I did a few other updates and refreshes:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Enterprise_IPv6_-_the_First_Steps">Enterprise IPv6 webinar</a> in September fixed a number of minor details that changed between 2011 and 2014 (I would love to see more changes, but apart from running out of address space nothing fundamental happened in the IPv6 space in the meantime).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/VXLAN_Technical_Deep_Dive">VXLAN 2.0 webinar in October</a> was a completely different story. It was a total rewrite of the existing materials with tons of new information on controller-based VXLAN, scalability issues and hardware gateways. As is usually the case, I created too much material, so we had to split the webinar in two sessions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I managed to publish three books: <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Design_Case_Studies">Data Center Design Case Studies</a>, <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN_and_OpenFlow">SDN and OpenFlow</a>, and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Overlay_Virtual_Networks_in_Software-Defined_Data_Centers">Overlay Virtual Networks</a>.</p>
<p class="info">Oh, and don’t forget that you <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">get all these goodies for just $199 a year</a>.</p>
<p>And now for the not-so-good news:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>I planned to do an <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/OpenFlow_Deep_Dive">OpenFlow deep dive webinar</a> in December, and had to postpone it to early January. <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/11/a-month-of-sdn.html">The last month</a> (and two NSX/SDN workshops in December) resulted in a total burnout.</li>
<li>An active/active data center webinar was <a href="http://etherealmind.com/poster-eight-levels-vendor-acceptance/">roadmapped</a> for late 2014, but somehow it turned out 2014 had only 12 months. Revised plan: Q1 <del>2014</del><ins>2015</ins>.</li>
<li>I really wanted to do a VMware vSphere Networking update after the VMworld in August, but unfortunately vSphere GA slipped more than usual. Even though vSphere 6.0 was announced at VMworld, the documentation is still not online. Revised plan: 1H 2015.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other things already planned for 2015:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>At least two guest webinars on security and SDN;</li>
<li>SDN in real life webinar;</li>
<li>NFV webinar;</li>
<li>Traditional Data Center Fabrics update in May;</li>
<li>Total overhaul of Data Center 3.0 webinar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see how 2015 turns out – expect another summary report in approximately 12 months.</p>
