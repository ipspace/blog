title: Scaling Distributed Systems Is Hard

<p>Stumbled upon a <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&amp;id=2693195">hilarious description of challenges encountered when trying to scale distributed systems</a> (cluster of controllers running centralized control plane comes to mind). </p>
<p>It starts with “<em>If someone tells you that scaling out a distributed system is easy they are either lying or drunk, and possibly both</em>,” and gets better and better. Enjoy!</p>
