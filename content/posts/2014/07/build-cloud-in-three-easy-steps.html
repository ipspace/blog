title: Build a Cloud in Three Easy Steps

---

<p>Occasionally I get a question about some totally impossible implementation detail (example: <em>can we use OpenStack OVS plugin on VMware</em><em> to avoid buying NSX</em><em>?</em>). These questions are often coming from people who painted themselves into a corner and are now <a href="/2013/08/temper-your-macgyver-streak/">desperately looking for MacGyver’s shoelaces</a> to pull themselves out.</p>
<p>It’s easy to blame the engineer who tries to do the obviously impossible, but it’s often not his fault – these days a lot of technical people get pulled into the game of <em>Build a Cloud in Three Easy Steps</em>.<!--more--></p>

<p class="note">DIY aficionados who overextend themselves because “they can build the cloud” (even though they never did that before) are an obvious exception – their organization deserves the cloud they get because they let them loose.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to figure out whether to <a href="/2013/12/does-it-make-sense-to-build-new-clouds/">use overlay virtual network</a> with GRE or VXLAN encapsulation, try to grasp the big picture first:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>What services will our cloud offer?</li>
<li>Who is the customer?</li>
<li>How many customers will we have?</li>
<li>What is the expected workload size?</li>
<li>What is the expected growth?</li>
<li>Will we have multiple tenants (or <a href="/2013/11/make-every-application-independent/">applications-as-tenants</a>)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the answers to these questions, you’ll be able to figure out how big a network you need, and you <a href="/2012/11/firewalls-in-small-private-cloud/">might figure out</a> that you don’t more than two ToR switches, in which case you don’t really have a problem anymore.</p>
