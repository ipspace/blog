<p>A while ago I was listening to a CloudCast.net podcast describing Project Runway for geeks – the <a href="http://www.virtualdesignmaster.com/">Virtual Design Master</a> – and decided to do <a href="http://www.virtualdesignmaster.com/virtual-design-master-welcomes-ioshints-as-a-sponsor/">what I could to help them</a> ;)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.virtualdesignmaster.com/virtual-design-master-2-0-dates-announced/">second season is starting today</a> – the <a href="http://www.virtualdesignmaster.com/category/participants/">list of participants is already online</a> (and you might watch the <a href="http://www.virtualdesignmaster.com/episodes/">videos of the first season</a> while waiting for the first challenge).</p>
