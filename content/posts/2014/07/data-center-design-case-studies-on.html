<p>If you’re an avid Kindle user, you can buy the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Design_Case_Studies"><em>Data Center Design Case Studies</em></a><em> </em>book on Amazon. Here’s the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LEGNO4I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00LEGNO4I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=cisioshinandt-20&amp;linkId=HIIJ2EB2MWGTCTTL">Amazon.com link</a>, search should find it on most other Amazon marketplaces.</p>
<p>However, if you can survive reading the PDF version, please <a href="http://cms.ipspace.net/bin/buy?id=DCDesign">buy it straight off my web site</a>. Here’s why:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>When using the Kindle Direct Publishing, Amazon gives the author 35% or 70% of the book sales <em>as royalties</em>. The author gets 70% royalties only if the book costs less than $9.99 (and I don’t believe in 180 pages of design case studies being worth $9.99) and only for sales in certain territories.</li>
<li>There’s a 30% withholding tax on royalties earned by non-US entities on Amazon.com.</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary: Best case I’d get 35% for every book sold on Amazon (assuming I manage to win the paperwork war), right now it would be 24.5%. Leaving 75% of book price to third parties that add little value to the process seems like a colossal waste.</p>
