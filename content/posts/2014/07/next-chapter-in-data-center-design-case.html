<p>When I published the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Design_Case_Studies">Data Center Design Case Studies</a> book <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/06/just-out-data-center-design-case-studies.html">almost exactly a month ago</a>, three chapters were still missing – but that was the only way to stop the procrastination and ensure I’ll write them (I’m trying to stick to published deadlines ;).</p>
<p>The first one of the missing chapters is already finished and available to <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">subscribers</a>and everyone who <a href="http://cms.ipspace.net/bin/buy?id=DCDesign">bought the book</a> or <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Designing_Private_Cloud_Infrastructure">Designing Private Cloud Infrastructure</a> webinar (you’ll also get a mailing on Sunday to remind you to download the fresh copy of the PDF).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/07/data-center-design-case-studies-on.html">Amazon Kindle version</a> will be updated in a few days.</p>
