Networking is no different, and yet <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/03/where-is-my-vlan-provisioning.html">there aren’t that many tool builders among the networking engineers</a>… or maybe all you need is a nudge and some hints on how to get started.<!--more--></p>
<p><a href="http://lamejournal.com/">John Herbert</a> has started writing network automation tools more than 20 years ago and was willing to share his experiences in <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/www.ipSpace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_3-The_F-Script_with_John_Herbert.mp3">Episode 3</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a> in which we initially discussed his journey from simple Perl script to a distributed configuration analysis tool (<a href="http://lamejournal.com/2014/06/18/f-script-finding-ips-anywhere/">the F-script</a>, but quickly diverged into all sorts of topics including:</p>
