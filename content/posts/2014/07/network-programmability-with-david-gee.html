<p>For the second episode of Software Gone Wild I got a truly interesting guest: David Gee, a network engineer already working on numerous network programmability and orchestration deployment.</p>

<p>We also talked about multi-vendor deployments, avoiding lock-in with abstraction layers, building trust, and pre-deployment tests, so make sure you listen to the whole podcast.
