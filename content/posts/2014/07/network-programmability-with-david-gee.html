<p>For the second episode of Software Gone Wild I got a truly interesting guest: David Gee, a network engineer already working on numerous network programmability and orchestration deployment.</p>
<p>During our half-hour chat we couldn’t avoid the question of whether every networking engineer will become a programmer and David provided an interesting answer: you don’t have to program, but you’ll definitely have to start thinking more like a good programmer.<!--more--></p>
<p>We also talked about multi-vendor deployments, avoiding lock-in with abstraction layers, building trust, and pre-deployment tests, so make sure you listen to the whole podcast.
