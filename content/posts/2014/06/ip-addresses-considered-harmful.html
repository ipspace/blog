title: IP Addresses Considered Harmful

<p>A long while ago I wrote about the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/08/what-went-wrong-socket-api.html">brokenness of socket API</a> and <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2009/08/what-went-wrong-tcpip-lacks-session.html">lack of session layer in TCP/IP stack</a>. Looks like I’m not the only one with heretic opinions; Fred Baker reached similar conclusions in his <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-baker-happier-eyeballs-00">Happier Eyeballs</a> draft and Brian Carpenter recently published a long article title <a href="http://www.sigcomm.org/sites/default/files/ccr/papers/2014/April/0000000-0000008.pdf"><em>IP Addresses Considered Harmful</em></a> which documents (among other things) the history of socket API and the reasons DNS isn’t tightly integrated with it. Both documents are definitely worth reading.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you love listening to old rants, here’s a <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/X1%20-%20TCP%20Stack%20Socket%20API%20Shortcomings.mp4">video I recorded more than 3 years ago</a> (part of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Upcoming_Internet_Challenges"><em>Upcoming Internet Challenges</em></a> webinar). The truly sad part: nothing changed in the meantime.</p>
