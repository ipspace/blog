<p class="update"><b>Update 2014-06-18 05:13Z</b> - We slashdotted Christoph's site yesterday. He moved to a new server during the night; the links should work now.</p>
<p>Christoph Jaggi focused on analyzing Metro Ethernet and Carrier Ethernet encryption gear. The introductory part of <a href="http://www.uebermeister.com/files/inside-it/2014_Introduction_Encryption_Metro_and_Carrier_Ethernet.pdf">this year’s report</a> has just been published and it’s definitely worth reading even if you have no immediate plans to buy such gear – it’s a nice overview document covering numerous encryption technologies, key distribution systems, network topologies, and operational aspects. If you want to get in-depth evaluation of individual vendors or solutions, you’ll obviously have to <a href="http://www.uebermeister.com/Uebermeister/%C3%9Cber.html">contact Christoph</a>.</p>
