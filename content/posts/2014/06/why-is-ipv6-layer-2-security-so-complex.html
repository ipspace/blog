title: Why is IPv6 layer-2 security so complex (and how to fix it)
url: /2014/06/why-is-ipv6-layer-2-security-so-complex.html

<p>After the excellent IPv6 security presentation Eric Vyncke had @ 9th Slovenian IPv6 summit someone asked me: “<em>Why is IPv6 first-hop security so complex? It looks like the developers of IPv6 protocol stack tried to make users anonymous and made everyone’s life complex while doing that.</em>”</p>
<p>Well, he was totally surprised by my answer: “<em>The real reason IPv6 first-hop security is so complex is the total mess we made of L2/L3 boundary</em>.”<!--more--></p>
<h4>In the ideal world…</h4><p>Imagine a perfect world in which we use layer-2 connectivity only between the adjacent nodes (the way it was designed to be used) – the first switch your host is connected to is thus already a layer-3 switch. The security implications are staggering:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>A layer-3 switch (a device formerly known as a router) does not listen to Router Advertisements  no RA spoofing;</li>
<li>Neighbor discovery works across a layer-2 segment, not across layer-3 switches  no ND spoofing;</li>
<li>With every host being on a dedicate layer-2 segment, it’s impossible to reply to DHCPv6 requests (because a host doesn’t ever see requests from other hosts)  no DHCPv6 spoofing;</li>
<li>The layer-3 switch has authoritative forwarding information and can perform unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) checks to verify source IPv6 addresses  no IPv6 address spoofing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Won’t that explode the routing tables?</h4><p>Am I advocating using a /64 for every host? Do I look that stupid? It’s time to get creative and start using host routes:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>A single /64 prefix is advertised to all hosts in a “subnet”;</li>
<li>The prefix is advertised as <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/11/ipv6-router-advertisements-deep-dive.html">available for autoconfiguration</a> (if you want to have autoconfiguration);</li>
<li>If the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/11/ipv6-on-link-determination-what-is-it.html">layer-3 switch advertises the prefix as off-net</a>, the hosts don’t even try to use Neighbor Discovery mechanism to find the MAC addresses of other hosts, but go straight to the layer-3 switch when they have to send a packet to someone else;</li>
<li>The layer-3 switch creates a host route for every directly attached host. It can even reuse the exact same silicon used for ND entries these days (see also: <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/02/this-is-not-host-route-youre-looking-for.html">that’s not the host route route you’re looking for</a>).</li>
<li>You could configure those host routes manually (in high-security environment), allow DHCPv6 proxy to do its job (interesting, this code is already available in Cisco IOS), or create a host route out of an DAD message if you decide to trust the hosts and the IPv6 autoconfiguration process.</li>
<li>The switch may redistribute those host routes into whatever routing protocol it’s using (might be needed in multihomed environments) or advertise the /64 prefix into the rest of the network and let the more-specific-prefix forwarding take care of the rest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the above functionality is already available in layer-3 switches with reasonably good IPv6 support (read: not many of them), the only missing bit is the host route creation based on DAD messages (effectively reinventing <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/08/mobile-arp-in-enterprise-networks.html">Mobile ARP</a> or <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/08/enterasys-host-routing-optimal-l3.html">Enterasys’ Host Routing</a>).</p>
<p>Will we see a daring switch vendor who’ll break the ancient bad habits and start using the hardware they already have (most high-speed switches already have L3 hardware) in a slightly more creative way, or will <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/12/hyper-v-network-virtualization-packet.html">Microsoft remain the only one with the guts to say “<em>stop the layer-2 stupidities</em>”</a>? Being the pessimist that I am, I’d bet Microsoft will be very lonely in the IPv6 L3-only world for quite a while, but do prove me wrong in the comments!</p>
<h4>Speaking of IPv6 security</h4><p>I did an <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_security">IPv6 security webinar</a> with Eric Vyncke 18 months ago, and it’s as relevant as ever (particularly considering the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/09/state-of-ipv6-in-data-center-gear.html">dismal level of first-hop IPv6 security support in hardware- or virtual switches</a>).</p>
