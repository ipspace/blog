title: IP Addresses Considered Harmful
url: /2014/06/ip-addresses-considered-harmful.html
---
A long while ago, I wrote about the [brokenness of socket API](/2009/08/what-went-wrong-socket-api.html) and [lack of session layer in TCP/IP stack](/2009/08/what-went-wrong-tcpip-lacks-session.html).

It looks like I'm not the only one with heretic opinions; Fred Baker reached similar conclusions in his [Happier Eyeballs](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-baker-happier-eyeballs-00) draft and Brian Carpenter recently published a lengthy article title [*IP Addresses Considered Harmful*](http://www.sigcomm.org/sites/default/files/ccr/papers/2014/April/0000000-0000008.pdf) which documents (among other things) the history of socket API and the reasons DNS isn't tightly integrated with it. Both documents are definitely worth reading.
