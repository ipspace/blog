<p>One of my readers sent me this question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I am a CCNP-certified L3/L4 network engineer working purely on Cisco products and network technologies for the last 10 years of experience. How long will it take for a typical person like me to get a foothold into VM/SAN?</blockquote>
<p>It obviously depends on how deep you want to go, but the virtual networking part of it shouldn’t be too hard.<!--more--></p>
<p>After all, the virtual machines running in hypervisors (or applications running in <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/05/what-are-linux-containers.html">Docker containers</a>) expect to see <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2010/07/tcpip-is-like-mainframe-you-cant-change.html">the same TCP/IP stack</a> and <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2010/07/bridges-kludge-that-shouldnt-exist.html">Ethernet interfaces</a> they used while they were still residing on dedicated silicon, and the networking technology fundamentals haven’t changed in the 30 years, so it’s no surprise you’ll find a <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/12/vmware-vswitch-baseline-of-simplicity.html">VLAN-capable layer-2 switch in most hypervisors</a>.</p>
<p>For more details, watch the Virtual Switch 101 video from my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Virtualized_Networking"><em>Introduction to Virtual Networking</em></a> webinar (which, BTW, is a great place to start if you want to migrate from pure physical networking to virtual- or overlay networking)</p>
