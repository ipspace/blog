<p>Some of the comments I get every time I write about the idea of <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/11/typical-enterprise-application.html">merging network services deployment with application deployments</a>, and <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/they-want-networking-to-be-utility-lets.html">making application developers responsible for the results of their code</a> (aka DevOps) remind me of a very long list of “<em>this will never work</em>” sentiments I encountered in the 30 years I spent in IT and networking. Here are just a few of them:<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite">Mission-critical applications will never run on Unix hosts. IBM and Tandem are the only platforms that are reliable enough to handle them.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="cite">Unix will never run reliably on x86 hardware. That’s the hardware I use at home; we need something better for the server room.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="cite">Windows? That’s the thing I run on my desktop. And now you want to have that thing on a server?</blockquote>
<blockquote class="cite">Routers? Get lost, that’s for the academics. I trust my SNA network.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="cite">SNA-over-IP? That will never work. IP-over-SNA probably makes sense, but SNA-over-IP? We would lose all control over the end-to-end QoS.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="cite">Selling things over Internet? It won’t work; people will never send their credit card information over the Internet.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="cite">Using Internet in tourism makes no sense – most holidays are booked by women, and a typical Internet user is a man in mid 20es (I’m not making it up – I actually heard this one).</blockquote>
<blockquote class="cite">Voice-over-IP? Too bandwidth-consuming… and you’ll never get the QoS you need for carrier-grade voice experience.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="cite">Ethernet? No, it’s non-deterministic. I’ll stick to Token Ring.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="cite">Ethernet in carrier networks? Never. It might be good enough for LANs, but we’ll stay with ATM over SDH (or SONET).</blockquote>
<blockquote class="cite">Trusting the service provider to run my WAN? I could never do that – Frame Relay is sort-of-OK (but I prefer channelized E1/T1), MPLS/VPN is out of question.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="cite">Building my corporate WAN over the Internet? What were you smoking? I’ll stay with the MPLS/VPN.</blockquote>
<p>In every single case “<em>the </em><em>thing that will never worked</em>” eventually started to work, became successful (because it was just-good-enough at a low-enough price), and effectively strangled “<em>the best thing ever invented</em>”… and the people who claimed it will never work grudgingly accepted it and started yammering about the next impossible transition. Lather, rinse, repeat.</p>
<h4>Shall we just embrace every new technology?</h4><p>Obviously not – after all, we’re <a href="http://archive.psg.com/051000.sigcomm-ivtf.pdf">the wall used by the vendors to see which pasta sticks</a> – but it’s also irresponsible to say “<em>this will never work</em>” and continue burning other people’s money doing things the same broken way (let’s be honest, that’s what we’re doing <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/03/what-did-you-do-to-get-rid-of-manual.html">configuring VLANs</a> for the last 20 years).</p>
<p>What you should do instead is:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Evaluate whether the new technology makes sense from the architectural and technology perspective. There are some things that are evidently broken (ATM-to-the-desktop and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/10/openflow-and-state-explosion.html">OpenFlow-based global load balancing</a> come to mind). Also, never trust industry press, high-level consultants and vendor white papers – after all, those same people <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/10/follow-sun-workload-mobility-get-lost.html">evangelized the beauty of follow-the-sun VM mobility</a>;</li>
<li>Figure out whether the new technology has a fighting chance to address a business problem faced by your organization, or improve the IT processes;</li>
<li>Learn more about the new technology;</li>
<li>Set up a pilot (potentially working with like-minded people from other IT groups, ranging from application developers to networking and storage engineers);</li>
<li>Whenever a pilot fails, learn from the mistakes, fix them, and repeat the pilot;</li>
<li>Use the results of the pilot(s) to dismiss the technology, shelve it until it matures, or slowly adopt it for new deployments.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, whatever you decide to do, don’t be the Department of No. </p>
