title: Snabb Switch and NFV on OpenStack in Software Gone Wild

<p>Last September I received a peculiar tweet from Luke Gorrie pointing me to a software switch <a href="https://twitter.com/lukego/status/327714050219847680">pushing 200 Gbps through an Intel server</a> literally hours after I’d watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUebF3UJiU4">Deutsche Telekom Terastream presentation</a>, so I mentioned <a href="http://snabb.co/">Luke’s Snabb Switch</a> as a potential performance solution in an email to Ian Farrer… and before Ian managed to reply, Luke was already working for Deutsche Telekom.<!--more--></p>
<p>A few weeks back Luke <a href="http://snabb.co/nfv.html">published an update on his software project</a>. Snabb Switch will become part of OpenStack, and Luke claimed his switch could push 60 Gbps through VM appliances in an OpenStack environment – an excellent reason to chat with him about the progress he has made in the last year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an offhand remark planted a crazy idea in my brains – a podcast focusing on real-life SDN, NFV and SDDC architectures and solutions that work outside of the cozy environment of vendor-branded PowerPoint. Jason Edelman helped me with the name, and so the <strong>Software Gone Wild </strong>podcast was born, with Luke Gorrie and Simon Leinen starring in its pilot episode.</p>
