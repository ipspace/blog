<p>After months of being on a back burner, my first self-publishing book is out: <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Design_Case_Studies"><em>Data Center Design Case Studies</em></a> are available on my web site (Amazon Kindle version coming whenever I find time to figure out all the details).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">Subscribers</a> can download the book immediately (you’ll find it in the new <em>Books </em>section), as can anyone who bought the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Designing_Private_Cloud_Infrastructure"><em>Designing Private Cloud Infrastructure</em></a> webinar (you’ll find it in the webinar materials), and you can <a href="http://cms.ipspace.net/bin/buy?id=DCDesign">buy a copy on my web site</a>.</p>
