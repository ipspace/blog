<p>I found two interesting data center/virtualization blogs this week (can’t remember the last time I found two new blogs in a week):</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><a href="http://pedrormarques.wordpress.com/">Pedro Marques’ blog</a> – it focuses primarily on Open Contrail, but you’ll find interesting gems questioning the wisdom of OpenFlow and Segment Routing (among other things);</li>
<li><a href="http://aldrinisaac.blogspot.com/">Aldrin Isaac’s blog</a> – unfortunately he stopped writing in the last months, but some of his older posts are pure gold.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy – and poke Aldrin to continue writing ;)</p>
