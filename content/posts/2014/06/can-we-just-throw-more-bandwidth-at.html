title: Can We Just Throw More Bandwidth at a Problem?

<p>One of my readers sent me an interesting question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I have been reading at many places about "throwing more bandwidth at the problem." How far is this statement valid? Should the applications(servers) work with the assumption that there is infinite bandwidth provided at the fabric level?</blockquote>
<p>Moore’s law works in our favor. It’s already cheaper (in some environments) to add bandwidth than to deploy QoS.<!--more--></p>
<p>Data center networks are a prime example. With <a href="http://www.arista.com/blogs/?p=867">prices of 10GE ports in $200 - $300 range</a> it makes no sense to deploy QoS and incur <a href="/2013/11/technical-debt-and-how-we-can-fix-it/">perpetual technical debt</a>. A single data center fabric should provide equidistant endpoints – you should be able to get the same amount of bandwidth between any two endpoints (whether you get linerate bandwidth or a fraction of it due to leaf-to-spine oversubscription is a different discussion that depends on the needs of your workload).</p>
<p>If you want to have some redundancy in your data center, you might want to <a href="/2014/02/keep-your-failure-domains-small/">build more than one availability zone</a> (just make sure you don’t bridge across multiple zones, <a href="/2012/05/layer-2-network-is-single-failure/">turning them in a single failure domain</a>). Should you provide the same bandwidth between endpoints in the same availability zone and across availability zones? It depends on the workload needs and your budget, but it’s still a feasible idea.</p>
<p>WAN bandwidth is orders of magnitude more expensive than LAN bandwidth, so it’s impossible to just throw more bandwidth at a problem. QoS might temporarily alleviate some bottlenecks, but it’s a zero-sum game, and <a href="http://www.internetsociety.org/sites/default/files/QoS%20Huston%20June%202012.pdf">large-scale QoS never worked well</a>.</p>
<p class="info">Flow-based forwarding and other ideas promoted by OpenFlow evangelists are just QoS in disguise.</p>
<p>If you want to solve the WAN bandwidth challenges, you have to start with the application architecture – once the application architects figure out the laws of physics (including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light">upper bound on information propagation speed</a>) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_Distributed_Computing">fallacies of distributed computing</a>, and start architecting the applications with real-life bandwidth and latency in mind, everyone’s life becomes much simpler.</p>
