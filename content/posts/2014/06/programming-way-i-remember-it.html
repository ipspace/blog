<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/jure-spiler/6/145/571">Jure Špiler</a>, an old friend of mine (and my first boss) sent me a link to a fantastic YouTube video documenting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV-7J5y1TQc&amp;list=PL1C8B2E1355D3613B&amp;index=1">how we did programming on PDP-11 computers</a> when I started my programming career (note: I did not enter compiled assembly code with console switches on PDP-11, but I did do that on an 6800-based box with 2K of RAM).</p>
<p>Related videos tab revealed another gem: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK99WuaU_k8">PDP-11/34 with RL-01 disk drives</a> – the very same system where I started my IT career as a high-school kid. Enjoy!</p>
