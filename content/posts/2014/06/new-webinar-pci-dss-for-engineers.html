<p>Every now and then I get a complaint that someone cannot buy the webinar subscription because I’m using Google Wallet to process the credit card transactions. There’s a single reason I’m using Google Wallet: I’m trying to stay as far away as possible from the morass called PCI DSS.<!--more--></p>
<p>Fortunately I know people that can bring fresh air to the foggy everglades of credit card handling. Michele Chubirka (better known as <a href="http://packetpushers.net/author/securityprincess/">Mrs Y</a>) does a fantastic job explaining the intricacies of PCI DSS to engineers (using Alice in Wonderland drawings to illustrate them) – the audience <a href="http://blog.interop.com/2014/04/25/top-rated-speakers-from-interop-las-vegas-2104/">rated her PCI DSS presentation @ Interop Las Vegas among the top 10 presentations of the whole event</a>. She was kind enough to agree to do an ipSpace.net webinar on PCI DSS on July 2<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">nd</span> (<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pci-dss-for-engineers-tickets-11710314867?ref=ebapi">register here</a>), and promised to give you as many down-to-earth tips and tricks as possible. </p>
<p>If your company processes credit cards, or plans to do so, you simply have to attend this webinar – it will give you the survival skills you’ll need when dealing with self-assessments or PCI DSS auditors.</p>
