---

<p>The first part of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Real_Life_OpenFlow-based_SDN_Use_Cases">Real-life OpenFlow Use Cases</a> webinar focused on controller design and implementation choices that can significantly impact the scalability of an OpenFlow solution:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/03/controller-based-packet-forwarding-in.html">Proactive versus reactive flow setup</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/10/forwarding-models-in-openflow-networks.html">Hop-by-hop versus path-based forwarding</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/10/flow-table-explosion-with-openflow-10.html">State explosion with OpenFlow 1.0</a>;</li>
</ul>
<p>You could tell we had great fun with these topics: we spent more than half an hour on five slides.</p>
