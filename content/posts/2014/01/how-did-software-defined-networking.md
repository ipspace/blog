title: How Did Software Defined Networking Start?

*Software-Defined Networking* is clearly a tautological term -- after all, software defined networking device behavior ever since we stopped using Token Ring MAUs and unmanaged hubs. Open Networking Foundation [claims it owns the definition of the term](https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-definition) (which makes approximately as much sense as someone claiming they own the definition of *red-colored clouds*), but I was always wondering who coined the term in the first place.

I finally found the answer in a [fantastic overview of technologies and ideas that led to OpenFlow and SDN](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2560327) published in [December 2013 issue of acmqueue](http://queue.acm.org/issuedetail.cfm?issue=2559899). According to that article, SDN first appeared in an [article published by MIT Technology Review](http://www2.technologyreview.com/article/412194/tr10-software-defined-networking/) that explains how Nick McKeown and his team at Stanford use OpenFlow:

> Frustrated by this inability to fiddle with Internet routing in the real world, Stanfor­d computer scientist Nick McKeow­n and colleagues developed a standard called OpenFlow that essentially opens up the Internet to researchers, allowing them to define data flows using software\--a sort of \"software-defined networking.\"

You did notice the "a sort of" classification and quotes around SDN, didn't you? It's pretty obvious how the article uses "software-defined networking" to illustrate the point... but once marketing took over all hope for reasonable discussion was lost, and SDN became even more meaningless as cloud.
