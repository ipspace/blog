<p>A few days ago I described how <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/12/control-plane-in-openflow-networks.html">most OpenFlow data center fabric solutions use out-of-band control plane</a> (separate control-plane network). Can we do something similar when running OpenFlow switch (example: Open vSwitch) in a hypervisor host?</p>
<p><strong>TL&amp;DR answer</strong>: Sure we can. Does it make sense? It depends.<!--more--></p>
<p class="note">Open vSwitch supports <a href="http://git.openvswitch.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=openvswitch;a=blob;f=DESIGN;h=4d654d01d7b140a32e5974f7d0c7a08f6b5aa800;hb=HEAD#l599">in-band control plane</a>, but that’s not the focus of this post.</p>
<p>If you buy servers with a half dozen interfaces (I wouldn't), then it makes perfect sense to follow the usual design best practices published by hypervisor vendors, and allocate a pair of interfaces to user traffic, another pair to management/control plane/vMotion traffic, and a third pair to storage traffic. Problem solved.</p>

<p>Buying servers with two 10GE uplinks (what I would do) definitely makes your cabling friend happy, and reduces the overall networking costs, but does result in slightly more interesting hypervisor configuration.</p>
<p>Best case, you split the 10GE uplinks into multiple virtual uplink NICs (example: Cisco/s Adapter FEX, Broadcom's <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/collateral/wp/Virtualization-WP100-R.pdf">NIC Embedded Switch</a>, or SR-IOV) and transform the problem into a known problem (see above) … but what if you're stuck with two physical uplinks?</p>

<h4>Overlay Virtual Networks to the Rescue</h4><p>If you implement all virtual networks (used by a particular hypervisor host) with overlay virtual networking technology, you don't have a problem. The virtual switch in the hypervisor (for example, OVS) has no external connectivity; it just generates IP packets that have to be sent across the transport network. The uplinks are thus used for control-plane traffic and encapsulated user traffic - the OpenFlow switch is never touching the physical uplinks.</p>

<h4>Integrating OpenFlow Switch with Physical Network</h4><p>Finally, there's the scenario where an OpenFlow-based virtual switch (usually OVS) provides VLAN-based switching, and potentially interferes with control-plane traffic running over shared uplinks. Most products solve this challenge by somehow inserting the control-plane TCP stack in parallel with the OpenFlow switch. </p>

<p>For example, OVS Neutron agent creates a dedicated bridge for each uplink, and connects OVS uplinks and the host TCP/IP stack to the physical uplinks through the per-interface bridge. That setup ensures the control-plane traffic continues to flow even when a bug in Neutron agent or OVS breaks VM connectivity across OVS.
