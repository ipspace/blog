<p>Ed Horley wrote another great post arguing <a href="http://www.howfunky.com/2013/12/follow-up-to-my-ipv6-and-ula-post-plus.html">you don’t need Unique Local Addresses in an IPv6 network</a> … and I couldn’t figure out what the problem was until I got the underlying context: it seems many engineers try to transplant their IPv4 mentality into IPv6 world and see ULAs as a nice replacement for RFC1918 with <a href="http://www.howfunky.com/2013/12/ipv6-nat66-and-nptv6-it-seems-there-is.html">NAT66 or NPT66 on the private network edge</a>. No wonder Ed argues against that.<!--more--></p>
<p>While we still <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/09/to-ula-or-not-to-ula-thats-question.html">cannot escape the throes of NAT66/NPT66</a>, you shouldn’t use ULAs as 1:1 RFC1918 replacement. Remember that every IPv6 host has more than one IPv6 address per interface. One of those addresses might be an ULA address (for intra-company communication), another one a public (PI or PA) IPv6 address (for global connectivity). </p>
<p>Using ULAs in combination with public IPv6 addresses is <a href="http://www.howfunky.com/2013/12/follow-up-to-my-ipv6-and-ula-post-plus.html">identical to the solutions Ed proposed in his blog post</a> (see Figure 5 in his post), with a crucial difference: Ed’s solution requires you to modify <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6724">IPv6 source address selection prefix policy entries</a>, while ULA+global combination (usually) works with the default settings of most operating systems.</p>
