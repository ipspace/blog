<p>Enno Rey (the mastermind behind the <a href="https://www.troopers.de/">Troopers</a> conference) and myself got a cunning plan during one of the <a href="/2013/05/troopers-13-must-visit-security.html">Troopers 2013</a> dinners – we’d have an <a href="#Security_SDN">SDN &amp; Security presentation at Troopers 2014</a>. </p>
<p>As always, Enno exceeded my wildest expectations, and offered me to have a <a href="https://www.troopers.de/troopers14/troopers14-1-day-workshop-sdn-openflow-and-nfv-hype-and-reality/index.html">full-day SDN workshop</a> during this year’s conference – an offer I simply couldn’t refuse.</p>
<p>SDN, security, IPv6, Heidelberg, fantastic presenters and audience, great organizers – it can’t get any better … all you have to do is <a href="https://www.troopers.de/sign-up/index.html">register</a>.</p>
