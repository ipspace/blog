<p>From the <em>IPv6 Trivia</em> department: can a host with an ULA address reach a service with a global IPv6 address? Can a host with only a link-local address reach a service with a global IPv6 address? The answer to both questions might be <em>Yes</em> (but you better know what <a href="http://njetwork.wordpress.com/2014/01/19/ipv6-scopes-and-zones/">scopes and zones</a> are if you want to figure it out).</p>
