title: Complex Routing in Hyper-V Network Virtualization

<p>The <a href="/2013/12/hyper-v-network-virtualization-packet.html">layer-3-only Hyper-V Network Virtualization forwarding model</a> implemented in <a href="/2013/08/whats-coming-in-hyper-v-network.html">Windows Server 2012 R2</a> thoroughly confuses engineers used to deal with traditional layer-2 subnets connected via layer-3 switches.</p>
<p>As always, it helps to take a few steps back, focus on the principles, and the “unexpected” behavior becomes crystal clear.</p>
<p class="update">2014-02-05: HNV routing details updated based on feedback from Praveen Balasubramanian. Thank you!<!--more--></p>
<h4>Sample network</h4><p>Let’s start with a virtual network that’s a bit more complex than a single VLAN:</p>
<div class="separator"><a href="/2014/01/s1600-HNV_L3_Subnets.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="/2014/01/s400-HNV_L3_Subnets.png"/></a></div>
<p>Next, assume the following connectivity requirements:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>VM A must use the gateway (GW - for example a Vyatta router-in-a-VM) to communicate with the outside world;</li>
<li>VM B and VM X must communicate.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s obvious we need a router (aka L3 switch) to link the two segments otherwise B and X cannot communicate). In a traditional VLAN-based network you’d use a physical layer-3 switch with SVI/VLAN interfaces somewhere in the network to connect the two VLANs; you could use a VM-based router in a layer-2 overlay virtual network world like VXLAN.</p>
<div class="separator"><a href="/2014/01/s1600-HNV_L3_Router.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="/2014/01/s400-HNV_L3_Router.png"/></a></div>
<p>There are at least two ways to achieve the desired connectivity in a traditional layer-2 world:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Set the default gateway to <em>router </em>(.1) on B and X, and set the default gateway to .250 (GW) on A. Pretty bad design if I’ve ever seen one.</li>
<li>Set the default gateway to <em>router </em>(.1) on all VMs (apart from the gateway VM) and configure a static default route pointing to .250 (GW) on the <em>router</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Distributed routing in Hyper-V Network Virtualization</h4><p>Hyper-V Network Virtualization (HNV) doesn’t have layer-2 segments. Every VM is directly connected to the distributed layer-3 switch (implemented in all hypervisors). The virtual network topology thus looks like this:</p>
<div class="separator"><a href="/2014/01/s1600-HNV_L3_Distributed.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="/2014/01/s400-HNV_L3_Distributed.png"/></a></div>
<p class="info">Even though HNV documentation talks about subnets and prefixes, that’s not how the forwarding works. HNV forwarding works like a router with the same IP address on all interfaces (in the same subnet) having an equivalent of a host route (<em><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj884243.aspx">NetVirtualizationLookupRecord</a></em>)for every connected VM.</p>
<p>After redrawing the diagram it’s obvious what needs to be configured to get the desired connectivity:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Set the default gateway to the distributed router (.1) on all VMs;</li>
<li>Configure a default route in the HNV environment with the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj884249.aspx">New-NetVirtualizationCustomerRoute PowerShell cmdlet</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, Windows Server 2012 R2 requires the external gateway to be in a separate subnet. The GW VM should be moved from 10.0.1.0/24 into a different subnet (for example, 10.0.2.0/24), resulting in the following Hyper-V network virtualization routing table: <style>.fmtTable td p { margin: 0.1em 0.1em; }</style><table class="fmtTable"><tr class="TRFirst"><th class="TDHead" valign="top">Prefix</th><th class="TDHead" valign="top">Next-hop</th></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>10.0.1.0/24</p>
</td><td valign="top"><p>On-link</p>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>10.0.2.0/24</p>
</td><td valign="top"><p>On-link</p>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>10.1.2.0/24</p>
</td><td valign="top"><p>On-link</p>
</td></tr><tr class="TRLast"><td class="TDLast" valign="top"><p>0.0.0.0/0</p>
</td><td class="TDLast" valign="top"><p>10.0.2.250</p>
</td></tr></table> <h4>But I lost my precious security</h4><p>I’m positive someone will start complaining at this point. In the pretty bad design I mentioned above VM B couldn’t communicate with the outside world (unless the router connecting the two segments had a default route pointing to <em>GW</em> VM), and it’s impossible to achieve the same effect with routing in HNV environment.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that security through obscurity is never a good idea (told you it was a bad design), and there’s a good reason routers and layer-3 switches have ACLs. Speaking of ACLs, you can configure them in Hyper-V with the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj554908.aspx">New-NetFirewallRule</a> and since all VM ports are equivalent (there are no layer-2 and layer-3 ports) you get consistent results regardless of whether the source and destination VM are in the same or different subnets.</p>
