<p><em>Software-Defined Networking </em>is clearly a tautological term – after all, software defined networking device behavior ever since we stopped using Token Ring MAUs and unmanaged hubs. Open Networking Foundation <a href="https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/sdn-definition">claims it owns the definition of the term</a> (which makes approximately as much sense as someone claiming they own the definition of <em>red-colored clouds</em>), but I was always wondering who coined the term in the first place.<!--more--></p>
<p>I finally found the answer in a <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2560327">fantastic overview of technologies and ideas that led to OpenFlow and SDN</a> published in <a href="http://queue.acm.org/issuedetail.cfm?issue=2559899">December 2013 issue of acmqueue</a>. According to that article, SDN first appeared in an <a href="http://www2.technologyreview.com/article/412194/tr10-software-defined-networking/">article published by MIT Technology Review</a> that explains how Nick McKeown and his team at Stanford use OpenFlow:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Frustrated by this inability to fiddle with Internet routing in the real world, Stanfor­d computer scientist Nick McKeow­n and colleagues developed a standard called OpenFlow that essentially opens up the Internet to researchers, allowing them to define data flows using software--a sort of "software-defined networking." </blockquote>
<p>You did notice the “a sort of” classification and quotes around SDN, didn’t you? It’s pretty obvious how the article uses “software-defined networking” to illustrate the point… but once marketing took over all hope for reasonable discussion was lost, and SDN became even more meaningless as cloud.</p>
