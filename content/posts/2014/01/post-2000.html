<p>When I started blogging in 2006, I had no idea that I’d still be doing it 8 years later… and I never dreamed of writing my 2000<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span> post (this one, according to my blogging platform).</p>
<p class="separator"><img border="0" src="/2014/01/s1600-Cake_2000.png"/><br/>A virtual cake I got from my lovely daughter ;)<!--more--></p>
<p>Two things kept me going – my fascination with networking technologies and your incredible support, from intriguing questions to encouraging emails and an occasional <em>Thank you! </em>comment. Thank you!</p>
<p>Finally, special thanks to my family, who never complained too loudly when I disappeared into my den to write another blog post, and Stephen Foskett and his merry band of bloggers – I would never meet so many great people without Stephen’s <a href="http://techfieldday.com/">Tech Field Day</a> idea.</p>
