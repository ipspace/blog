Someone left the [following comment](/2013/05/the-dangers-of-ignoring-ipv6.html?showComment=1387696266904#c2404843566055236044) on one of my blog posts a few days ago:

> IPv6 to a network engineer is like Communism to a Marxist. It would come in such a distant future that it would be in a form we can barely picture accurately. \[...\] So my money is on NAT444, at least in the US.

Meanwhile on planet Earth (in 2014):
<!--more-->
-   More than [2.5% of Internet users use IPv6 to reach Google](http://www.google.com/ipv6/statistics.html) and the growth seems to be exponential;
-   6.15% of US customers (and 11% of Swiss customers) use IPv6 to reach Google. [APNIC reports](http://www.potaroo.net/stats/1x1/) a bit higher number ([more than 7%](http://www.potaroo.net/stats/1x1/6v6dspref.png))
-   60% of US transit autonomous systems run IPv6, and 40% of the US content (weighted based on Alexa index) is reachable over IPv6 (source: [Cisco's IPv6 statistics](http://6lab.cisco.com/stats/));
-   Almost 20% of autonomous systems in RIPE region, and 13% of AS in ARIN region [advertise IPv6 prefixes](http://v6asns.ripe.net/v/6);
-   [464XLAT](/2013/04/464xlat-explained.html) is included in Android 4.4 and [T-Mobile uses IPv6-only connectivity](http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/TMobile-Goes-IPv6-Only-on-Android-44-Devices-126506) for mobile users with the new phones (464XLAT makes [Skype work over IPv6-only networks](http://www.internetsociety.org/deploy360/blog/2013/11/skype-on-android-works-over-ipv6-on-mobile-networks-using-464xlat/)).

We're getting close to the point where [content providers ignoring IPv6 will get penalized](/2011/03/you-cant-ignore-ipv6-any-longer-in.html), and some engineers are bound to face the five stages of IPv6 grief. Do keep in mind that a [proper IPv6 deployment takes anywhere from 6 months to 3 years](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbiB4teNT0c).

### How Do I Get Started?

I created [numerous IPv6 webinars](http://www.ipspace.net/Roadmap/IPv6_webinars) to help you design and deploy IPv6 in your network, and if you're looking for free resources, you'll find plenty of them on the Internet:

-   I created [several IPv6-focused presentations](http://www.ipspace.net/Presentations#IPv6) for Slovenian IPv6 summits;
-   [RIPE](http://www.ripe.net/lir-services/resource-management/allocations-and-assignments/request-ipv6) and [ARIN](https://www.arin.net/knowledge/ipv6_info_center.html) have created numerous IPv6-specific documents;
-   Internet Society (ISOC) has [IPv6-specific Deploy360 program](http://www.internetsociety.org/deploy360/ipv6/) that includes tutorials, case studies and training.
