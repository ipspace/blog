<p>When OpenFlow was still fresh and exciting, someone made quite a name for himself by <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/10/openflow-and-state-explosion.html">proposing a global load-balancing solution</a> that would install per-session OpenFlow entries in every core switch around the world. <a href="http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/2011/05/20/SoftwareLoadBalancingUsingSoftwareDefinedNetworking.aspx">Clearly a great idea</a>, mimicking the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2009/06/what-went-wrong-atm.html">best experiences we had with ATM SVCs</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile some people started using OpenFlow in real-life networks for <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/6%20-%20Scale-out%20Load%20Balancing.mp4">coarse-grained load balancing</a> that improves the scalability of stateful network services. For more details, watch the video recorded during the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Real_Life_OpenFlow-based_SDN_Use_Cases"><em>Real Life OpenFlow-based SDN Use Cases</em></a> webinar.</p>
