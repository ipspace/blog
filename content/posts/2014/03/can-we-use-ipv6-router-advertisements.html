<p><a href="http://www.howfunky.com/">Ed Horley</a> opened another <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/02/first-hop-load-balancing-in-ipv6.html?showComment=1392313737153#c3460408601104655638">juicy can of worms</a> in a comment to my <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/02/first-hop-load-balancing-in-ipv6.html"><em>First-Hop Load Balancing in IPv6</em></a> post: can we use IPv6 RA for fast failover (and high availability)?</p>
<p><strong>TL&amp;DR summary</strong>: it depends.<!--more--></p>
<h4>RA-based fast failure detection</h4><p>IPv6 <a href="#section-4.2">router advertisements messages</a> contain <em>router lifetime </em>field (measured in seconds). Using a one-second lifetime might be questionable due to host IPv6 stack implementation details, but two seconds should be a very reasonable value. </p>
<p>Cisco IOS can <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ipv6/command/reference/ipv6_book/ipv6_07.html#wp2360551">send RA messages every few milliseconds</a> (300 msec RA interval should be good enough for 1 second lifetime). Problem solved (unless your application needs sub-second failover)… and <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2011/apr/18/ipv6-neighbor-discovery-high-availability/">it actually works</a>. However…</p>
<h4>Maybe we should stick with FHRP</h4><p>Ignoring for the moment the fact that very short RA interval burns CPU cycles on every host attached to the IPv6 subnet (which is OK in campus networks where <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mickens/theslowwinter.pdf">users don’t know what to do with 8 cores in their laptops anyway</a>, but maybe not in a large server subnet), there’s another gotcha: IPv6 forwarding across MLAG-enabled switches.</p>
<p>Imagine two layer-3 switches in an MLAG group (example: Cisco’s VPC). Even though these two switches appear as a single entity to LACP neighbors, they still have independent MAC addresses and IPv6 link-local addresses. Each switch advertises itself using its IPv6 LLA, and the hosts in the attached subnet choose one or both of them as the first-hop router… but both IPv6 LLA appear to be reachable over the same LAG to attached hosts or layer-2 switches.</p>

<p>Off-link traffic sent to one or the other router (layer-3 switch) will thus take any one of the uplinks (based on the packet’s ECMP hash value) and will land at the wrong switch half of the time, resulting in overloaded inter-switch link (best case) or dropped traffic (worst case).</p>
<p>To make IPv6 work across layer-3 switches configured as an MLAG group you have to use the same tricks you did with IPv4: <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/06/arista-eos-virtual-arp-varp-behind.html">virtual ARP</a> on Arista EOS (it works with IPv4 and IPv6) or <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/08/optimal-layer-3-forwarding-with.html">active-active VRRP</a> or <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/6_x/nx-os/unicast/configuration/guide/l3_cli_nxos/l3_hsrp.html">HSRP</a> on most other platforms.</p>
