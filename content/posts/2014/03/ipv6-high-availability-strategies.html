<p>IPv6 is almost a direct replacement for IPv4, so it should be a no-brainer to implement high-availability services on top of IPv6 once you get the basic IPv6 end-to-end connectivity… until you start digging into dirty details as I did while preparing for the IPv6 High Availability Strategies workshop I’m running in a week @ <a href="https://www.troopers.de/index.html">Troopers 14</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>Here are just a few caveats you have to consider:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>IPv6 address configuration mechanisms and their security implications;</li>
<li>First-hop high availability – router advertisements or VRRP?</li>
<li>First-hop load balancing (GLBP tricks no longer work);</li>
<li>Dual-stack access and dual-stack load balancer considerations (particularly SLB64 or SLB46);</li>
<li>Potential brokenness of dual stack client and server environments (not every application uses happy eyeballs);</li>
</ul>
