<p>When Enno Rey mentioned RFC 6106 support (<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/02/dhcpv6slaacra-dhcpv4.html">why does it matter?</a>) on Cisco IOS during the <a href="https://www.ernw.de/download/TROOPERS_IPv6SecSummit_ERNW_IPv6_Structural_Deficits.pdf">opening presentation</a> of <a href="https://www.troopers.de/troopers14/troopers14-ipv6-security-summit-2014/index.html">Troopers 2014 IPv6 security summit</a> I got interested but remained a bit skeptical. When Eric Vyncke (sitting in the audience) started nodding, I knew it must be there. Finding the feature in IOS documentation turned out to be mission impossible.<!--more--></p>
<p>First try: Google for “RFC 6106 Cisco IOS”. Got a number of hits on Cisco Support Community (and an <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/01/ipv6-nd-managed-config-flag-is-just.html">old blog post of mine</a>), all of them yammering about lack of RFC 6106 support. Also found a new buzzword to look for: RDNSS.</p>
<p>Second try: Google for “RDNSS Cisco IOS”. Same results.</p>
<p>Third try: “RDNSS site:cisco.com” and “RFC 6106 site:cisco.com”. No better</p>
<p>Time to dig into the documentation. IPv6 configuration guides were not exactly useful – no mention of RA and DNS in the same sentence.</p>
<p>Gateway of last resort: IPv6 command reference for IOS XE (IOS XE is usually the first one to get the cool features). I guessed the new gem must be hidden somewhere in the <strong>ipv6 nd ra </strong>configuration. BINGO! RFC 6106 support is available in IOS XE 3.9S and later and <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipv6/command/ipv6-cr-book/ipv6-i3.html#wp3800310030">configured with <strong>ipv6 nd ra dns server </strong><strong><em>address</em></strong><strong> </strong>interface configuration command</a>.</p>
<p>Of course I had to try to figure out where my other searches went wrong, so I <a href="http://tools.cisco.com/search/results/en/us/get#q=ipv6+nd+ra+dns+server">searched for “ipv6 nd ra dns server” on cisco.com</a>. Results: a number of useless hits and IPv6 command reference. It looks like nobody took the time to write a configuration guide explaining the new feature.</p>
