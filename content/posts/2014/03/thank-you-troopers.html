<p>I spent the whole last week immersed into security-spiced atmosphere of <a href="https://www.troopers.de">Troopers</a>, a fantastic boutique security conference (like <a href="/2013/05/troopers-13-must-visit-security/">last year</a>, they limited the number of attendees and sold out weeks before the conference). </p>
<p>I admit they totally spoiled me last year, but they managed to make the conference and all the accompanying events even better.<!--more--></p>
<p>Like always, the talks were fantastic and thought provoking, from IPv6 rants to reverse engineering feats, hypervisor attacks and cloud security – someone actually managed to certify their public cloud for pharmaceutical workloads (I think it’s hard to beat that) – but the best part of the event remains the discussions and the Friday roundtable.</p>
<p class="note">I had fantastic luck during the Troopers dinner: I managed to sit down with two old-timers who still remembered the intricacies of 6502 and Z80 instruction sets.</p>
<p>So, if you live anywhere close to Europe, and have anything to do with security (or related topics), you (RFC 2119) MUST consider attending Troopers the next year … and <a href="https://twitter.com/Enno_Insinuator/status/447295788499349504">I hope to be there</a> to meet you ;)</p>
