title: Per-packet Load Balancing Interferes with TCP Offload

<p>A reader left the following comment on my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/03/ios-uses-multipath-tcp-does-it-matter.html"><em>Does Multipath TCP Matter</em></a> blog post: “<em>Why would I use MP-TCP in a data center? Couldn’t you use packet spraying at each hop and take care of re-ordering at the destination?</em>”</p>
<p><strong>Short answer</strong>: You could, but you might not want to.<!--more--></p>
<p>Packet reordering can cause several interesting problems:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>There are (<del>badly written</del> highly optimized) applications running over UDP that cannot tolerate packet reordering because they don’t buffer packets (example: VoIP);</li>
<li>Out-of-order packets reduce TCP performance.</li>
<li>Out-of-order packets kill receive side coalescing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Impact on TCP performance</h4><p>According to <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/lguohan/reorder-icoin04.pdf">this paper</a> packet reordering causes (at least) these performance problems:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>TCP receiver sends duplicate ACK packets (to trigger fast retransmit algorithm), wasting CPU cycles and bandwidth;</li>
<li>TCP sender reduces TCP window size after receiving duplicate ACKs (assuming packets were lost in transit), effectively reducing TCP throughput.</li>
<li>TCP receiver has to buffer and reorder TCP packets within the TCP stack, wasting buffer memory and CPU cycles.</li>
</ul>
<p>More information on this topic would definitely be most welcome. Please share in the comments section. Thank you!</p>
<h4>Impact on TCP offload</h4><p>On top of the performance problems listed above, packet reordering interferes with TCP offload (in particular with the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh997024.aspx">receive segment coalescing</a> functionality). </p>
<p>Receive segment coalescing is not relevant to traditional data center workloads (with most of the traffic being <em>sent</em> from servers toward remote clients), but can significantly improve the performance of elephant flows sent <em>toward </em>the server (example: <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/03/does-dedicated-iscsi-infrastructure.html">iSCS</a>I or NFS traffic). I don’t think you want to play with that, do you?</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>There are several really good reasons almost nobody does per-packet ECMP load sharing by default (Brocade being a notable exception <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/04/brocade-vcs-fabric-has-almost-perfect.html">solving the packet reordering challenges in their switch hardware</a>). </p>
