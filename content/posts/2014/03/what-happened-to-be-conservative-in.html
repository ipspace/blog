title: What Happened to “Be Conservative in What You Do”?

<p><a href="/2014/01/vsphere-does-not-need-lag-bandaids/#c8550192354905795378">A comment by Pieter E. Smit</a> on my <a href="/2014/01/vsphere-does-not-need-lag-bandaids/#comments">vSphere Does Not Need LAG Bandaids</a> post opened yet another can of worms: vSphere behavior on uplink recovery. </p>
<p><strong>Short summary</strong>: vSphere starts using an uplink as soon as its physical layer becomes operational, which might happen during ToR switch startup phase, or before a ToR switch port enters <em>forwarding </em>state.<!--more--></p>
<p>Many devices verify higher-layer availability before they start to use a point-to-point physical network link. These mechanisms could operate at layer-2 (example: LACP or UDLD) or above it – from DHCP-based address allocation to blocking - listening - learning - forwarding state transition of STP and explicit adjacencies formed by most modern routing protocols. Using a link just because your hardware detects a carrier signal is often too risky, particularly for a device that claims to be a switch with tens of servers behind it.</p>
<p>Obviously different rules apply to x86-based networking (or at least some <a href="/2011/12/vmware-vswitch-baseline-of-simplicity/">simplistic variants of it</a>) – you’re free to use a link for user traffic as soon as you can start sending packets, and when users start complaining, they <a href="http://frankdenneman.nl/2010/10/22/vswitch-failover-and-high-availability/">get a recommendation to use manual failback</a> and <a href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=1003804">change switch configuration</a>. One must wonder when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle"><em>be conservative in what you do</em></a><em> </em>principle got lost. </p>
<p class="note">I’m picking on VMware, but I’m positive other operating systems aren’t much better. If they are, please write a comment.</p>
<p>VMware finally implemented a reasonable mechanism in ESXi 5.0 – a configurable link-up delay. Too bad its default value is too low, it’s hidden somewhere in the Advanced Settings tab, and the only documentation is an arcane <a href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=2014075">knowledge base article</a>. Having an active CFM probe between uplinks belonging to the same port groups (not <a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2008/12/using-beaconing-to-detect-link-failures-or-beaconing-demystified.html">constant beaconing</a>, just a link-ready-for-forwarding test) would be even better, but it’s probably too much to hope for … or not?</p>
