<p>A while ago Sander Steffann and Iljitsch van Beijnum wrote a fantastic document that compared most (somewhat) widely used IPv6-over-IPv4 tunneling mechanisms. The document got published as <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7059">RFC 7059</a> in November and is a definite must-read for anyone having to deal with this particular can of worms.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the document doesn’t cover the recent IPv4 sunset developments – numerous mechanisms that transport IPv4 leftovers over IPv6-only access networks (MAP-E, DS-Lite, lw4over6, 464XLAT …). One can only hope Sander and Iljitsch plan to produce a complementary document soon ;)</p>
