<p>The first question I tried to answer (and probably failed to) in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN,_NFV_and_OpenFlow_for_Skeptics">SDN 101 webinar</a> was: <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/01/what-exactly-is-sdn-and-does-it-make.html">What exactly is SDN</a>? Is it an architecture with <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/04/what-is-openflow.html">physically separate centralized control plane</a>, or is it more? Does separate control plane make sense, or is it <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/the-many-paths-to-sdn.html">better to program distributed devices</a>? <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/2%20-%20SDN%20Explained.mp4">Watch the video</a> recorded during the live webinar session and tell me whether you agree with my answers.</p>
