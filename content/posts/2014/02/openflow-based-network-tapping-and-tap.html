title: OpenFlow-Based Network Tapping and Tap Aggregation Networks

<p>Network tapping and tap aggregation are obviously the OpenFlow equivalent of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program"><em>Hello World</em></a><em> </em>application – almost every OpenFlow controller vendor has a tap aggregation solution. Does that make sense? Sure – tap aggregation network is outside of the production data path and thus a great candidate for semi-production technology pilots.</p>
<p>For more details, watch the <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/4%20-%20Tap%20Aggregation%20Networks.mp4"><em>Tap Aggregation Networks</em></a> video recorded during the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Real_Life_OpenFlow-based_SDN_Use_Cases"><em>Real Life OpenFlow-based SDN Use Cases</em></a> webinar</p>
