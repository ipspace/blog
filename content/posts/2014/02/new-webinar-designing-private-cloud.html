<p>It’s always fun watching people replacing an older IBM mainframe with a new model – they usually replace a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360">hall-full of gear</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System_z">a fridge-like box</a>. Something similar is happening in the private cloud world – you can build most private clouds with a handful of high-end servers and two top-of-rack switches.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss the implications of incredible advances in server and switching technologies in the new <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Designing_a_Private_Cloud"><em>Designing a Private Cloud</em></a><em> </em>webinar (<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/designing-a-private-cloud-tickets-10114547885?ref=blog">register here</a>). The initial materials have already been uploaded – browse through them after registering and send me any additional topics you’d like to see discussed.</p>
