title: 'Micro-BFD: BFD over LAG (Port Channel)'

<p>The discussion in the comments to my <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/10/lag-versus-ecmp.html"><em>LAG versus EC</em><em>M</em><em>P</em></a> post took a totally unexpected turn when someone mentioned BFD failure detection over port channels (link aggregation groups – LAGs).</p>
<p>What’s the big deal?<!--more--></p>
<h4>What is BFD</h4><p>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is a lightweight protocol that “<em>provides low-overhead, short-duration detection of failures in the path between adjacent forwarding engines</em>” (straight from <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5880">RFC 5880</a>).</p>
<p>Networking engineers love BFD for several reasons:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>It’s simpler and less CPU-intensive than routing protocol adjacency messages;</li>
<li>It can be implemented in smart linecards, further reducing the control-plane CPU load, and making it possible to detect forwarding failures in milliseconds even on boxes with hundreds of interfaces (try doing that with OSPF);</li>
<li>It detects <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance">byzantine failures</a> between two forwarding engines that cannot be reliably detected at physical and data-link layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>BFD uses the principle of <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/08/fate-sharing-in-ip-networks.html"><em>shared fate</em></a><em> </em>to do its job – it tests the actual transmission path using the same protocol (IP) as the forwarded traffic – and thus reliably detects a forwarding failure in a simple transmission path, regardless of the number of components in the path.</p>

<h4>BFD and LAG</h4><p>LAG appears as a single layer-2 forwarding path to layer-3 forwarding engine. BFD messages can take any one of the links in the LAG (based on the LAG load balancing algorithm), breaking the <em>shared fate </em>assumption – a forwarded packet traversing another LAG member link might encounter a partially failed component, and it’s impossible for BFD to detect that.</p>

<p>The only solution to this problem is to run BFD across <em>every </em>LAG member link – the BFD code has to become LAG-aware and test end-to-end connectivity across every member link independently (see <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7130">RFC 7130</a> for more details). Even more, LACP and BFD have to work in parallel – a member is added to a LAG only when both LACP and BFD agree it’s OK to do so.</p>
