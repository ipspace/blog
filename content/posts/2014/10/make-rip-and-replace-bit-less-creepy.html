<p>It was a dark and stormy Halloween night and a networking engineer was stuck in a data center facing a Mission Impossible project: replace a failing Cat6500 with a brand-new Nexus 7000. Shouldn’t have been a problem, if only the cables were labeled.<!--more--></p>
<p>Ever faced a project like that? I was fortunate – I never did, but I can easily imagine the nightmare of disconnecting hundreds of cables (even when they’re properly labeled) and reconnecting them to a new box (and they don’t run LLDP on the attached servers for a good reason, right?)</p>
<p>A while ago I got an email from Mark Costigan, a UK inventor who claimed to have a solution for that problem: the <a href="http://www.sergeantclip.com/">Sergeant Clip</a>. It seemed too good to be true, so I asked by NFD friends about their opinions, and it turns out Matthew Norwood <a href="http://www.insearchoftech.com/2014/02/10/easier-cabling-migrations/">already used the clip and loved the results</a>. Did you use the clip? Do you think it might be useful? Share your opinion in the comments!</p>
