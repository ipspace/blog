<p>Last week’s Interop New York was hard work (three workshops in two days), but also lots of nerdy fun. I love doing workshops with smart participants who bring their real-life problems to the room and challenge my assumptions and conclusions, and I had plenty of these interactions during the week. Thank you all (you know who you are)!<!--more--></p>
<p>The other great part of Interop is meeting my <a href="http://techfieldday.com/nfd/">Networking Tech Field Day</a> friends. These chats usually turn into amazing conversations that help me fit together bits and pieces I’ve been struggling with for weeks or months, often resulting in (hopefully) interesting blog posts</p>
<p>Finally, a huge <strong>Thank You</strong> to the Interop team for a fantastically well-organized conference, and I hope to see you all in Las Vegas in a few months. </p>
