<p>My “<a href="/2014/10/bufferbloat-killed-my-http-session-or.html"><em>W</em><em>as it bufferbloat</em></a><em>?</em>” blog post generated an unexpected amount of responses, most of them focusing on a side note saying “<em>it looks like there really are service providers out there that are clueless enough to reorder packets within a TCP session</em>”. Let’s walk through them.<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite">Why do you say that out of order packets are SP's issue? SP only provides IP connectivity and does not care about top sessions?</blockquote>
<p>The out-of-order packets are definitely not SP’s issue. After all, they don’t care if I get reduced TCP throughput (see “<a href="/2014/03/per-packet-load-balancing-interferes.html"><em>Per-Packet Load Balancing Interferes with TCP Offload</em></a>” and related comments for more details). They are, however, usually the ones causing the reordering.</p>
<p class="note">Packet reordering is obviously a bad thing within a data center, but it's unclear how much (if any) damage is done by packet reordering on low-speed long-delay links. Links to reasonably authoritative material are highly appreciated.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I also thought that TCP segment reordering is a job of the Transport layer, which is a layer on the client and server, and what in the middle are not aware of.</blockquote>
<p>TCP segment <em>reassembly </em>into a <a href="/2014/09/tcp-is-stream-protocol.html">seamless stream</a> is the job of the transport layer, but do keep in mind that the transport layer (TCP code in receiving host, to be more precise) can do its job better and faster if the packets are not reordered. As soon as the packets start arriving out of sequence, the TCP receiver doesn’t know whether they were reordered or lost in transit, and has to start considering recovery actions.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Different packets in the same session are not guaranteed to take the same path through the Internet.</blockquote>
<p>Agreed, but that’s not nice and is best avoided if at all possible.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">And if Apache sent all the data, the client should get all the data, before they process the closing of the TCP stream.</blockquote>
<p>Precisely at this point the Reality decided to raise its unpredictable head and disagree.</p>
<h4>Why Are TCP Packets Reordered?</h4><p>One of the readers wrote: </p>
<blockquote class="cite">Due to various path and link load-balancing methods, different packets can take a different path, and some might be queued differently along the path, or the path might have a different latency -- resulting in unpredictable ordering.</blockquote>
<p>While he’s correct, his argument is slightly academic. Most networking equipment implements 5-tuple load balancing (or <a href="/2006/12/per-port-cef-load-sharing.html">per-port load balancing</a>) for a reason: it’s not safe to send the packets of the same session over multiple paths (particularly if they are UDP packets). <a href="/2011/04/brocade-vcs-fabric-has-almost-perfect.html">Brocade is the only vendor that can do per-packet load balancing without reordering packets</a>, and even they’re limited to parallel links that have to be terminated on the same ASIC on two adjacent boxes.</p>
<p>Using per-packet load balancing (where you’d send packets of the same session over multiple paths with different latencies) is rarely implemented in practice – it would generate too many unnecessary support calls.</p>
<p>Some people quote routing protocol convergence as the cause of reordered packets. Yet again, they are correct from the academic perspective, but I don’t expect a service provider to change network topology (which would result in potential reordering) every few seconds.</p>
<p>The same reader did identify the probably cause for most packet reordering we see: packets from the same stream are <em>queued differently</em>, either due to <a href="#TCP_Reordering">different forwarding paths they take within a device</a> or due to landing in different queues.</p>
<p><strong>Why would two packets from the same session land in different queues?</strong> The only reason I can see is rate limiting with out-of-contract packet remarking (set different DSCP value on out-of-contract packets) followed by a queuing configuration that puts out-of-contract packets in a different queue.</p>
<p><strong>How can I fix that?</strong> Don’t use different queues; use WRED with different weights ensuring the out-of-contract packets get dropped way before you start dropping in-contract packets.</p>
