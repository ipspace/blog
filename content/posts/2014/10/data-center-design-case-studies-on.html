title: Data Center Design Case Studies on Amazon – Take 2
url: /2014/10/data-center-design-case-studies-on.html
---

<p>In July I wrote about an <a href="/2014/07/data-center-design-case-studies-on.html">Amazon Kindle version of my Data Center Design Case Studies book</a> and complained about their royalties model. Someone quickly pointed out how to adapt to their system: split the book into multiple volumes and charge $9.99 for each.</p>
<p>It took me months to get there, but the first two volumes are finally on Amazon:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/WAN-Edge-Data-Center-Designs-ebook/dp/B00NXPDTVQ/ref=sr_1_8">Volume I</a> covers WAN edge connectivity, including data center interconnects, BGP and DMVPN scalability;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Data-Center-Infrastructure-Designs-Connectivity-ebook/dp/B00NXQQYS0/">Volume II</a> covers cloud infrastructure, including server connectivity, scale-out network security solutions, and scale-out cloud infrastructure architectures;</li>
<li>Volume III (once it’s complete) will cover virtual appliances, active/active data centers and a few other interesting topics.</li>
</ul>
<div class="more">The book is also available on other Amazon Kindle stores - you'll easily find it by name.</div>
<p>The three volumes will have the exactly same content as the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Design_Case_Studies">PDF version of the book</a> you can <a href="https://cms.ipspace.net/bin/buy?id=DCDesign">buy on my web site</a>. The complete book will no longer be available on Amazon; if you bought it (thank you!) you’ll continue getting updates as I write new chapters.</p>
