<p>A third of my readers are celebrating Thanksgiving today, and I’d like to use the opportunity to say what I always wanted to say but somehow never got to it. Let’s make it short: Thank you! Without you, there would be no ipSpace.net.<!--more--></p>
<p>A huge THANK YOU goes to you, my dear subscribers. Your trust in my content allows me to focus on what I always wanted to do: explain how new technologies and architectures work, without being burdened by the need to sell individual articles or classroom seats.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank everyone who ever asked a question, wrote a comment, or sent me links to additional information (or an occasional thank-you note ;). Your prodding keeps me pushing forward, and it’s really comforting to know that every time I try to venture into something I’m not absolutely familiar with, someone will immediately set me straight and keep me closer to reality.</p>
<p>Thanks again, and I hope you’ll have a wonderful and quiet Thanksgiving (assuming you celebrate it) or a nice weekend with your loved ones (if you’re in the rest of the world).</p>
