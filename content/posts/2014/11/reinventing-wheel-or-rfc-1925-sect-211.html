<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/104205134740204626607/posts">Simon Wardley</a> is another old-timer with low tolerance for people reinventing the broken wheels. I couldn’t resist sharing part of <a href="http://blog.gardeviance.org/2014/11/bimodal-it-is-long-hand-for-snafu.html">his blog post</a> because it applies equally well to what we’re seeing in the SDN world:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">No, I haven't read Gartner's recent research on this subject (I'm not a subscriber) and it seems weird to be reading "research" about stuff you've done in practice a decade ago (<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/11/we-had-sdn-in-1993-and-didnt-know-it.html">sounds familiar</a>). Maybe they've found some magic juice? Experience however dictates that it'll be snake oil […]. I feel like the old car mechanic listening to the kid saying that his magic pill turns water into gas. I'm sure it doesn't ... maybe this time it will ... duh, suckered again.</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile the <a href="https://www.sdncentral.com/news/scott-shenker-preaches-revised-sdn-sdnv2/2014/10/">academics already talk about SDN 2.0</a>.</p>
