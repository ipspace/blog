<p>It was a dark stormy autumn night and three networking engineers had nothing better to do than ponder the heavy topics of transactional consistency in a distributed SDN environment in <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_16-Transactional_Thoughts_on_a_Stormy_Night.mp3">Episode 16</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild</a> podcast.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the topics that crossed our minds:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>What happens when an SDN-driven network update fails?</li>
<li>Will SDN save us from manual errors? Will it make us more precise?</li>
<li>How will we cope with API/CLI changes between software releases?</li>
<li>Automating everything might result in making a big mess out of everything.</li>
<li>We should design for failures, not try to do everything to avoid them, and continuously test our network under failure scenarios</li>
<li>Should we leave the underlay alone and never touch it (like we never touched the optical transport two decades ago)?</li>
<li>We have to change our way of thinking and get used (again) to the benefits of decoupling;</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, there were two evergreen topics we couldn’t possibly avoid:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Per-application appliances as compared to big bad boxes;</li>
<li>Lack of ASICs in network appliances.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here’s the list of things we mentioned (and promised to get them into show notes):</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>NTT Global IP Network Configuration Tool (NANOG 54): <a href="http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog54/presentations/Tuesday/Morris.pdf">http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog54/presentations/Tuesday/Morris.pdf</a></li>
