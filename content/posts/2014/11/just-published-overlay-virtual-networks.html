<p><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/tag/overlay-networks.html">Overlay virtual networks</a> are one of my favorite topics – it seems I wrote over a hundred blog posts describing various aspects of this emerging (or is it reinvented) technology since Cisco launched VXLAN in 2011.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2014 I organized my blog posts on overlay networks and SDDC into a <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Overlay_Virtual_Networks_in_Software-Defined_Data_Centers">digital book</a>. I want to make this information as useful and as widely distributed as possible – for a limited time you can <a href="http://cms.ipspace.net/bin/enroll?id=xSDNOverlay">download the PDF free of charge</a>.</p>
