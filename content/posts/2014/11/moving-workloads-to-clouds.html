<p>David Spark published <a href="http://www.enterprisecioforum.com/en/blogs/david-spark/16-tips-moving-your-workloads-cloud">16 tips for moving your workloads to the clouds</a>. Contrary to the usual useless nonsense coming down from hybrid cloud evangelists (you know, the people who moved from “<a href="http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/news/1280099182/Myth-of-VM-mobility-and-follow-the-sun-data-centers">VMs following the sun</a>” to “seamless hybrid cloud workload mobility”) some of the tips actually make sense, starting with “Have a real reason for the migration”. Enjoy!</p>
