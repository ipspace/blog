title: Connecting Legacy Servers to Overlay Virtual Networks

<p>I <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/10/vxlan-termination-on-physical-devices.html">wrote</a> (and spoke) at length about <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/VXLAN/6.2%20-%20VXLAN%20Gateway%20Deployment%20Options.mp4">layer-2 and layer-3</a> gateways between VLANs and overlay virtual networks, but I still get <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/05/it-doesnt-make-sense-to-virtualize-80.html?showComment=1399568679502#c6644146531384135125">questions</a> along the lines of “<em>how will you connect legacy servers to the new cloud infrastructure that uses VXLAN?</em>”<!--more--></p>
<h4>Gateway Types</h4><p>You can connect an overlay virtual network and a physical subnet with:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>A network services device (firewall, load balancer …);</li>
<li>Layer-3 gateway (router);</li>
<li>Layer-2 gateway (bridge).</li>
</ul>
<p>A network services device is the best choice if you have to connect a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/06/dynamic-routing-with-virtual-appliances.html">wholly virtualized application stack to the outside world</a>, or if you’re connecting components that have to be isolated by a firewall or load balancer anyway. </p>
<p>Layer-3 gateway is the best option when you’re connecting physical and virtual subnets and don’t have to retain IP addresses of newly virtualized physical servers. Layer-2 gateway is the last-resort option used when you have to stretch the same IP subnet across physical and virtual domains.</p>
<h4>Physical or virtual gateways?</h4><p>It doesn’t make sense to waste our gray matter on this question in low-bandwidth environments (up to 1Gbps of traffic between the legacy servers and the overlay virtual networks). <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/virtual-appliance-performance-is.html">VM-based virtual gateways are good enough</a> and extremely easy to deploy. You’re also avoiding any hardware lock-in – it’s pretty simple to replace the gateway solution if you don’t like it.</p>
<p class="note">Some overlay virtual networking solutions (example: <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/07/unicast-only-vxlan-finally-shipping.html">unicast VXLAN on Cisco Nexus 1000V</a> don’t work with any existing hardware gateway anyway).</p>
<p>x86-based gateways can provide at least 10Gbps of throughput. If you need more than that <em>across a single VLAN or tenant </em>you should be looking at dedicated hardware. If you need more than 10Gbps aggregate throughput, but not more than a Gbps or two per tenant, you might be better served with a scale-out farm of x86-based gateways – after all, you might be able to reuse them if your needs change (and there’s no hardware lock-in).</p>
<h4>How many gateways should one have?</h4><p><strong>Short answer</strong>: as few as possible. </p>
<p>Every gateway has to be managed and configured. Numerous gateways between physical and virtual worlds are a potential source of forwarding or routing loops, and some vendors limit the number of gateways you can have anyway.</p>
<p>In the ideal world, you’d have just two gateways (for redundancy purposes) connecting the legacy servers to the cloud infrastructure using overlay virtual networking; you might need more than that in high-bandwidth environments if you decide to use VM-based or x86-based gateways (see above). </p>
<p>The gateways would run in either active/backup configuration (example: Cisco VXLAN gateway, VM-based or x86-based VMware NSX gateways) or in MLAG-type deployment where two physical switches present themselves as a single VTEP (IP address) to the overlay virtual networking fabric (example: <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/09/arista-launches-first-hardware-vxlan.html">Arista VXLAN gateways</a>, <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/04/brocade-shipped-vxlan-vtep-with-nsx.html">NSX VTEP on Brocade Logical Chassis</a>, Cisco Nexus 9300).</p>
