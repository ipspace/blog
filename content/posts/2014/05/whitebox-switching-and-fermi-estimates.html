<p>Craig Matsumoto <a href="http://www.sdncentral.com/news/5-reasons-ethernet-switch-vendors-worry/2014/05/">recently quoted some astonishing claims</a> from Dell’Oro Group analyst Alan Weckel:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Whitebox switches (combined) will be the second largest ToR vendor;</li>
<li>Whitebox 10GE ports will cost around $100.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s try to <a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/84/">guestimate</a> how realistic these claims are.<!--more--></p>
<p>According to the same source, “<em>whitebox switching comes down to just two customers: Amazon and Google</em>”. Each of them has <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/161772-microsoft-now-has-one-million-servers-less-than-google-but-more-than-amazon-says-ballmer">approximately a million servers</a>. Assuming <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1873741-amazon-web-services-growth-valuations-and-competition">50% year-over-year growth rate</a> (which has never been sustained for long periods), both companies have to buy around a million new servers (and switch ports) every year. </p>
<p>The total value of those switch ports (according to Craig’s source) would be $100M. Let’s round this up (you need uplinks, spine switches …) to $200M.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.networkcomputing.com/networking/data-center-networking-market-to-reach-$2185-billion-by-2018-report/d/d-id/1234507?">current size of data center networking market</a> is $12B, and <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-center-ethernet-switch-market-hits-8-billion-run-rate-according-to-crehan-research-196847151.html">Ethernet switches represent at least $8B out of that total</a>, with fixed switches being two thirds of that (around 5B). The $200M guestimate from the previous paragraph would represent 4% of the market share. I hope the second ToR vendor has more than that, or we’re really dealing with Cisco and seven dwarflings.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: the whitebox switching claims were exaggerated unless the analysts considered 10GE-only ToR switches, in which case they might be about right (but that’s not what <a href="http://www.sdncentral.com/news/5-reasons-ethernet-switch-vendors-worry/2014/05/">the article</a> said).</p>
