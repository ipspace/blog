<p>Everyone (and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/05/23/google_containerization_two_billion/">The Register</a>) talks about Linux containers these days like they would be the hottest thing invented this spring. In reality, it’s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups">seven year old technology</a> that was heavily used by some smart web hosting companies for years (but of course some people think mentioning Google makes everything look sexier).</p>
<p>If you’re interested in a <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/X1%20-%20Virtual%20Machines%20Linux%20Containers.mp4">high-level overview of differences between Linux containers and more traditional virtual machines</a>, watch the video from the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Virtualized_Networking"><em>Introduction to Virtual Networking</em></a> webinar.</p>
