  SDN is no exception. The reality might be a bit different.

A while ago [Paul Stewart wrote a fantastic blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20140704214845/http://www.packetu.com/2014/05/02/one-cares-sdn/) listing the potential business benefits of SDN (as promoted by SDN evangelists and SDN-washing vendors).

Here's his list:
<!--more-->
> -   Abstracted Control Plane for a Central Point of Management
> -   Granular Control of Flows (as required/desired)
> -   Network Function Virtualization and Service Chaining
> -   Decreased dependence on devices like load balancers
> -   Facilitation of system orchestration
> -   Easier troubleshooting/visibility
> -   Platform for chargeback/showback
> -   Decreased complexity and cost
> -   Increased ability to utilize hardware and interconnections
> -   DevOps friendly architecture

I have just one problem with this list -- I've seen a similar list of benefits of IPv6:

Unfortunately, the reality of IT in general and IPv6 in particular is a bit different. The overly hyped IPv6 benefits remain [myths and legends](https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/03/more-details-seven-ipv6-myths.html); all we got were longer addresses, incompatible protocols (OSPFv3 anyone), and half-thought-out implementations (example: [DNS autoconfiguration](http://blog.ipspace.net/2010/03/more-details-seven-ipv6-myths.html)) ridden with [religious wars](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/10/ipv6-multiple-addresses-per-interface.html) (try to ask "*[why don't we have first-hop router in DHCPv6](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/10/dhcpv6-matters.html)*" on any IPv6 mailing list ;).

You might also want to watch the [fantastically cynical presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVpYjk90hcI&feature=youtu.be) Enno Rey had @ [Troopers 2014 IPv6 Security summit](https://www.troopers.de/troopers14/troopers14-ipv6-security-summit-2014/troopers14-ipv6-security-summit-2014-presentations/index.html).
