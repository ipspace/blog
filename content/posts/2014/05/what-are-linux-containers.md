Everyone talks about Linux containers these days like they would be the hottest thing invented this spring. In reality, it's a [pretty old technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups) that was heavily used by some smart web hosting companies for years (but of course, some people think mentioning Google makes everything look sexier).

If you're interested in a [high-level overview of differences between Linux containers and more traditional virtual machines](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/VMintro/2.1%20-%20Server%20and%20Container%20Virtualization.mp4?doccode=VMintro), watch the video from the [*Introduction to Virtual Networking*](http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Virtualized_Networking) webinar.
