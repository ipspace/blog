<p>Idiots posting random comments with (not-so-very) hidden links to whatever warez they're selling are utterly annoying, but there's always one-in-a-million chance for a hilarious one. This is what I got on the <a href="/2011/02/traffic-trombone-what-it-is-and-how-you/">Traffic Trombone</a> post:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">The traffic across the network core and the end-to-end latency would be minimal (the same packet would traverse the core only once), increasing visits to my adult site.</blockquote>
