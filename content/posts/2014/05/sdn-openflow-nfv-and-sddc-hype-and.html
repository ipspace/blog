<p>There are tons of SDN workshops, academies, and webinars out there, many of them praising the almost-magic properties of the new technologies, or the shininess of vendors’ new gadgets and strategic alliances. Not surprisingly, the dirty details of real-life deployments aren’t their main focus.</p>
<p>As you might expect, my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN,_OpenFlow,_NFV_and_SDDC">2-day workshop</a> isn’t one of them.<!--more--></p>
<p>The workshop covers the major aspects of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN,_OpenFlow,_NFV_and_SDDC#Day_1">SDN, OpenFlow, NFV</a>, <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN,_OpenFlow,_NFV_and_SDDC#Day_2">SDDC, and overlay virtual networks</a>, describes numerous real-life use cases (some almost a decade old), explains the benefits of SDN and SDDC, but also documents a few harsh truths including:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Centralized control plane is an old concepts with well-known limitations;</li>
<li>Numerous architectures with centralized control have failed in the past;</li>
<li>OpenFlow-only solutions have significant scalability challenges;</li>
<li>The state of OpenFlow support in data center switches from major vendors is depressing;</li>
<li>Orchestration is the hardest part of any NFV solution; </li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re considering an SDN pilot, or want to include SDN or NFV into your short-term network plans, you just might benefit from a realistic view of these exciting (but unfortunately overhyped) technologies.</p>
<h4>How can I register?</h4><p><strong>Open enrollment</strong>: Some high-quality training companies will offer the workshop as part of their regular training schedule.

<p><strong>Online</strong>: Most of the material is already available in form of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Roadmap/SDN_and_OpenFlow_webinars">various SDN webinars</a>. The webinars and the workshop materials will be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">eventually consistent</a>, but it will take a while.</p>
