<p>I don’t think it would be too hard to guess the topic of my talk at the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/03/thank-you-troopers.html">recent Troopers conference</a>: SDN was the obvious choice, and the presentation simply had to include security aspects of SDN.</p>
<p><strong>TL&amp;DR summary:</strong> We know how to do it. We also know it's not simple.<!--more--></p>
<p>Good news: securing an SDN solution is no different from securing any other controller-based platform (ranging from Frame Relay to wireless controllers), so we’re well aware what the potential attack surfaces are and how to protect them (and so are the bad guys, which the <em>bad news</em> part of the story).</p>
<p>No too many people are familiar with the non-hyped reality of SDN, so I had to include “what is SDN” and “what is OpenFlow” sections; you’d be better off watching <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/SDN101#Videos">relevant videos</a> from my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN,_NFV_and_OpenFlow_for_Skeptics">SDN, NFV and OpenFlow for Skeptics</a> webinar.</p>
<p>Finally, I included a section describing a few security-related solutions (<a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/3%20-%20Network%20Monitoring.mp4">network monitoring</a>, <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/4%20-%20Tap%20Aggregation%20Networks.mp4">tap aggregation</a> and <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/7%20-%20Distributed%20DoS%20Prevention.mp4">scale-out IDS</a>); yet again, you’ll get more information in the <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/SDNUses#Videos">videos</a> from <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Real_Life_OpenFlow-based_SDN_Use_Cases">Real Life OpenFlow-based SDN Use Cases</a> webinar.</p>
<p>Slide deck is <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/SDN%20Security%20-%20Troopers%202014.pdf">already on my web site</a>; the video will be published in a few weeks. Enjoy!</p>
