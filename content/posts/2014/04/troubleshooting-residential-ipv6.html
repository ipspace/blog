<p>Most ISPs rolling out large-scale residential IPv6 (bringing <a href="#tab=per-country-ipv6-adoption">US to ~7%</a>, Switzerland to ~10% and Belgium above 16%) agree it’s a no-brainer, but the rest of the world still hesitates. </p>
<p>To help the dubious majority cross the (perceived) shaky bridge across the gaping chasm between IPv4 and IPv6, a team of great engineers with decades of IPv6 operational experience (including networking gurus from Time Warner, Comcast and Yahoo, and the never-tiring <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/06/slovenians-presenting-leading-edge-ipv6.html">IPv6 evangelist Jan Žorž</a>) wrote an <a href="http://go6.si/ipv6-troubleshooting-for-helpdesks/"><em>IPv6 Troubleshooting for Helpdesks</em></a> document.<!--more--></p>
<p>The idea itself is great, the implementation is even better: Jason Fesler created an <a href="http://www.test-ipv6.com/">IPv6 troubleshooting web site</a> that you can point your customers to (or use a local – potentially branded – mirror). The web site checks the browser’s behavior and reports its findings with a simple error code that a totally clueless user can pass to the ISP’s helpdesk. </p>
<p>The rest of the document deals with specific actions (including Windows and OSX command line troubleshooting procedures) that have to be taken based on the initial diagnosis.</p>
<p>Have to admit this is one of the best troubleshooting approaches I’ve seen so far and a huge help in jumpstarting residential IPv6 deployments. Great job!</p>
