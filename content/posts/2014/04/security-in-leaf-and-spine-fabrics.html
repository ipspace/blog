title: Security in Leaf-and-Spine Fabrics
url: /2014/04/security-in-leaf-and-spine-fabrics.html
---

<p>One of my readers sent me an interesting question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">How does one impose a security policy on servers connected via a Clos fabric? The traditional model of segregating servers into vlans/zones and enforcing policy with a security device doesn’t fit here. Can VRF-lite be used on the mesh to accomplish segregation?</blockquote>
<p><strong>Good news:</strong> the security aspects of leaf-and-spine fabrics are no different from more traditional architectures.<!--more--></p>
<p>Leaf-and-spine (or Clos) architecture is just a pretty optimal way of connecting switches in a fabric that results in equidistant endpoints. Here are two slides from my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Clos_fabrics_explained">Clos Fabric Explained</a> webinar that illustrate the difference.</p>

<p>As long as the leaf nodes have the ability to spread the traffic across all uplinks, leaf-and-spine architecture can implement layer-2 or layer-3 networks. Layer-2 leaf-and-spine architectures may be limited to two spine nodes (in a VSS/vPC/MC-LAG cluster) unless you’re deploying one of the layer-2 ECMP technologies (Trill, FabricPath, VCS Fabric, SPB…).</p>
<p>You can also implement a mixed layer-2+layer-3 leaf-and-spine network with layer-3 forwarding implemented in the core switches (using any variant of multi-node FHRP) or <a href="/2013/05/optimal-l3-forwarding-with-varp-and.html">across all leaf switches</a>. </p>
<p class="info">I would strongly recommend using layer-3 leaf-and-spine fabric with overlay virtual networks on top of it, but that’s a different story.</p>
<p>Connecting a security device to a leaf-and-spine fabric is no different from connecting a security device to a traditional data center network – you have to pull multiple VLANs (or VRFs) to the ToR switch to which the security device is connected.</p>
<p class="info">I would virtualize the security device and connect it to overlay virtual networks, but yet again, that’s a different story.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: You don’t have to learn any new tricks to implement security in leaf-and-spine fabrics. Use whatever worked for you in the past.</p>
<h4>Need more details?</h4><p>The <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Clos_fabrics_explained">Clos Fabrics Explained</a> webinar contains a detailed explanation of numerous leaf-and-spine designs including:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Non-redundant layer-3 design;</li>
<li>Layer-3 design with multihomed servers;</li>
<li>Layer-2-only design without server-to-switch LAG (ideal for vSphere deployments);</li>
<li>Layer-2 design with server-to-switch LAG;</li>
<li>Mixed L2/L3 design with L3 forwarding on spine switches;</li>
<li>Mixed L2/L3 design with L3 forwarding on leaf switches.</li>
</ul>
