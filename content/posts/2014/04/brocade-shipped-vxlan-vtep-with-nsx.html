<p>A <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/04/vmware-nsx-documentation-and-resources.html?showComment=1397834192952#c392500779555574829">comment by Brook Reams</a> on my recent blog post was a fantastic surprise: Brocade is the first vendor that actually shipped a <a href="http://www.brocade.com/downloads/documents/html_product_manuals/NOS_411_AG/GUID-773FF857-F62D-4A4A-89AA-B2301BF3ED8E.html">VXLAN VTEP controlled by a VMware NSX controller</a>. It’s amazing to see how Brocade leapfrogged everyone else (they also added tons of other new functionality in NOS releases 4.0 and 4.1).<!--more--></p>
<p class="update">2014-04-23T06:33Z: updated the blog post to mention Arista's IP MC VTEP and Nuage VSG 7850</p>
<h4>The really interesting part</h4><p>Every other shipping hardware VXLAN gateway (Arista and F5) that integrates with vSphere environment implements multicast-based VXLAN. </p>
<p>Brocade decided to skip the multicast VXLAN support and implemented only VMware NSX gateway functionality. Obviously they don’t believe in viability of Cisco’s Nexus 1000V (or VMware’s vCNS).</p>
<h4>Anyone else?</h4><ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Arista has a shipping L2 VTEP that uses IP multicast. They might have OVSDB agent (which is needed to work with the NSX controller), but it’s not yet documented in public EOS documentation.</li>
<li>Nuage VSG 7850 is also shipping, but does not work with either multicast-based VXLAN or NSX controller. It uses MP-BGP to integrate with other controllers within the Nuage's Virtual Services Platform (VSP).</li>
<li>Cisco is going its own way with ACI.</li>
<li>Dell seems stuck – the Z9000 documentation published on their web is almost a year old, everything else is older.</li>
<li>HP claims <a href="http://h17007.www1.hp.com/docs/hvn/FlexFabric5930Switch_FactSheet.pdf">hardware VXLAN support on FlexFabric 5930AF</a> switches (which probably means “we’re using Trident-2 chipset”); haven’t found anything VXLAN-related in their manuals.</li>
<li>Juniper is promising VXLAN on QFX5100 and MX-series routers; it looks like they haven’t shipped yet.</li>
</ul>
<h4>More information</h4><p>The <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/data-center-fabrics-update-tickets-8753807875?aff=blog">Data Center Fabrics update session</a> in May 2014 will cover new data center switches and software functionality introduced by Arista, Brocade, Cisco, Juniper, and maybe one or two other vendors in the last 12 months.</p>
<p class="info">Do I have to mention that you get immediate access to all existing materials and videos of the Data Center Fabrics webinar when you register for the update session?</p>
