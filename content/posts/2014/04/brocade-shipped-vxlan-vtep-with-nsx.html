title: Brocade Shipped VXLAN VTEP with NSX Controller Support

<div class='update'>Update 2021-01-03: NSX-V is enjoying its retirement, making any related VXLAN hardware gateways obsolete. In the meantime, VMware NSBU came to their senses and implemented EVPN in NSX-T 3.0, VCS Fabric is long gone, and Ethernet part of Brocade was acquired by Extreme.</div>
<p>Brook Reams sent me an interesting tidbit: Brocade is the first vendor that actually shipped a <a href="http://www.brocade.com/downloads/documents/html_product_manuals/NOS_411_AG/GUID-773FF857-F62D-4A4A-89AA-B2301BF3ED8E.html">VXLAN VTEP controlled by a VMware NSX controller</a>. It’s amazing to see how Brocade leapfrogged everyone else (they also added tons of other new functionality in NOS releases 4.0 and 4.1).<!--more--></p>
<h4>The really interesting part</h4><p>Every other shipping hardware VXLAN gateway (Arista and F5) that integrates with vSphere environment implements multicast-based VXLAN. </p>
<p>Brocade decided to skip the multicast VXLAN support and implemented only VMware NSX gateway functionality. Obviously they don’t believe in viability of Cisco’s Nexus 1000V (or VMware’s vCNS).</p>
<h4>Anyone else?</h4><ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Arista has a shipping L2 VTEP that uses IP multicast. They might have OVSDB agent (which is needed to work with the NSX controller), but it’s not yet documented in public EOS documentation.</li>
<li>Nuage VSG 7850 is also shipping, but does not work with either multicast-based VXLAN or NSX controller. It uses MP-BGP to integrate with other controllers within the Nuage's Virtual Services Platform (VSP).</li>
<li>Cisco is going its own way with ACI.</li>
<li>Dell seems stuck – the Z9000 documentation published on their web is almost a year old, everything else is older.</li>
<li>HP claims <a href="http://h17007.www1.hp.com/docs/hvn/FlexFabric5930Switch_FactSheet.pdf">hardware VXLAN support on FlexFabric 5930AF</a> switches (which probably means “we’re using Trident-2 chipset”); haven’t found anything VXLAN-related in their manuals.</li>
<li>Juniper is promising VXLAN on QFX5100 and MX-series routers; it looks like they haven’t shipped yet.</li>
</ul>
