title: Network Function Virtualization (NFV) 101

---

<p>When I first heard about NFV, I thought it was just another <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/03/open-networking-foundation-fabric.html">steaming pile of hype</a> designed to push the appliance vendors to offer their solutions in VM format. After all, we’re past the hard technical challenges: <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/05/dedicated-hardware-in-network-services.html">most appliances deserve to have an Intel Inside sticker</a>, <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/virtual-appliance-performance-is.html">performance problems have been addressed</a> (see <a href="https://01.org/sites/default/files/downloads/intel_dpdk_vswitch_040_gsg.pdf">Intel DPDK</a>, <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/02/6wind-solving-virtual-appliance.html">6WIND</a>, <a href="http://www.ntop.org/products/pf_ring/">PF_ring</a> and <a href="http://www.snabb.co/">Snabb Switch</a>), so what’s stopping us from deploying NFV apart from stubborn vendors who want to sell hardware, not licenses?<!--more--></p>
<p>As I explained in the <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/5%20-%20Network%20Function%20Virtualization.mp4">Network Function Virtualization</a> part of my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN,_NFV_and_OpenFlow_for_Skeptics">SDN, OpenFlow and NFV for the Skeptic</a>s webinar, things are never as simple as they look:</p>
<ul><li>It’s pretty easy to offer existing appliances in VM format. Most load balancer and firewall vendors got the message, and some of the software-only solutions have <a href="http://www.f5.com/pdf/products/big-ip-virtual-editions-datasheet.pdf">impressive performance</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Designing_Private_Cloud_Infrastructure">Building a cloud environment</a> that will allow you to deploy these appliances on demand is a no-brainer. If you’re new to this game, buy a solution from VMware or Microsoft, if you have more experience, build your own open-source solution with OpenStack or CloudStack (like most service providers are doing).</li>
<li>The real problem is the orchestration: mapping new service request into VMs that have to be spun up, provisioning and configuration of those VMs, and service integration (<a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/5%20-%20Service%20Insertion.mp4">inserting service VMs into the forwarding path</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, you could hack together your own solution to solve these challenges or engage a vendor offering an extensible service provisioning framework. If you read <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/05/tail-f-network-control-system-first.html">my posts</a> on <a href="http://www.tail-f.com/networking-field-day-7-san-jose-ca/">Tail-f’s NCS</a>, you probably already know what <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/11/terastream-part-2-lightweight-4over6.html">many NFV pilots</a> use as their orchestration solution.</p>
