<p>As expected, ARIN wasn’t that far behind APNIC and RIPE in IPv4 allocations and is <a href="https://www.arin.net/resources/request/ipv4_countdown.html">now down to the last /8</a>. Maybe it’s time for the last denialists to wake up and start considering IPv6 (or not – consultants love panicking customers)… and the new <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6">IPv6 resources</a> page on ipSpace.net might help you get IPv6-fluent (hint: don’t miss the <strong>must-read documents </strong>section).</p>
