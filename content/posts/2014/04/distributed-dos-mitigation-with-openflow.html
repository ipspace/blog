<p>Distributed DoS mitigation is another one of the “<em>we were doing SDN without knowing it</em>” cases: <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2009/jul/6/remotely-triggered-black-hole-rtbh-routing/">remote-triggered black holes</a> are used by most major ISPs, and <a href="https://www.nanog.org/sites/default/files/wed.general.trafficdiversion.serodio.10.pdf">BGP Flowspec</a> was available for years. Not surprisingly, <a href="http://packetpushers.net/openflow-1-0-actual-use-case-rtbh-of-ddos-traffic-while-keeping-the-target-online/">people started using OpenFlow</a> to implement the same concept (there’s even a <a href="https://www.bro.org/development/projects/pacf.html">proposal to integrate OpenFlow support into Bro IDS</a>).</p>
