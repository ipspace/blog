<p>Friday roundtables are one of the best parts of the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/03/thank-you-troopers.html">Troopers conference</a> – this year we were busy discussing (among other things) how safe the hypervisors are as compared to more traditional network isolation paradigms.</p>
<p><strong>TL&amp;DR summary</strong>: If someone manages to break into your virtualized infrastructure, he’ll probably find easier ways to hop around than hypervisor exploits.<!--more--></p>
<p>There are two obvious potential causes for concern (forgetting for the moment the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Performance_interference_and_noisy_neighbors"><em>noisy neighbor</em></a><em> </em>challenges) when considering hypervisor security from a networking engineer’s point of view:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Improper implementation of inter-VM or network-level isolation (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLAN_hopping">VLAN hopping</a>, anyone?)</li>
<li>Exploits of control-plane vulnerabilities – every time there’s a communication channel between the guest and the host, there’s a potential to explore a buggy host implementation (<a href="http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-252/Vmware.html">VMware tools</a>, anyone?)</li>
</ul>
<p>You’re probably familiar with the network-side control-plane vulnerabilities, from <a href="http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityNotice/CVE-2013-5507">denial-of-service attacks triggered by specially crafted packets</a>, to brutally simple things like <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/11/virtual-switches-need-bpdu-guard.html">sending a BPDU packet from a VM</a>. Communication between hypervisor host operating system (or Hyper-V root partition) and guest VMs is no different. For example, it’s pretty easy to burn CPU cycles on a Hyper-V host by sending enormous amounts of IPv6 RA, IPv6 ND or ARP requests, and it may still be possible to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-092">crash the hypervisor with invalid function call parameters</a>.</p>
<p>So every time I hear “<em>H</em><em>ypervisors are not secure enough</em>” I ask “<em>A</em><em>s compared to what?</em>” Hypervisors are obviously less secure than air-gapped networks, but are they less secure than VRFs? I’m not sure.</p>
<p>Some conclusions are evident: if your security policy requires a separate set of physical switches for different security zones, you shouldn’t taint that separation by connecting the same hypervisor host to both zones (claiming multiple NICs result in a good-enough separation is somewhat naïve, as <a href="http://bradhedlund.com/2010/02/10/vswitch-illusion-dmz-virtualization/">explained in another great post by Brad Hedlund</a>). </p>
<p>On the other hand, if you’re using different VRFs on the same physical switches for different security zones, you probably shouldn’t require separate hypervisor clusters for those same security zones. After all, every host (or VM) residing in those security zones can communicate with the physical switches and try to exploit them.</p>
<p>In the end, there’s no perfect security; it’s all about recognizing threats, evaluating risks and identifying the weakest links. Most security breaches rely on ancient exploits like SQL injections, and operator errors still represent a major source of failures. </p>
<p>Finally, as <a href="https://twitter.com/bsdaemon">Rodrigo Branco</a> pointed out during the roundable, an intruder doesn’t need a complex hypervisor exploit to move laterally after the first break-in, there are <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/compromised-security-zone-game-over-or.html">numerous infinitely easier ways of doing that</a>. </p>
