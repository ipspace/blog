title: Connecting Virtual Routers to the Outside World

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sdekooter/en">Stefan de Kooter</a> (@sdktr) sent me a follow-up question to my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/02/going-all-virtual-with-virtual-wan-edge.html"><em>Going All Virtual with Virtual WAN Edge Routers</em></a> blog post:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">How would one interface with external Internet in this scenario? I totally get the virtual network assets mantra, but even a virtual BGP router would need to get a physical interconnect one way or another.</blockquote>
<p>As always, there are plenty of solutions depending on your security needs.<!--more--></p>
<h4>Setting the mindset</h4><p>Please read the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/02/going-all-virtual-with-virtual-wan-edge.html"><em>Going All Virtual with WAN Edge Routers</em></a> blog post before continuing, and keep in mind that most private cloud deployments don’t need more than two ToR switches connecting dozens of high-density servers. This blog post is focusing on reasonably sized Greenfield private cloud scenario (and your mileage may vary).</p>
<h4>Connect the Internet links to your ToR data center switches</h4><p>This design is the easiest to implement: don’t use WAN edge routers, plug the Internet uplinks straight into a dedicated VRF configured on the ToR switches, run BGP on the ToR switches, and do the basic traffic scrubbing with an inbound ACL.</p>
<div class="separator"><a href="/2014/09/s1600-VR+Internet+VRF.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="/2014/09/s400-VR+Internet+VRF.jpg"/></a></div>
<p>Potential drawbacks: </p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>You can’t get anything close to full Internet routing table into the forwarding hardware of a ToR switch;</li>
<li>Some data center switches don’t run BGP at all, others have limited set of BGP features available;</li>
<li>Internet (outside) and inside segments are on the same switch – but then many organizations use the same approach with physical firewalls dual-connected to the same switch.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Use the ToR switch to connect Internet link to an <em>outside </em>VLAN</h4><p>Like in the previous design, plug the Internet uplink into a port on a ToR switch, but don’t run that port in a VRF, but in a L2-only VLAN that extends to the hypervisor host with the virtual router.</p>
<div class="separator"><a href="/2014/09/s1600-VR+Internet+on+Trunk.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="/2014/09/s400-VR+Internet+on+Trunk.png"/></a></div>
<p>Advantages (as compared to the previous design):</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>ToR switch does not run IP in the Internet VLAN, so it’s impossible to crash it with a malformed IP packet;</li>
<li>An attacker cannot send traffic to the control plane of the ToR switch (all L3 traffic is forwarded to hosts/VMs in the same VLAN).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Use a dedicated interface on the hypervisor host</h4><p>In the previous design we used a trunk interface to bring the Internet VLAN to the hypervisor host (similar to one-armed firewall design). We could enforce stricter traffic separation by using a dedicated hypervisor host interface for the outside segment, and use a dedicated virtual switch within the host to link the virtual router (or firewall) to that interface.</p>
<div class="separator"><a href="/2014/09/s1600-VR+Internet+VLAN.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="/2014/09/s400-VR+Internet+VLAN.png"/></a></div>
<p class="warn">This design does prevent accidental inter-segment traffic leaking due to fat fingers (or misconfigured promiscuous mode) but does not increase protection against hypervisor bugs, as <a href="http://bradhedlund.com/2010/02/10/vswitch-illusion-dmz-virtualization/">all virtual switches share the same code base</a> (and sometimes even the same data structures). </p>
<p>If an intruder manages to crash the hypervisor host with a malformed packet, you’ll be dead in the water regardless of how many virtual switches you use. On the other hand, I haven’t heard of a single exploit that would crash the hypervisor by sending a crafted packet to a VM, whereas there’ve been plenty of cases where a router would crash when served a properly malformed packet.</p>
<h4>Connect the Internet uplink straight into a hypervisor host</h4><p>If your security policy dictates a strict separation between outside and inside segments (example: you’d use multiple physical switches for different segments in a DMZ), plug the Internet uplink straight into a spare interface of the hypervisor host.</p>
<div class="separator"><a href="/2014/09/s1600-VR+Internet+vSwitch.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="/2014/09/s400-VR+Internet+vSwitch.png"/></a></div>
<p>In this design, the Internet traffic never reaches the ToR switch, so it’s marginally safer than previous designs, but I think we’re already deep into the paranoia land at this point.</p>
<h4>Connect the Internet uplink straight to the virtual router NIC</h4><p>Finally, you could use hypervisor bypass to connect the virtual router straight to the physical NIC (or a Virtual Function of a SR-IOV-capable NIC). </p>
<div class="separator"><a href="/2014/09/s1600-VR+Internet+NIC.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="/2014/09/s400-VR+Internet+NIC.png"/></a></div>
<p>In both cases the virtual router has to support the physical NIC (= it has to have the proper device drivers), which might be a challenge if the vendor relies on using <a href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=1001805">VMXNET3</a> or <a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Virtio">virtio</a> drivers. The only exceptions (that I know of) are:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Cisco’s Palo ASIC which looks exactly like VMXNET3 device when used in VM-FEX mode (that’s why you can <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/03/cisco-vmware-merging-virtual-and.html">use vMotion with VMDirectPath</a>); </li>
