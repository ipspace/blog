<p>The <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/06/snabb-switch-and-nfv-on-openstack-in.html">pilot episode</a> of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild podcast</a> featuring <a href="http://www.snabb.co">Snabb Switch</a> created plenty of additional queries (and thousands of downloads) – it was obviously time for another <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/www.ipSpace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_7-Snabb_Switch_Deep_Dive.mp3">deep dive episode</a> discussing the intricate innards of this interesting virtual switch.</p>
<p>During the deep dive <a href="http://www.lukego.com">Luke Gorrie</a>, the mastermind behind the <a href="http://www.snabb.co">Snabb Switch</a>, answered a long list of questions, including:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Is SnabbSwitch a framework or a product that I could download and use?</li>
<li>How do I configure it? How do I change the configuration?</li>
<li>How can I implement my own forwarding logic? Do I need to program it or can I reuse existing elements?</li>
<li>Can I add new networking protocols or NIC device drivers?</li>
<li>How can scripting code included in a configuration file forward packets between two 10GE interfaces at line rate?</li>
<li>What is the difference between kernel- and user space packet forwarding on Linux?</li>
<li>Why is polling faster than interrupt-based packet processing?</li>
<li>How do you push 200 Gbps out of a server with 10% CPU load?</li>
<li>What’s the difference between Snabb Switch and Intel DPDK?</li>
<li>How does Snabb Switch integrate with OpenStack?</li>
<li>How can you use SR-IOV to get blazingly fast I/O performance in virtualized environments?</li>
</ul>
<p>Other interesting tidbits covered in the podcast:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>From the hardware perspective, you should be able to push half a Tbps through an Intel server, hilariously low forwarding rates we’re seeing on some products today are a software problem;</li>
<li>Imagine your switch behaving like a browser executing user-developed JavaScript;</li>
<li>Did you know that Snabb Switch uses the same technology as CloudFlare in its DoS prevention tools?</li>
<li>Why it makes sense to focus on a very specific hardware platform instead of portability to all possible hardware out there.</li>
</ul>
