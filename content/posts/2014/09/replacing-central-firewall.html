title: Replacing a Central Firewall

<p>During one of my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/ExpertExpress">ExpertExpress engagements</a> I got an interesting question: “<em>could we replace a pair of central firewalls with iptables on the Linux server?</em>” </p>
<p>Short answer: Maybe (depending on your security policy), but I’d still love to see <a href="/2010/08/i-dont-need-no-stinking-firewall-or-do.html">some baseline scrubbing</a> before the traffic hits the server – after all, if someone pwns your server, he’ll quickly turn off <em>iptables</em>.<!--more--></p>
<p>During the engagement we continued to discuss various tools we could use, from packet filters to reflexive access lists and full-blown stateful solutions, both in physical and virtual form, and ended up with a design that combined stateful filters on the servers with stateless packet filters in WAN edge devices and hypervisors.</p>
<p>A new <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/ExpertExpress_Case_Studies">ExpertExpress case study</a> published on ipSpace.net <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Replacing_the_Central_Firewall">summarizes these options and describes several high-level designs</a> you could use depending on how secure you want your infrastructure to be.</p>
