<p>If you’re a regular reader of my blog, you know that I spent a lot of time during the last three years <a href="/2013/11/two-and-half-years-after-openflow-debut.html">debunking SDN myths</a>, explaining the <a href="/2014/06/is-openflow-best-tool-for-overlay.html">limitations of OpenFlow</a> and <a href="/2013/04/the-many-paths-to-sdn.html">pointing out other technologies</a> one could use to <a href="/2013/11/programming-network-few-guidelines.html">program the network</a>.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2014 I organized my <a href="/tag/sdn.html">SDN</a>- and <a href="/tag/openflow.html">OpenFlow</a>-related blog posts into a <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN_and_OpenFlow">digital book</a>. I want to make this information as useful and as widely distributed as possible – for a limited time you can <a href="http://cms.ipspace.net/bin/enroll?id=xSDNReality">download the PDF free of charge</a>.</p>
