title: Dynamic FCoE – Sparse-Mode FCoE Strikes Again

---

<p>A while ago Cisco added <em>dynamic FCoE </em>support to Nexus 5000 switches. It sounded interesting and I wanted to talk about it in my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics">Data Center Fabrics</a> update session, but I couldn’t find any documentation at that time.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5500/sw/fcoe/7x/b_5500_FCoE_Config_7x/b_5500_FCoE_Config_7x_chapter_0101.html">Configuring Dynamic FCoE Using FabricPath</a> configuration guide appeared on Cisco’s web site and J Metz <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/what-is-dynamic-fcoe/">wrote a lengthly blog post explaining how it all works</a>, triggering a severe attack of déjà vu.<!--more--></p>
<p>I called Cisco’s traditional approach to multi-hop FCoE <a href="/2011/06/beauties-of-dense-mode-fcoe/"><em>dense-mode FCoE</em></a> – every switch in the network is a Fibre Channel Forwarder (FCF – Fibre Channel equivalent of a router) with a unique Domain ID participating in FSPF.</p>
<p class="more">Tony Bourke wrote an <a href="http://datacenteroverlords.com/2011/08/16/jinkies-its-an-fcoe-mystery/">even more structured blog post on multihop FCoE topologies</a>. Definitely worth reading.</p>
<p>Dynamic FCoE is Cisco’s implementation of <a href="/2010/08/multihop-fcoe-101/"><em>sparse-mode FCoE</em></a> (note that my blog post describing it is four years old) – the leaf switches (Nexus 5000s) are FCFs, core switches provide layer-2 FabricPath-based transport between the leaf switches. There really is nothing new under the sun ;)</p>
<p><strong>Does dynamic FCoE make sense?</strong> It depends. If you’re willing to trust the layer-2 transport fabric and treat storage as yet another application on top of Ethernet+IP, dynamic FCoE makes perfect sense, but keep in mind that you’ll have as much visibility into underlying transport fabric as with iSCSI or NFS… or overlay virtual networks.</p>
<h4>More information</h4><p>FCoE is just one of the many topics described in the storage section of my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_3.0_for_Networking_Engineers">Data Center 3.0 for Networking Engineers webinar</a>.</p>
