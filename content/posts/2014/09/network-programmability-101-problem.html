<p>In the first part of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Network_Programmability_101">Network Programmability</a> webinar <a href="http://keepingitclassless.net/">Matt Oswalt</a> described some of the major challenges most networks are facing today:</p>

<li>Is that really the case? Why?</li>
<li>Why is the manual configuration culture so widespread in networking?</li>
<li>How does the holistic thinking in the design phase dissolve into the box mentality of CLI commands?</li>
<li>How does the box mentality limit the scalability of network deployments?</li>
</ul>
