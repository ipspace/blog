<p>A while ago Rick Parker told me about his amazing project: he started a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Enterprise-Cloud/">meetup group</a> that will build a reference private/hybrid cloud heavily relying on virtualized network services, and publish all documentation related to their effort, from high-level architecture to device and software configurations, and wiring plans.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_8-Hybrid_Cloud_Reference_Architecture.mp3">Episode 8 of Software Gone Wild</a> Rick told us more about his project, and we simply couldn’t avoid a long list of topics including:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Once you virtualize servers, virtualizing routers and network appliances is the logical next step;</li>
<li>If you use Juniper SRX in VM format (<a href="http://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/security/firefly-perimeter/#features-benefits">Firefly Perimeter</a>), you can build a private cloud with no routers (as SRX includes Junos routing functionality);</li>
<li>Do private clouds exist? Note: I guess this question could only be asked in one <a href="http://it20.info/2012/09/cloud-and-the-three-it-geographies-silicon-valley-us-and-rest-of-the-world/">slightly-biased geography</a>;</li>
<li>Storage: the biggest pain in hybrid cloud deployments;</li>
<li>How do you orchestrate a hybrid cloud?</li>
<li>Can you build a data center architecture where you can shut down one or more data centers for maintenance during business hours?</li>
<li>Can you reach 100% availability with enterprise applications?</li>
</ul>
