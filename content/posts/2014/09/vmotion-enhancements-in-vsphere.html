<p>VMware <a href="http://wahlnetwork.com/2014/08/26/vmotion-enhancements-vsphere-6-announced/">announced several vMotion enhancements in vSphere 6</a>, ranging from “finally” to “interesting”.</p>
<p><strong>vMotion across virtual switches</strong>. Finally. The tricks you had to use previous were absolutely bizarre.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>vMotion across routed networks</strong>. Finally someone learned how to spell <em>routing</em>. What really bothers me about this one is that vMotion across routed networks worked forever (probably relying on proxy ARP), it just wasn't supported. I was always wondering what the real reason for the lack of support was – maybe they had to implement VRF-like functionality to ensure vMotion traffic uses a different routing table than iSCSI or NFS traffic.</p>
<p><strong>vMotion across vCenter servers</strong>. This one is a clear illustration of how stupid the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/01/long-distance-vmotion-stretched-ha.html">long-distance vMotion ideas were</a>. If you wanted to do vMotion across multiple data centers, they had to use a single vCenter, making them a single management-plane failure domain (not to mention the minor challenge of losing control of all but one data center if the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/10/if-something-can-fail-it-will.html">DCI link fails</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Long-distance vMotion</strong>, which now tolerates 100 msec RTT. As expected, it took approximately 10 femtoseconds before a VMware EVP started promoting vMotion between East- and West Coast (details somewhere in the middle of <a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org/2014/08/26/vmworld-2014-day-2-keynote/">this blog post</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Note to VMware</strong>: just because you fixed your TCP stack (which is good), long-distance vMotion makes absolutely no more sense than it did before… not that I would ever expect some people promoting it to understand the nuances of why that’s so.</p>
