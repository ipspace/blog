<p>I hope you know TCP provides a <em>reliable stream service </em>not <em>reliable packet delivery</em>, but you might not have realized all the implications â€“ I found an old post by <a href="http://blog.erratasec.com/">Robert Graham</a> explaining how <a href="http://blog.erratasec.com/2014/04/fun-with-ids-funtime-3-heartbleed.html">things <em>really </em>work</a> and how you can use them to bypass quick-and-dirty IDS that rely on signatures instead of doing proper protocol decodes.</p>
