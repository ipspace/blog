<p>Some OpenFlow-focused startups are <a href="http://www.bigswitch.com/blog/2014/06/02/modern-openflow-and-sdn-part-ii">desperately trying to tell you how redundant their architecture is</a>. Unfortunately all the whitepapers (and the prancing unicorns) cannot change a simple fact: an SDN controller (OpenFlow-based or otherwise) is in some aspects a single failure domain.<!--more--></p>
<h4>But the controller cluster will save the day</h4><p>No, it won’t. A controller cluster will protect you against hardware failures, which are probably the last 1% of all failures you’ll encounter (if that’s not the case, change the hardware). A cluster will not protect you against software failures (= bugs) or operator mistakes (= fat fingers).</p>
<p>An active/standby controller cluster might be less sensitive than an active/active one. If the active controller crashes, the standby controller takes over (similar to supervisor failover in most high-end switches) and starts with a fresh copy of the data structures. Controllers in an active-active cluster might share the data structures and thus be affected by the same bug at the same time.</p>
<p>A controller crash might also be triggered by a malformed packet, or even a perfectly valid one – decades ago one of my hosts generated a legitimate ARP packet that consistently crashed next-hop Cisco router. In this case, it’s reasonable to expect the backup controller to crash as soon as it takes over and receives the same packet from the same host.</p>
<p>Finally there’s the complexity of the clustering software. I haven’t heard of a clustering solution that would provably work under all possible weird conditions (and it’s pretty hard to test all of them); <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/04/should-we-use-redundant-supervisors.html">failovers between supervisor modules</a> are no exceptions.</p>
<p class="note">Obviously, if there’s a perfect clustering solution out there, please write a comment.</p>
<h4>What can we do?</h4><p>The solutions to this challenge are well known:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Distributed systems are more resilient than centralized ones;</li>
<li>Loosely coupled systems (example: <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/10/exception-routing-with-bgp-sdn-done.html">BGP SDN</a>) are more resilient than tightly coupled ones (example: <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/09/openflow-fabric-controllers-are-light.html">OpenFlow controller</a>);</li>
<li><a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/5.20%20-%20Plexxi%20Affinity%20Networking.mp4">Network infrastructure <em>enhanced </em>by a controller</a> is more resilient than one that relies on a controller to operate;</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/05/complexity-belongs-to-network-edge.html">Complexity at the edge of the network</a> scales better than centralized complexity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not surprisingly, scalable SDN solutions from <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/05/openflow-google-brilliant-but-not.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.nanog.org/sites/default/files/wed.general.brainslug.lapukhov.20.pdf">Microsoft</a> and (supposedly) Facebook, as well as some network virtualization solutions use most or all of these principles.</p>
