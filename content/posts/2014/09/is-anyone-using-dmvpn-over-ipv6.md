One of my readers sent me an interesting challenge: they're deploying a new DMVPN WAN, and as they cannot expect all locations to have native (non-NAT) IPv4 access, they plan to build the new DMVPN over IPv6. He was wondering whether it would work.

Apart from "*you're definitely going in the right direction*" all I could tell him was "*looking at the documentation I couldn't see why it wouldn't work*" Has anyone deployed DMVPN over IPv6 in a production network? Any hiccups? Please share your experience in the comments. Thank you!
