<p>I love reading blog posts on <a href="http://www.plexxi.com/blog/">Plexxi blog</a> (you SHOULD add them to your RSS reader) and the “<a href="http://www.plexxi.com/2014/09/applications-stupid-part-1-3/">It’s the Application, Stupid</a>” series from Mat Matthews is no exception. What pleasantly surprised me was that a large enterprise came to the same <a href="/2013/11/typical-enterprise-application/">conclusions</a> I’m <a href="/2014/09/youve-been-doing-same-thing-for-last-20/">preaching for the last few years</a>.</p>
