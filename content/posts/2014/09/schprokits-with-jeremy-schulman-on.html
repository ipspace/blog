<p>Jeremy Schulman was the driving force behind the Puppet agent that Juniper implemented on some Junos switches (one of the first fully supported Puppet-on-a-switch implementations). In the meantime, he quit Juniper and started his own company focused on a network automation product – more than enough reasons to <a href="http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_10-Schprokits_with_Jeremy_Schulman.mp3">chat with him on Software Gone Wild</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>We couldn’t help but start with Puppet agent on Junos:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Why did Juniper create a Puppet agent on a switch?</li>
<li>Why was it limited to creating VLANs?</li>
<li>How can you limit the changes an automation tool can trigger?</li>
<li>Why is Junos API the same as manually typing the commands?</li>
</ul>
<p>Jeremy also told us a lot about his new baby:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>What is Schprokits?</li>
<li>What are the basic ideas and concepts Schprokits uses?</li>
<li>How is Schprokits different from Puppet, Chef &amp; Co? How is it different from Tail-f NCS?</li>
<li>Which vendors does it support? How horrible are their APIs?</li>
<li>Why is it (among other things) yet another template building tool?</li>
<li>How is Schprokits reducing the execution gap… and what is the execution gap?</li>
<li>Does Schprokits have an OpenStack demo and why does that question sound like turtles all the way down?</li>
<li>When will we see the product? Can I download it and play with it?</li>
<li>Will Schprokits be an open-source product? What’s the go-to-market strategy?</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we couldn’t resist going down a whole field of rabbit holes:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>What is the difference between DevOps and NetOps?</li>
<li>What is a blast radius and why is it important?</li>
<li>Why is it hard to use configuration management tools like Chef, Puppet or Ansible in networking?</li>
<li>What is YAML and why is it better than JSON or XML?</li>
<li>Why is screen scraping a really awful idea?</li>
<li>What is the architecture of disagreement in networking?</li>
<li>Why will we never agree on the northbound API?</li>
<li>Why is “we have an API to do that” not always the right answer?</li>
<li>What does “idempotent” mean… and do we really have to learn all these crazy new words?</li>
</ul>
