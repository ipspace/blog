When we were discussing my autumn travel plans, my lovely wife asked me "*What are you going to talk about in* [*Bern*](https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/08/see-you-in-bern-on-september-9th.html)*?*" She has a technical background, but I didn't feel like going into the intricacies of SDN, SDDC and NetOps, so I told her the essence of my keynote speech:

> I'm trying to tell people that all the technology in the world won't save them unless they change their mentality and re-architect their broken processes.

She started laughing and said "*You've been doing the same thing for the last 20 years. Initially it was security, now it seems to be SDN*"... and all of a sudden, it all made perfect sense.

The [presentation I had in Bern](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get?id=From%20Traditional%20Silos%20to%20SDDC.pdf) is available with [free subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free). Also: check out my [public presentations](http://www.ipspace.net/Presentations#Cloud_Networking) page.
