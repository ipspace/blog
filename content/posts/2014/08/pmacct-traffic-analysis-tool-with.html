<p>SDN evangelists talking about <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/05/openflow-google-brilliant-but-not.html">centralized traffic engineering</a>, flow steering or <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/02/bandwidth-on-demand-is-openflow-silver.html">bandwidth calendaring</a> sometimes tend to gloss over the first rule of successful traffic engineering: Know Thy Traffic.</p>
<p>In a world ruled by OpenFlow you’d <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/01/network-monitoring-with-openflow.html">expect the OpenFlow controller to know all the traffic</a>; in more traditional networks we use technologies like NetFlow, sFlow or IPFIX to report the traffic statistics – but regardless of the underlying mechanism, you need a tool that will collect the statistics, aggregate them in a way that makes them usable to the network operators, report them, and potentially act on the deviations.<!--more--></p>
<p>There are plenty of commercial traffic analysis tools on the market, but many large networks (including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VnwwkZG1n8">some humongous ones</a>) prefer a very powerful open-source alternative: <a href="http://www.pmacct.net">pmacct</a>.</p>
<p>In the fifth episode of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild podcast</a>, we talked with <a href="http://es.linkedin.com/pub/paolo-lucente/30/6bb/854">Paolo Lucente</a>, the author of pmacct. We started with <a href="http://www.pmacct.net/pmacct-stepsforward.pdf">the history</a>, continued with the internal architecture of the tool, and mentioned some of the interesting use cases.</p>
