<p>After a week of testing, I decided to move the main ipSpace.net web site (<a href="http://www.ipspace.net">www.ipspace.net</a>) as well as some of the resource servicing hostnames to CloudFlare CDN. Everything should work fine, but if you experience any problems with my web site, please <a href="http://cms.ipspace.net/bin/contact?StySu=CloudFlare+Is+Broken">let me know ASAP</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Collateral benefit</strong>: ipSpace.net is now fully accessible over IPv6.</p>
