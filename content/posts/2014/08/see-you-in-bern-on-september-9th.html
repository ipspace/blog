<p>She was kind enough to invite me as the <a href="http://www.sig-switzerland.ch/dc_speaker_en.html">keynote speaker</a> (it’s pretty easy to guess what I’ll talk about) and will be around for the whole day to discuss data center design challenges, SDN, network programmability, or whatever else you’d like to talk about.</p>
<p>I hope to see you in real life in Bern (but you do have to <a href="http://www.sig-switzerland.ch/dc_registration_en.html">register first</a>).</p>
