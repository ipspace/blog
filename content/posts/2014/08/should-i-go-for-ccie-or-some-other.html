title: Should I Go for CCIE or Some Other Certification?

<p>One of my readers sent me this question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I am already CCIE and work as a network engineer with pretty good salary. But I think that I am losing some passion for Cisco networking and have interests in many other technologies. Currently I am very interested in Linux and Python development. Is it worth to add some Red Hat certification along CCIE or should I pursue another CCIE?</blockquote>
<p>I think “<em>should I go for CCIE or RHCE</em>” is the wrong question.<!--more--></p>
<p>Before jumping into another certification process, you should ask yourself a few questions:</p>
<ul class="Bullet1"><li>Why would you go for another certification?</li>
<li>What do you expect to gain by doing that?</li>
<li>Which area are you interested in?</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I don’t think it makes much sense to go for another certification after CCIE just to become certified in something else. Pursuing a certification to progress along a training plan (or set of topics) is a different story, but even then, it doesn’t make much sense to walk down a path that you have no need for at the moment.</p>
<p>It’s way better to find a problem that you’re interested in, work on the problem, identify your shortcoming while doing that, study hard to master the tools or technologies you’ve identified as crucial (<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/08/road-to-complex-designs-is-paved-with.html">Googling for recipes</a> doesn’t count), solve the problem, and move on. You might not get another certification to add to your CV when <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2008/12/random-scenic-route-certification.html">following this path</a>, but you will get a <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2008/09/knowledge-or-recipes.html">fundamental understanding</a> of the technologies and tools you’re using.</p>
<p class="info">We discussed similar topics in one of the recent <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone Wild episodes</a>. Can’t remember which one it was – you’ll have to listen to all of them ;)</p>
