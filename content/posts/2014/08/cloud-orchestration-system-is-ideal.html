title: Cloud Orchestration System Is an Ideal Controller Use Case

<p>A while ago I explained why <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/06/is-openflow-best-tool-for-overlay.html">OpenFlow might be a wrong tool for some jobs</a>, and why <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/05/does-centralized-control-plane-make.html">centralized control plane might not make sense</a>, and <a href="http://cyberpunkture.net/2014/06/on-centralized-sdn-and-openflow/">quickly got misquoted as saying “controllers don’t scale”</a>. Nothing could be further from the truth, properly architected controller-based architectures can reach enormous scale – Amazon VPC is the best possible example.<!--more--></p>

<h4>Cloud Orchestration System as Overlay Virtual Networking Controller</h4><p>The orchestration system in an IP-aware IaaS cloud architecture has <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/11/layer-2-and-layer-3-switching-in-vmware.html">all the information we need to set up forwarding entries</a> in an overlay virtual networking implementation:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Hypervisor-to-VTEP (transport IP address) mapping</li>
<li>VM-to-hypervisor or container-to-host mapping</li>
<li>MAC-to-VM or MAC-to-container mapping</li>
<li>IP-to-VM or IP-to-container, and consequently IP-to-MAC (ARP) mapping</li>
<li>Subnets and other connectivity needs of individual tenants</li>
<li>Security requirements of individual VMs and tenants</li>
</ul>
<p class="info">Dynamic/floating IP addresses and VM mobility might introduce some hiccups into this rosy picture, but let’s ignore them for a moment.</p>
<p>Some cloud orchestration systems push this information straight into hypervisors (example: Hyper-V System Center Virtual Machine Manager). More scalable architectures replace a single instance of the orchestration system with a scale-out controller cluster relying on back-end database (probably what Amazon VPC and Azure are using). For extra boost in scalability, replace transactional back-end database with eventually consistent distributed database, which is usually good enough in <a href="http://it20.info/2011/04/tcp-clouds-udp-clouds-design-for-fail-and-aws/">large-scale UDP clouds</a> (don't tell me I just reinvented MPLS/VPN - I'm well aware of that analogy ;).</p>
<p>Other implementations use more convoluted approaches, from layered controllers (example: NSX controller for OpenStack) to centralized control planes (example: Cisco Nexus 1000V). Layered controllers add complexity, but still perform remarkably well as long as they stay on the management plane. The moment a controller starts dealing with the real-time aspects of <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/08/management-control-and-data-planes-in.html">control- or data plane</a>, its scalability plummets.</p>
<h4>A Few Data Points</h4><p>What I wrote above should be common sense to anyone who spent time researching or implementing large-scale networking architectures. Do we see the same trend in real-life implementations? Here are some data points from well-known commercial products.</p>
<p>Products that stay out of the control- and data plane:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>A <a href="http://networkheresy.com/2013/05/30/scale-sdn-and-network-virtualization/">cluster of three NSX controllers can manage up to 3000 hosts</a>, a cluster of five controllers up to 5000 hosts (supported numbers given in NSX release notes are lower, but you get the idea);</li>
<li>A single System Center Virtual Machine Manager (using Hyper-V Powershell API) <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/systemcenter/en-US/a02b3ab0-64d1-4cad-805d-943023c53a9c/scvmm-scale-numbers?forum=virtualmachingmgrhyperv">can manage up to 400 hosts</a> (this is not a hard number);</li>
<li>VMware virtual distributed switch (vDS) can span 1000 hosts with vSphere 5.5 (350 in vSphere 5.1);</li>
</ul>
<p>Products with centralized control plane:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Cisco Nexus 1000V VSM can <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus1000/sw/4_2_1_s_v_2_2_3/release/notes/n1000v_rn.html#pgfId-64826">control 128 hosts in recent release</a> (64 hosts in older releases);</li>
<li>Last I heard ProgrammableFlow controller controls up to 200 switches.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">I never got the maximum number of Hyper-V virtual switches PF6800 controller supports, the <a href="http://www.necam.com/docs/?id=67c33426-0a2b-4b87-9a7a-d3cecc14d26a">online brochure</a> has zero technical details, and the documentation is still not public.</p>
<p>Comparing vDS and Nexus 1000V maximums is particularly entertaining. You could believe that:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>VMware understands networking better than Cisco does;</li>
<li>VMware programmers write better networking code than Cisco’s programmers;</li>
<li>VMware cares more about scalability of virtual networking than Cisco</li>
</ul>
<p>… or you could accept the fact that there are some fundamental architectural differences between the two products that affect scalability. Do I need to say more?</p>
