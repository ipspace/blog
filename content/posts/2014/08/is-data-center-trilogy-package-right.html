title: Is Data Center Trilogy Package the Right Fit to Understand Long Distance vMotion
  Challenges?

<p>A reader sent me this question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">My company will have 10GE dark fiber across our DCs with possibly OTV as the DCI. The VM team has also expressed interest in DC-to-DC vMotion (&lt;4ms). Based on your blogs it looks like overall you don't recommend long-distance vMotion across DCI. Will the "<a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_trilogy">Data Center trilogy</a>" package be the right fit to help me better understand why?</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, long-distance vMotion seems to be a <a href="http://wahlnetwork.com/2014/08/26/vmotion-enhancements-vsphere-6-announced/">persistent craze that peaks with a predicable period of approximately 12 months</a>, and while it seems nothing can inoculate your peers against it, having technical arguments might help.<!--more--></p>
<p>Considering the webinars in the <em>Data Center Trilogy </em>package, the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Interconnects">DCI</a> webinar will be the most helpful, and the other two will give you plenty of background knowledge, which will also come handy when talking with the virtualization engineers.</p>
<p class="info">Speaking of bundles, you might find the whole <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Roadmap/Data_center_webinars">Data Center Roadmap bundle</a> more interesting – it also includes the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics">Data Center Fabrics</a> and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Clos_fabrics_explained">Clos (Leaf-and-Spine) Fabrics</a> webinars.</p>
<p>Continuing with the questions from the same email:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Does the "Load Balancing and Scale-Out Application Architectures" webinar come with the DC trilogy package? </blockquote>
<p>Yes, it’s part of the Data Center 3.0 webinar.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Lastly, I'm thinking even if latency and bandwidth were a non-issue with 10GE DCI, we'd have other DC-to-DC vMotion issues (e.g. asymmetrical routing, traffic trombone, firewall and load balancer state issues, storage/LUN implications, etc), correct?</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely, and then there’s the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/04/distributed-firewalls-how-badly-do-you.html">danger of split subnets</a>. Unfortunately, as we cannot ignore bandwidth and latency, we have to deal with <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/05/data-has-mass-and-gravity.html">data gravity challenges</a>, and the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/09/long-distance-vmotion-for-disaster.html">overall impossibility of moving huge amounts of RAM</a> VMs use (even in a small-to-medium data center) across a WAN link.</p>
<p>Oh, and finally, don’t forget that DC-to-DC vMotion <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/01/long-distance-vmotion-stretched-ha.html">might not have any real underlying business need</a>, but appears as a requirement simply because other people want to make their lives easier, while <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/05/layer-2-network-is-single-failure.html">forcing you to make the network less stable</a>.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Designing_Private_Cloud_Infrastructure#Roadmap">An upcoming webinar will cover active/active data center designs</a>; at that time I’ll add a related chapter in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Design_Case_Studies">Data Center Design Case Studies</a> book;</li>
<li>We can always <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/ExpertExpress">organize an online session</a> with your virtualization or application teams to discuss the viability of long-distance vMotion and other disaster recovery solutions. It’s amazing how much progress you can make once people start talking with each other. </li>
