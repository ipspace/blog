<p>Nexus 1000V release 5.2(1)SV3(1.1) was published on August 22<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">nd</span> (Iâ€™m positive that has nothing to do with VMworld starting tomorrow) and I found this gem in the release notes:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Enabling BPDU guard causes the Cisco Nexus 1000V to detect these spurious BPDUs and shut down the virtual machine adapters (the origination BPDUs), thereby avoiding loops.</blockquote>
<p>It took them <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/11/virtual-switches-need-bpdu-guard.html">almost three years</a>, but we finally have BPDU guard on a layer-2 virtual switch (<a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/09/dear-vmware-bpdu-filter-bpdu-guard.html">why does it matter</a>). Nice!</p>
