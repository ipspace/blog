<p>Most web application developers remain blissfully unaware of the major performance roadblocks their applications face in the wild: access network bandwidth restrictions and unexpectedly high latency (see also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_Distributed_Computing">Fallacies of Distributed Computing</a> with an <a href="http://www.rgoarchitects.com/Files/fallacies.pdf">in-depth explanation</a>). The impact of these two roadblocks is further amplified by behavior of TCP and HTTP, the protocols used by almost all web applications.</p>
<p>These issues are well documented in my <a href="/2012/02/going-back-to-ivory-tower.html"><em>Scalable Web Application Design</em></a><em> </em>course and in a <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/TCP,_HTTP_and_SPDY">free  TCP, HTTP and SPDY webinar</a> for those of you who won’t be able to make it to Ljubljana.</p>
