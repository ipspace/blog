title: Redundant Data Center Internet Connectivity â€“ High-Level Design
url: /2013/01/redundant-data-center-internet_15.html

Yesterday I described the roadblocks you might encounter when faced with a seemingly simple challenge:

> In a network with two data centers (connected with a DCI link), ensure the applications in a data center stay reachable even if its Internet links fail.

In the [Solutions Corner](http://www.ipspace.net/Solutions_Corner) (a brand new part of my web site) you'll find a short [high-level design document describing the overall solution](http://www.ipspace.net/Redundant_Data_Center_Internet_Connectivity) and listing the technologies you could use to implement it (you might want to [watch the video](http://demo.ipspace.net/get/X1%20Redundant%20Data%20Center%20Internet%20Connectivity.mp4) before reading the document).
