<p>I asked Martin Casado to check whether I correctly described his HotSDN’12 paper in my Edge and Core OpenFlow post, and he replied with another interesting observation:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">The (somewhat nuanced) issue I would raise is that [...] decoupling [also] allows evolving the edge and core separately. Today, changing the edge addressing scheme requires a wholesale upgrade to the core. </blockquote>
<p class="note">The 6PE architecture (IPv6 on the edge, MPLS in the core) is a perfect example of this concept.<!--more--></p>
<h4>Why does it matter?</h4><p>Traditional scalable network designs always <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/08/bgpigp-network-design-principles.html">have at least two layers</a>: access or aggregation layer, where most of the network services are performed, and core layer, that provides high-speed transport across a stable network core. </p>
<p>In IP-only networks, the core and access routers (aka layer-3 switches) share the same forwarding mechanism (ignoring the option of having default routing in the access layer); if you want to introduce a new protocol (example: IPv6) you have to deploy it on every single router throughout the network, including all core routers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can introduce IPv6, IPX or AppleTalk (not really), or anything else in an MPLS network, without upgrading the core routers. The core routers continue to provide a single function: optimal transport based on MPLS paths signaled by the edge routers (either through LDP, MPLS-TE, MPLS-TP or more creative approaches, including <a href="https://ripe65.ripe.net/archives/video/51/">NETCONF-configured static MPLS labels</a>).</p>
<p>The same ideas apply to OpenFlow-configured networks. The edge devices have to be smart and support a rich set of flow matching and manipulation functionality; the core (fabric) devices have to match on simple packet tags (VLAN tags, MAC addresses with PBB encapsulation, MPLS tags ...) and provide fast packet forwarding. </p>
<h4>Is this an Ivory Tower dream?</h4><p>Apart from MPLS, there are several real-life SDN implementations of this concept:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Nicira’s NVP is providing virtual networking functionality in OpenFlow-controlled hypervisor switches that use simple IP transport (with STT or GRE encapsulation) across the network core;</li>
<li>Microsoft’s Hyper-V Network Virtualization uses a similar architecture with PowerShell instead of OpenFlow/OVSDB as the hypervisor configuration API;</li>
<li>NEC’s <a href="http://programmableflow.eventbrite.com/">ProgrammableFlow solution</a> uses PF5420 (with 160K OpenFlow entries) at the edge and PF5820 (with 750 full OpenFlow entries and 80K MAC entries) at the core.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">Before you mention VXLAN in the comments: I fail to see something software-defined in a technology that uses flooding to learn dynamic VM-MAC-to-VTEP-IP mappings.</p>
