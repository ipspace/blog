title: Link Aggregation with Stackable Data Center Top-of-Rack Switches

<p>Tomas Kubica made <a href="/2012/11/stackable-data-center-switches-do-math/#c4254865332350305551">an interesting comment</a> to my <a href="/2012/11/stackable-data-center-switches-do-math/"><em>Stackable Data Center Switches</em></a> blog post: “<em>Suppose all your servers have 4x 10G port and you bundle them to LACP NIC team [...] With this stacking link is not going to be used for your inter-server traffic if all servers have active connections to all nodes of your ToR stack.</em>” While he’s technically correct, the idea of having four 10GE ports on each server just to cater to the whims of stackable switches is somewhat hard to sell.<!--more--></p>
<p>However, his comment made me think about the link aggregation behavior between the ToR switches and core (or spine) switches.</p>
<p>I was too tired of writing to write another blog post and decided to produce a short video (I was experimenting with a new mike, so the audio quality is not as good as usual).</p>

<p>And here’s the summary for <a href="/2010/03/qppb-in-mpls-vpn/#c6148862803422882475">differently-attentive</a>:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>All stackable technologies that present multiple ToR switches as a single LACP/STP/routing entity have the same problem. These technologies include Juniper’s Virtual Chassis, HP’s IRF and Brocade’s VCS fabric.</li>
<li>There must be a single port channel between the whole stack and the spine layer, otherwise STP blocks some of the uplinks.</li>
<li>Flow of northbound traffic is usually optimal.</li>
<li>Southbound traffic (toward the servers) will arrive to wrong ToR switch with probability of (N-1)/N where N = number of ToR switches in a stack.</li>
<li>All misdirected southbound traffic will traverse intra-stack links (see the <a href="/2012/11/stackable-data-center-switches-do-math/#comments">original blog post</a> for details).</li>
<li>Worst-case scenarios include iSCSI arrays or database servers reachable through the spine layer.</li>
</ul>
<h4>More information</h4><p>You probably know all this by now, but here it is for the newcomers (warmly welcome!):</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>You’ll find numerous fabric designs guidelines in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Clos_fabrics_explained">Clos Fabrics Explained</a> webinar. </li>
<li>Port densities and fabric behavior of almost all data center switches available from nine major vendors are described in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics">Data Center Fabrics</a> webinar. </li>
</ul>
<p>Both webinars are available as part of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">yearly subscription</a> and you can <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Consulting">always ask me for a second opinion or a design review</a>.</p>
