title: TCP MSS Clamping â€“ What Is It and Why Do We Need It?

This (not so very) short video explains what TCP MSS clamping is and why we're almost forced to use it on xDSL (PPPoE) and tunnel interfaces.

**TL&DW summary**: because Internet-wide Path MTU Discovery rarely works.

### More details

-   [Path MTU discovery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_MTU_Discovery) was first defined in [RFC 1191](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1191.txt) (yeah, it's THAT old and still doesn't work well);
-   You'll find more PMTUD and fragmentation hands-on details in my [Never-Ending Story of IP Fragmentation](/kb/Internet/PMTUD/) article;
-   [Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4821) (RFC 4821) is an alternate approach that does not rely on ICMP replies;
-   [Discovering Path MTU black holes](https://ripe65.ripe.net/presentations/100-RP2_presentation_RIPE65.pdf) presentation from RIPE65 ([video](https://ripe65.ripe.net/archives/video/58/)).

### Some configuration tips

-   TCP MSS clamping can be configured on [end hosts](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/IP-Masquerade-HOWTO/mtu-issues.html) or on some routers (on Cisco IOS, use **ip tcp adjust-mss** interface configuration command).
-   The **ip tcp adjust-mss** functionality on Cisco IOS is bidirectional -- MSS option is adjusted in inbound and outbound TCP SYN packets traversing the interface on which **ip tcp adjust-mss** is configured.
-   You should configure **ip tcp adjust-mss** on interfaces with low MTUs. In other words, MSS value configured on an interface should match MTU value of the same interface minus 40 bytes.
-   [Configuration examples](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk175/tk15/technologies_configuration_example09186a008071a6c3.shtml) where **ip tcp adjust-mss** is configured on Ethernet interface have interesting side effects if the router has more than two interfaces.
