title: NEC Launched a Virtual OpenFlow Switch – Does It Matter?

<p>On January 22<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">nd</span> NEC <a href="https://www.necam.com/About/read.cfm?ID=533d5234-bb3c-41b3-9048-f29b0c992ddc">launched another component of their ProgrammableFlow architecture</a>: a virtual switch for Hyper-V 3.0 environment. The obvious questions to ask would be: (a) why do we care and (b) how’s that different from Nicira or BigSwitch.</p>
<p>TL&amp;DR summary: It depends.<!--more--></p>
<h4>What is it?</h4><p>The ProgrammableFlow 1000 is a virtual switch for the <a href="/2012/12/hyper-v-network-virtualization-wnvnvgre.html">Hyper-V 3.0 environment</a> tightly integrated with the existing ProgrammableFlow physical data center fabric. </p>
<p>It’s also the first OpenFlow virtual switch that works on a non-Linux virtualization platform – Nicira (Open vSwitch), Contrail/Juniper and Midokura have Linux-based virtual switches (<a href="/2012/02/nicira-open-vswitch-inside-vsphereesx.html">Nicira’s VMware hack</a> doesn’t count) that you can use in KVM, Xen or Linux containers-like environments, but not with more traditional enterprise hypervisors.</p>
<p>It’s obvious the (former) startups I just mentioned target large cloud providers (no wonder, you have to show a huge use case if you want to attract VC funding or get acquired), while NEC targets enterprises and their private clouds.</p>
<h4>How is it different from Nicira?</h4><p>Nicira’s NVP focuses on <a href="/2012/02/nicira-bigswitch-nec-openflow-and-sdn.html">hypervisor switches and assumes the underlying physical network provides IP transport or VLANs</a>. NVP does not touch the physical switches – a clear scalability advantage and a clear operational drawback for mid-size enterprise environments.</p>
<p>ProgrammableFlow has a different approach: all physical and virtual switches are controlled by a cluster of ProgrammableFlow controllers. Physical and virtual parts of the data center network are tightly integrated and appear as a single virtual device.</p>
<p>Nicira is ideal for large cloud environments with thousands of servers; ProgrammableFlow is ideal for mid-size enterprises with hundreds of VMs, tens of physical servers and a few switches connecting them together.</p>
<h4>How is it different from BigSwitch?</h4><p>There’s no significant difference from the <a href="/2011/11/big-switch-networks-might-actually-make.html">high-level marketecture perspective</a> ... but in practice there might be a huge gap between theory and practice.</p>
<p>ProgrammableFlow <a href="/2012/02/necibm-enterprise-openflow-you-can.html">has been shipping for more than 18 months</a>, and they probably caught numerous real-life glitches that BigSwitch hasn’t been exposed to yet. Also, NEC decided to tightly integrate their controller with their switches, while BigSwitch works with a <a href="http://www.bigswitch.com/technology-alliance-partners">large ecosystem of partners</a>. Make your own conclusions.</p>
<h4>Finally, does it matter?</h4><p>With all hypervisor vendors loudly jumping on the <a href="/2011/12/decouple-virtual-networking-from.html">overlay networking bandwagon</a> the ProgrammableFlow approach seems to be an <a href="/2012/02/embrace-change-resistance-is-futile.html">evolutionary dead branch</a> given today’s set of facts. </p>
<p>However, operators of mid-sized enterprise data centers just might prefer single integrated and tested configuration/control/management entity over infinitely scalable build-it-yourself one ...and don’t forget that ProgrammableFlow with its VLAN-based encapsulation works with existing firewalls and load balancers, whereas you still need <a href="/2011/10/vxlan-termination-on-physical-devices.html">virtual appliances</a> or <a href="/2012/09/arista-launches-first-hardware-vxlan.html">brand-new hardware</a> to connect the brave new virtual overlay world to the physical reality.</p>
