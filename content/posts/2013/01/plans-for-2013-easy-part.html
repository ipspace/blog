<p>You’ve probably heard all about the <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2012/12/consider-not-setting-goals-in.html">stupidity of setting goals</a> or <a href="http://www.straighttalkonline.com/node/393">management by driving a stake in the ground</a>. While the two contradict each other (no surprise there); it does make sense to know which way one wants to go, so here are some of my ideas for the upcoming year.</p>
<p>However, some great news first:<!--more--></p>
<h4>Podcast (or is it screencast)</h4><p>I was publishing an occasional video every now and then during the last three years ... and it turns out it’s not that hard to make an RSS feed out of them and call it a podcast (or is it a screencast?) ... so I’m proudly presenting <a href="https://feed.ipspace.net">ipSpace.net podcast</a>.</p>
<p>In this podcast you’ll get parts of my webinars (including all the contributions of the guest speakers), other short videos I did in the past, plus plenty of brand new content. Make sure you don’t miss a thing – <a href="https://feed.ipspace.net">subscribe today</a>.</p>
<p>And now for the easy-to-plan ideas:</p>
<h4>Blog posts</h4><p>Nothing much will change, but you’ll probably notice more focus on network design issues that I repeatedly encounter in my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/ExpertExpress">ExpertExpress</a> consulting engagements. Some of these topics will be explained with short videos; sometimes talk-and-scribble is easier than writing a lengthy blog post. </p>
<h4>Webinar topics</h4><p>Data centers, virtualization and overlay networks (with a pinch of SDN) will be the primary focus of my webinars in 2013. There will be the usual Data Center Fabrics update sessions in May and November, one or two overlay networking webinars, and a virtual firewalls and appliances webinar ... and who knows, there might be something useful to discuss on the SDN front after the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/ProgrammableFlow_Technical_Deep_Dive">ProgrammableFlow webinar</a> (it seems NEC’s ProgrammableFlow is still the only production-grade OpenFlow solution).</p>
<p>Then there will be refresher/update sessions. vSphere 5.x networking update is becoming slightly overdue (planned for late spring), and I’ll start working on a total overhaul of Data Center 3.0 webinar – it might take 4-5 separate sessions to cover all the material that has accumulated in the recent years.</p>
<p>Finally, after <a href="http://ipv6transition-rest.eventbrite.com/">describing the IPv6 transition mechanisms</a> I’m probably done with IPv6 for the foreseeable future. There might be a refresh of the introductory webinars, or an update sessions on MAP-E and tweaks in the access networks (assuming they get adopted in the wild), but I simply don’t see another IPv6 topic worthy of an independent webinar. Am I missing something?</p>
<h4>Guest speakers</h4><p>I had fantastic experience with <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/12/webinars-in-2012.html">webinar guest speakers in 2012</a> (and a failure or two you don’t want to hear about), and I’ll try to attract a few guest speakers for the upcoming sessions. </p>
<p>If you’re interested in becoming one of them, just send me an email (you probably already know how to contact me; if not, there’s the “<a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Contact">Contact</a>” link at the top of the screen).</p>
<h4>Events and conferences</h4><p>This part of my regular activities has exploded. I don’t want to become one of the travelling technology minstrels, so I consider the first half of 2013 to be fully booked ... but if you have a great idea about my presentation at your event, <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Contact">get in touch</a> (that’s how I ended up @ <a href="https://www.troopers.de/troopers13/agenda13/troopers13-presentations/index.html">Troopers13</a>, thanks to <a href="http://www.insinuator.net/">Enno Rey</a>).</p>
<p>Autumn seems to be a bit more relaxed and I’m already looking forward to the regular events like <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/02/see-you-plnog-in-warsaw.html">PLNOG</a> and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/10/euronog-2011-nerdy-heaven.html">EuroNOG</a>.</p>
<p>Coming up next: crazier ideas ...</p>
