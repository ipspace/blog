<p>In his <a href="http://www.definethecloud.net/its-our-time-down-here-underlays">recent blog post</a> <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jonisick">Joe Onisick</a> wrote “<em>What network virtualization doesn’t provide, in any form, is a change to the model we use to deploy networks and support applications. [...] All of the same broken or misused methodologies are carried forward. [...] Faithful replication of today’s networking challenges as virtual machines with encapsulation tunnels doesn’t move the bar for deploying applications.</em>”<!--more--></p>
<p>Much as I agree with him, we can’t change much on planet Earth due to the fact that VMs use Ethernet NICs (so we need some form of VLANs to cater to <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/02/microsoft-network-load-balancing-behind.html">infinite creativity of some people</a>), IP addresses (so we need <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/07/bridging-and-routing-is-there.html">L3 forwarding</a>), <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/08/what-went-wrong-tcpip-lacks-session.html">broken TCP stack</a> (requiring load balancers to fix it), and obviously can’t be relied upon to be sufficiently protected (so we need external firewalls). Furthermore, unless we manage to <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/07/virtualized-squashed-complexity-sausage.html">stop shifting the problems around</a>, the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/this-is-what-makes-networking-so-complex.html">networking as a whole won’t get simpler</a>.</p>
<p>What overlay network virtualization does bring us is a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/12/decouple-virtual-networking-from.html">decoupling</a> that makes <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/07/smart-fabrics-versus-overlay-virtual.html">physical infrastructure less complex</a> so it can focus on packet forwarding instead of zillions of customer-specific features preferably baked in custom ASICs. Obviously that’s not a good thing for everyone out there.</p>
<p>It could also be that the <a href="http://www.insiemenetworks.com/">company Joe is currently working</a> for has some truly revolutionary ideas (or so their web page claims), and I would love to be proven wrong, but the <a href="http://www.networkcomputing.com/data-center/cisco-insieme-itll-do-stuff-but-we-wont/240157351">first glimpses weren’t exactly encouraging</a>.</p>
