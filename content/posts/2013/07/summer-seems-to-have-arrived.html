<p>The current weather around Central Europe doesn’t exactly support this conclusion, but I do get many more “I’m on vacation” responses than usual, so it’s time to reduce the blogging frequency to keep your RSS reader from overloading (you did switch from Google Reader to something like <a href="http://www.feedly.com/">Feedly</a>, didn’t you?).</p>
<p>However, if you’re looking for some really heavy reading, do pick up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307278123?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0307278123&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=cisioshinandt-20">The Hidden Reality</a> and explore various multiverse proposals. There’s also a beach-friendly version of multiverse discussion: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062068687?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0062068687&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=cisioshinandt-20">The Long Earth</a> by the one-and-only Terry Pratchett.</p>
