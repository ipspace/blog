<p>Continuing from the previous <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2013/06/the-tools-that-i-use-webinars.html"><em>Tools That I Use</em></a> post, here’s what I’m using to generate the hand drawings in blog posts and case studies.<!--more--></p>
<p><a href="http://www.wacom.eu/index2.asp?pid=7005&amp;spid=4&amp;lang=en">Wacom Cintiq 12WX</a> with SketchBook Pro is indispensable for high-resolution drawings I’m using in case studies. I’ve tried to import router symbols in SketchBook Pro and make them look like they would be hand-drawn, but my illustrating skills are almost non-existent.</p>

<p>SketchBook Pro is an overkill for low-resolution blog post drawings … and it forces me to sit down with my computer, so I prefer to draw all other diagrams on an iPad. My fingers are way too clumsy and fat (supposedly rock climbing really helps to make them oversized), so I’m relying on a <a href="http://www.wacom.com/en/products/stylus/bamboo-stylus">Bamboo stylus</a> to get some reasonable precision.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fiftythree.com">Paper 53</a> is my favorite drawing program, particularly due to its interesting brush-resembling strokes.</p>

<p>Penultimate is not bad either, but is pretty limited in its drawing options. SketchBook for iPad is nice when I need to zoom in (to write small text) or work with multiple layers, but I’d need a newer iPad to get the most out of it.</p>

<p>Getting the drawings from the iPad to the laptop where I do all my writing has been a royal pain (the best I could do was sending them via email). Fortunately at least SketchBook Pro and Penultimate started supporting saving individual PNGs directly to Dropbox … where they miraculously appear on my laptop ready to be published in a blog post.</p>
