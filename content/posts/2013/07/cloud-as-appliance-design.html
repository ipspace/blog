title: Cloud-as-an-Appliance Design

<p>The original idea behind cloud-as-an-appliance design came from Brad Hedlund’s blog post in which he described how he’d <a href="http://bradhedlund.com/2012/08/27/the-appliance-approach-to-big-data-and-private-cloud/">build a greenfield Hadoop or private cloud cluster with servers connected to a Clos fabric</a>. Throw virtual appliances into the mix and you get an extremely simple and versatile architecture:<!--more--></p>

<p>Here are the basic design principles:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Build a leaf-and-spine fabric;</li>
<li>Connect servers to the leaf switches;</li>
<li>Dedicate a small cluster of servers to virtual appliances (firewalls and load balancers);</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously I handwaved over numerous details, including server and access link sizing, redundant server connectivity, separation (or not) between network and storage fabrics and oversubscription ratios … but you get the basic idea. Let’s focus on the really interesting part.</p>
<h4>External connectivity</h4><p>In the above design I’ve inserted a dedicated appliances cluster between the leaf-and-spine fabric and the network core. A dedicated cluster solves several interesting problems:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><strong>It removes most of the security audit concerns.</strong> It’s debatable how safe it is to run virtual appliances (especially firewalls) on the same physical hosts as user VMs, but if the virtual firewalls are the only workload running on a particular physical host, it’s hard to argue how that would be any less secure than the same firewall software running on a reassuringly expensive hardware appliance.</li>
<li><strong>It provides almost perfect isolation.</strong> Add external-facing NICs in the hosts running the virtual appliances, connect those NICs to the network core, and you have a design that’s identical to the traditional firewall-based design (the only exception being the hardware used to run the firewalling software).</li>
<li><strong>Virtual appliances have different resource needs</strong> than regular VMs. Regular VMs usually have (relatively) high memory requirements, and lower CPU/network requirements. Virtual appliances don’t use much memory, but need plenty of I/O bandwidth and CPU cores. The servers in the appliance cluster should thus be dimensioned differently than the other servers in the private cloud you’re building.</li>
<li><strong>Appliance cluster could use a different virtualization technology.</strong> Some appliance vendors started supporting Linux containers (Riverbed) that significantly minimize the per-appliance memory footprint, or dedicated software running on generic x86 hardware (Linerate Systems, now F5). Some open-source cloud orchestration platforms (ex: <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/CLOUDSTACK/lxc-support-in-cloudstack.html">CloudStack</a>) support Linux containers, allowing you to build a system with an optimal mix of virtualization platforms. </li>
</ul>
<p class="info">A dedicated appliance cluster connecting the private cloud infrastructure with the outside world makes most sense when you’re deploying complex applications that need firewall-based protection and external load balancing. If most of your workload consists of single-VM apps (what I called <a href="/2012/08/pvlan-vxlan-and-cloud-application.html">SMB LAMP stack</a>), you’d be better off using private VLANs on the leaf switches and L3 forwarding on the spine switches.</p>
