title: Overlay Virtual Networking Solutions Overview

<p>2013 was definitely the year of overlay virtual networks, with every major networking and virtualization vendor launching a new product or adding significant functionality to an existing one. Here’s a brief overview of what they’re currently offering:<!--more--></p>
<div class="separator"><a href="/2013/12/s1600-Overlay+Virtual+Networks+Overview.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="/2013/12/s520-Overlay+Virtual+Networks+Overview.png"/></a><br/>Slide taken from <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Cloud_Computing_Networking">Cloud Computing Networking</a> webinar</div>
<h4>Notes</h4><ul class="ListParagraph"><li>The table includes shipping products with publicly-available documentation (VMware NSX is an exception – they still don’t trust us to understand the documentation … but at least you can <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/NSXArch#Videos">watch the NSX architecture webinar</a>). </li>
<li>One can always implement a gateway between an overlay network and physical world with a multi-NIC VM. Those solutions aren’t listed in the <em>Gateways </em>column.</li>
<li>VMware NSX for multi-hypervisors has bare-metal L2 and L3 gateways, VMware NSX for vSphere has VM-based gateways with in-kernel L2 and L3 packet forwarding.</li>
<li>Hardware gateways for VMware NSX for multiple hypervisors (using OVSDB protocol) have been announced, but we haven’t seen a GA product yet.</li>
<li>Multiple vendors have announced hardware NVGRE gateways, no major vendor has shipped one.</li>
<li>Scalability of Hyper-V depends on the orchestration system. I couldn’t find maximum number of managed hosts supported by SC VMM 2012 – earlier versions support up to 400 hosts.</li>
<li>I couldn’t find the number of hosts or ports supported by a Contrail controller. Scale-out architecture using controller federation and BGP route reflectors is probably limited by the number of MP-BGP routes supported by the BGP route reflector (Contrail solution uses one VPNv4 host route per VM IP address).</li>
