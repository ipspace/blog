<p>After my <a href="http://www.menog.org/meetings/previous/menog-12/agenda/abstract/#clouds-overlays"><em>Clouds, Overlays and SDN: What really matters</em></a><em> </em>keynote presentation @ <a href="http://www.menog.org/meetings/previous/menog-12/">MENOG 12</a> a few attendees asked me for a recording; one of them said “<em>I want everyone in my organization to watch it</em><em>.</em>” Alas, wishes don’t always come true: the video team was <a href="/2013/04/the-many-paths-to-sdn/#c2984633890374835453">streaming the presentations, but not recording them</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately I had the same presentation @ PLNOG 11 and like always the PLNOG organizers did a marvelous job. The video has just been <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClKEkCRvWTQ">posted on YouTube</a>. Enjoy!</p>
