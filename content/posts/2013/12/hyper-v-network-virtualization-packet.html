<p><a href="/2012/12/hyper-v-network-virtualization-wnvnvgre.html">Initial release of Hyper-V Network Virtualization (HNV)</a> was an add-on to the <a href="/2013/05/hyper-v-30-extensible-virtual-switch.html">Hyper-V Extensible Switch</a>, resulting in an <a href="/2013/12/virtual-packet-forwarding-in-hyper-v.html">interesting mixture of bridging and routing</a>. In <a href="/2013/08/whats-coming-in-hyper-v-network.html">Windows Server 2012 R2 the two components became tightly integrated</a>, resulting in a pure layer-3 solution.<!--more--></p>
<p class="more">This blog post describes HNV packet forwarding in Windows Server 2012 R2. HNV behavior in Windows Server 2012 is <a href="/2013/12/virtual-packet-forwarding-in-hyper-v.html">described in another blog post</a>.</p>
<h4>HNV Architecture</h4><p>In Windows Server 2012 R2, Hyper-V Network Virtualization became an integral part of Hyper-V Extensible Switch. It intercepts all packets traversing the switch and thus behaves exactly like a virtual switch <a href="/2013/05/hyper-v-30-extensible-virtual-switch.html">forwarding extension</a> while still allowing another forwarding extension (Cisco Nexus 1000V or NEC PF1000) to work within the same virtual switch. </p>

<p>Hyper-V Network Virtualization module effectively transforms the Hyper-V layer-2 virtual switch into a pure layer-3 switch.</p>
<h4>Control plane setup</h4><p>A pure layer-3 switch could work without MAC reachability information (that’s how early versions of Amazon VPC behaved), but Microsoft decided to retain the semblance of layer-2 networks and IP subnets. The Hyper-V Network Virtualization forwarding module thus still requires IP routing table, ARP table, and remote VM reachability information (mapping of VM IP and MAC addresses into transport network IP addresses).</p>
<p>The PowerShell scripts used to configure the HNV haven’t changed. IP routing table is installed in the Hyper-V hosts with the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj884249.aspx"><strong>New-NetVirtualizationCustomerRoute</strong></a> PowerShell cmdlet. Mappings of VM IP and VM MAC addresses into transport IP addresses are created with the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj884243.aspx"><strong>New-NetVirtualizationLookupRecord</strong></a><strong> </strong>cmdlet.</p>
<h4>ARP processing</h4><p>Hyper-V Network Virtualization module is an ARP proxy: it replies to all broadcast ARP requests and multicast ND request <em>assuming it has the NetVirtualizationLookupRecord for the destination IP address</em>. </p>
<p>ARP requests for unknown IPv4 destinations and ND requests for unknown IPv6 destinations are flooded <em>if the virtual network contains layer-2-only NetVirtualizationLookupRecord entries</em> (used to implement <a href="/2013/08/whats-coming-in-hyper-v-network.html">dynamic IP addresses</a>).</p>
<p>Unicast ARP/ND requests are forwarded to the destination VM to support IPv6 Network Unreachability Detection (NUD) functionality.</p>
<h4>Packet forwarding</h4><p>Hyper-V Network Virtualization module intercepts all packets received by the Hyper-V extensible switch and drops all non-IP/ARP packets. ARP/ND packets are intercepted (see above), and the forwarding of IP datagrams relies solely on the destination IP address:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Routing table lookup is performed to find the next-hop customer IP address. Every HNV module has full routing table of the tenant virtual network – next-hop customer IP address is the destination IP address for all destinations within the virtual network;  </li>
<li>A lookup in <em>NetVirtualizationLookupRecord</em><em> </em>table transforms next-hop customer IP address into transport IP address;</li>
<li>Destination MAC address in the forwarded packet is rewritten using the value from the <em>NetVirtualizationLookupRecord</em> (implementing destination MAC rewrite on inter-subnet forwarding).</li>
</ul>
<p>When the destination transport IP address equals the local IP address (destination customer IP address resides within the local host), HNV sends the packet back to the Hyper-V Extensible Switch, which delivers the packet to the destination VM.</p>
<p>Extra lookup steps within the transport network are performed for non-local destinations:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Routing table lookup in the global IP routing table transforms transport destination IP address into transport next-hop IP address;</li>
<li>ARP/ND table lookup transforms transport next-hop IP address into transport MAC address.</li>
</ul>
<p class="info">HNV has full support and feature parity for IPv4 and IPv6. Whenever this blog post mentions IP, the behavior described applies equally well to IPv4 and IPv6.</p>
<p>Multicast and broadcast IP traffic is flooded. Flooding mechanism uses IP multicast in the transport network if there’s a <em>NetVirtualizationLookupRecord </em>mapping destination multicast/broadcast customer IP address into a transport multicast IP address, and source node packet replication in all other cases.</p>
