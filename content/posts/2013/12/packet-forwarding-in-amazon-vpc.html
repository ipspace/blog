title: Packet Forwarding in Amazon VPC
url: /2013/12/packet-forwarding-in-amazon-vpc.html
---

<p>Packet forwarding behavior of <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/11/layer-2-and-layer-3-switching-in-vmware.html">VMware NSX</a> and <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/12/hyper-v-network-virtualization-packet.html">Hyper-V Network Virtualization</a> is well documented; no such documentation exists for Amazon VPC. However, even though Amazon uses a proprietary solution (heavily modified Xen hypervisor with homemade virtual switch), it’s pretty easy to figure out the basics from the observed network behavior and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/vpc/">extensive user documentation</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p><a href="http://cloudierthanthou.wordpress.com/">Chiradeep Vittal</a> ran a number of tests between virtual machines in an Amazon VPC network and <a href="http://cloudierthanthou.wordpress.com/2013/04/30/the-sdn-behemoth-hiding-in-plain-sight/">shared the results in a blog post</a> and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/10/ttl-in-overlay-virtual-networks.html?showComment=1384222680616#c3693458316860412226">extensive comments on one of my posts</a>. Here’s a short summary:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Virtual switches in Amazon VPC perform layer-3-only unicast IPv4 forwarding (similar to recent Hyper-V Network Virtualization behavior). All non-IPv4 traffic and multicast/broadcast IPv4 traffic is dropped.</li>
<li>Layer-3 forwarding in the hypervisor virtual switch does not decrement TTL – it’s like all virtual machines reside in the same subnet;</li>
<li>Hypervisor proxies all ARP requests and replies with the expected MAC addresses of target VMs or first-hop gateway (early implementations of Amazon VPC used the same destination MAC address in all ARP replies);</li>
<li>Virtual switch implements limited router-like functionality. For example, the default gateway IP address replies to pings, but a VM cannot ping the default gateway of another subnet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like a run-of-the-mill virtual networking implementation, but wait – that’s not all. The beauty of Amazon VPC forwarding model is the multi-VRF approach: you can create multiple routing tables in your VPC and assign one of them to each subnet. </p>

<p>You could, for example, use the default route toward the Internet for <em>web server </em>subnet, default route toward your data center for <em>database server </em>subnet, and no default routing (local connectivity only) for your <em>application server </em>subnet. Pretty cool stuff if you’re an MPLS/VPN geek used to schizophrenic routing tables, and quite a tough nut to crack for people who want to migrate their existing layer-2 networks into the cloud. Massimo Re Ferre made a perfect summary: <a href="http://it20.info/2013/12/virtualization-vs-abstraction-in-cloud-networking/">everyone else is virtualizing the network, Amazon VPC is abstracting it</a>.</p>
