<p>As you know, I’m <a href="/2012/12/webinars-in-2012.html">promising my subscribers 4-6 new sessions a year</a>. 2013 definitely wasn’t a bad year in that respect ;)</p>
<p>The year started with <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_Transition_Mechanisms">IPv6 Transition Mechanisms</a>, and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Virtual_Firewalls">virtual firewalls</a>.</p>
<p>There was a <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Load_Balancing_and_Scale-Out_Application_Architectures">deep dive into scale-out architectures and load balancing</a> in April, and the mandatory <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics">Data Center Fabrics Update</a> session in May.<!--more--></p>
<p>In June, Tore Anderson joined me for a free <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6-Only_Data_Centers">IPv6-only Data Centers</a> webinar.</p>
<p>Autumn webinars were focused on virtual networks, starting with a brand-new <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Overlay_Virtual_Networking">Overlay Virtual Networking</a>, an update session of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Virtualized_Networking">Introduction to Virtualized Networking</a>, and concluding with a totally redesigned <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Cloud_Computing_Networking">Cloud Computing Networking</a> webinar.   </p>
<p>Sponsored webinars really took off in 2013, starting with <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/ProgrammableFlow_Technical_Deep_Dive">ProgrammableFlow Deep Dive</a>. I described <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Enterasys_Robust_Data_Center_Interconnect_Solutions">creative routing Enterasys uses in their fabric solutions</a> in June, and dived deep into the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/VMware_NSX_Architecture">VMware NSX architecture</a> with Brad Hedlund in September. </p>
<p>NEC was definitely the sponsor-of-the year. They not only sponsored two webinars (and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SDN,_NFV_and_OpenFlow_for_Skeptics">another one in January 2013</a>), they decided to focus on <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Real_Life_OpenFlow-based_SDN_Use_Cases">technology webinars that will benefit the whole SDN community</a>, not just the users of their products. Thank you!</p>
<p>Finally, a huge thank you to my students – your trust in my webinars, your <a href="http://cms.ipspace.net/bin/surveyResults?year=2013">positive feedback</a>, the fantastic questions you ask during the live sessions, and your kind emails keep me going. All the best in 2014!</p>
