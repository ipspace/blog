<p>12 months, 260 blog posts, and a dozen of webinars … and it’s time for another end-of-year post. It’s amazing how quickly a year goes by when you have fun. </p>
<p>I’d like to thank you for your insightful comments, great questions you asked, and wonderful challenges you keep sending me … and special thanks to all of you who trusted me enough to buy my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">webinars</a> or decided to <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/ExpertExpress">rely on my professional judgment</a>.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to shut down your pagers and smartphones (if at all possible), and enjoy the simpler (and less stressful) life with the loved ones. Have a great holiday season and all the best (including plenty of SDN fun) in the coming year!</p>
