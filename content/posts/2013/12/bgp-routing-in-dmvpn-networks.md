Once you decide to [use BGP as the routing protocol in your DMVPN network](http://www.ipspace.net/Integrating_Internet_VPN_with_MPLS_VPN_WAN), you face a few more design choices:

-   Should you use IBGP or EBGP?
-   Should you use a unique AS number for every DMVPN site, or the same AS number on all spoke sites?

The [*BGP Routing in DMVPN Access Networks*](http://www.ipspace.net/BGP_Routing_in_DMVPN_Access_Network) [ExpertExpress](http://www.ipspace.net/ExpertExpress) case study describes these dilemmas in more details.
