<p>There were numerous great presentations at last week’s <a href="http://www.menog.org/meetings/menog-12/agenda/">MENOG 12 meeting</a>. The best technical ones (from my perspective): <a href="http://www.menog.org/presentations/menog-12/132-AD_Traffic_Engineering.pptx">BGP Traffic Engineering</a> by Andy Davidson, <a href="http://www.menog.org/presentations/menog-12/125-Challenges_of_IPV6_for_a_WiMAX_Operator-MobinNet-Menog12-2013-3-6.pdf">problems WIMAX operators face in IPv6 world</a> by Reza Mahmoudi and Regional Threat Profile by Dave Monnier (Team Cymru).<!--more--></p>
<p>On a more business side, there was a <a href="http://www.menog.org/presentations/menog-12/126-Cowie_MENOG12.pdf">great connectivity presentation</a> from James Cowie (Renesys) and <a href="http://www.menog.org/presentations/menog-12/112-France-IX_-_feedback_from_a_young_IXP.pdf">hands-on guidelines for setting up a successful IXP</a> from Franck Simon.</p>
<p class="note">You can <a href="http://www.menog.org/meetings/menog-12/presentations/">download most of the presentations from MENOG 12 web site</a> and eventually we might enjoy them online.</p>
<p>The meeting organization was fantastic (but one would expect no less from a meeting where RIPE NCC is involved) and I even managed to find a <a href="http://www.dorellsports.com/climbing/dubai.html">Dubai attraction</a> that most tourists (and locals) remain totally unaware of ;)</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like to thank <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/dosary">Osama Al-Dosary</a> for inviting me to MENOG 12, the <a href="http://www.menog.org/meetings/menog-12/pc/">program committee</a> who did a great job selecting the presentations, and the organizing team for a wonderful experience.</p>
