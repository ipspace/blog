<p>You might not have to deploy IPv6 in your network tomorrow (if you’re an ISP I sincerely hope you do), but that’s no excuse for not getting prepared for the eventual inevitable deployment (Tom Hollingsworth has <a href="http://networkingnerd.net/2011/09/30/motivating-for-enterprise-ipv6-adoption/">way more to say on this topic</a>).</p>
<p class="warn">Don’t believe in the “inevitable” part? Maybe you should spend some time with people who were running SNA and IPX networks two decades ago and living in blissful IP denial.<!--more--></p>
<p>One of the mandatory steps of your getting-ready process should be visiting <a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/v6ops/">V6OPS IETF</a> working group and reading at least its RFCs and drafts, like the newly released <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6883"><em>IPv6 Guidance for Internet Content Providers</em></a><em> </em>(RFC 6883), which contains a nice summary of major steps and roadblocks a content provider (including all enterprise networks that operate their own web site) faces during the IPv6 deployment.</p>
