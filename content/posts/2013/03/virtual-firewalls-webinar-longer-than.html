title: Virtual Firewalls Webinar – Longer Than Expected

<p>When I started developing the virtual firewalls webinar, it looked like a simple project: define what a <em>virtual firewall</em> is and explain the architectural options (see the diagram).</p>

<p>Then I got a crazy idea: it would be nice to add a few sample products ... and the webinar material started to swell.<!--more--></p>
<p>The <strong>v</strong><strong>irtual appliances</strong><strong> </strong>section was easy: it describes a sample VM appliance (vShield Edge) and interesting scale-out architecture (Embrane Helios). There are numerous other VM-based firewall appliances out there, but I didn’t want to turn the webinar into a <a href="https://solutionexchange.vmware.com/store/category_groups/19">Virtual Appliance Marketplace</a> buyer’s guide.</p>
<p><strong>VM NIC firewalls</strong> section was the hardest one: it started as a description of vShield App and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/11/junipers-virtual-gateway-virtual.html">Juniper’s Virtual Gateway</a>, and then I decided to include products offering packet filters and added <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/06/what-exactly-is-nexus-1000v.html">Nexus 1000V</a>. </p>
<p>However, VMware is not the only hypervisor worth considering any more – virtual switch in <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/12/hyper-v-network-virtualization-wnvnvgre.html">Hyper-V 3.0</a> is fully extensible and Cisco, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/02/nec-programmableflow-principles-of.html">NEC</a> and 5nine already have security-related extensions-</p>
<p>Finally, there’s Linux and Open vSwitch – XenServer includes a simple OpenFlow controller, and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/07/vmware-buys-nicira-hypervisor-vendor.html">VMware/Nicira</a> NVP and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/08/midokuras-midonet-layer-2-4-virtual.html">Midokura MidoNet</a> have numerous security features including statefulish firewalls.</p>
<p>The <strong>service insertion </strong>section is still slim: there’s Cisco’s VSG and HP’s Tipping Point, and Cisco is the only company I’m aware of that does <strong>service chaining </strong>in a shipping product.</p>
