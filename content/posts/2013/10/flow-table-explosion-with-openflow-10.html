title: Flow Table Explosion with OpenFlow 1.0 (And Why We Need OpenFlow 1.3)
url: /2013/10/flow-table-explosion-with-openflow-10/

<p>The number of flows in hardware switches (dictated by the underlying TCAM size) is one of the major roadblocks in a large-scale OpenFlow deployment. Vendors are supposedly making progress, with Intel claiming up to <a href="https://communities.intel.com/community/wired/blog/2012/09/18/taking-the-wraps-off-of-intel-s-new-sdn-products-at-idf">4000 12-tuple flow entries in their new Ethernet Switch FM6700 series</a>. Is that good enough? As always, it depends.</p>
<p><strong>TL&amp;DR summary</strong>: Use switches that support OpenFlow 1.3.<!--more--></p>
<p>First, let’s put the “4000 flows” number in perspective. It’s definitely a bit better than what current commodity switches can do (for vendors trying to keep mum about their OpenFlow limitations, check their ACL sizes – flow entries would use the same TCAM), but NEC had <a href="http://www.necam.com/docs/?id=5ce9b8d9-e3f3-41de-a5c2-6bd7c9b37246">64.000+ flows on the PF5240</a> years ago and <a href="http://www.enterasys.com/company/literature/coreflow2-tsb.pdf">Enterasys has 64 million flows per box with their CoreFlow2 technology</a>. Judge for yourself whether 4000 flows is such a major step forward.</p>
<p>Now let’s focus on whether 4000 flows is enough. As always, the answer depends on the use case, network size and implementation details. This blog post will focus on the last part.</p>
<h4>Use case: Data Center Fabric</h4><p>The simplest possible data center use case is a traditional (non-virtualized) data center network implemented with OpenFlow (similar to what NEC is doing with their Virtual Tenant Networks). </p>
<p>The OpenFlow-based network trying to get feature parity with low-cost traditional ToR switches should support</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Layer-2 and layer-3 forwarding;</li>
<li>Per-port or per-MAC ingress and egress access lists.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll focus on a single layer-2 segment (you really don’t want to get me started on the complexities of scalable OpenFlow-based layer-3 forwarding) implemented on a single hardware switch (expanding the logic beyond that is a homework assignment). Our segment will have two web servers (port 1 and 2), a MySQL server (port 3), and a default gateway on port 4. </p>
<p class="note">The default gateway could be a firewall, a router, or a load balancer – it really doesn’t matter if we stay focused on layer-2 forwarding.</p>
<h4>Step 1: Simple MAC-based forwarding</h4><p>The OpenFlow controller has to install a few forwarding rules in the switch to get the traffic started. Ignoring the multi-tenancy requirements you need a single flow forwarding rule per destination MAC address:</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="codeTable"><tr class="TRFirst"><td class="TDHead" valign="top"><p>Flow match</p>
</td><td class="TDHead" valign="top"><p>Action</p>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>DMAC = Web-1</p>
</td><td valign="top"><p>Forward to port 1</p>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>DMAC = Web-2</p>
</td><td valign="top"><p>Forward to port 2</p>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>DMAC = MYSQL-1</p>
</td><td valign="top"><p>Forward to port 3</p>
</td></tr><tr class="TRLast"><td class="TDLast" valign="top"><p>DMAC = GW</p>
</td><td class="TDLast" valign="top"><p>Forward to port 4</p>
</td></tr></table><p>Number of flows needed = number of MAC addresses.</p>
<p class="note">Smart switches wouldn’t store the MAC-only flow rules in TCAM; they would use other forwarding structures available in the switch like MAC hash tables.</p>
<h4>Step 2: Multi-Tenant Infrastructure</h4><p>If you want to implement multi-tenancy, you need multiple forwarding tables (like VRFs), which are not available in OpenFlow 1.0, or you have to add the tenant ID to the existing forwarding table. Traditional switches would do it in two steps:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Mark inbound packets with VLAN tags;</li>
<li>Perform packet forwarding based on destination MAC address and VLAN tag.</li>
</ul>
<p>Switches using OpenFlow 1.0 forwarding model cannot perform more than one operation during the packet forwarding process – they must match the input port and destination MAC address in a single flow rule, resulting in a flow table similar to this one:</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="codeTable"><tr class="TRFirst"><td class="TDHead" valign="top"><p>Flow match</p>
</td><td class="TDHead" valign="top"><p>Action</p>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>SrcPort = Port 2, DMAC = Web-1</p>
</td><td valign="top"><p>Forward to port 1</p>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>SrcPort = Port 3, DMAC = Web-1</p>
</td><td valign="top"><p>Forward to port 1</p>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>SrcPort = Port 4, DMAC = Web-1</p>
</td><td valign="top"><p>Forward to port 1</p>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>SrcPort = Port 1, DMAC = Web-2</p>
</td><td valign="top"><p>Forward to port 2</p>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>SrcPort = Port 3, DMAC = Web-2</p>
</td><td valign="top"><p>Forward to port 2</p>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>SrcPort = Port 4, DMAC = Web-2</p>
</td><td valign="top"><p>Forward to port 2</p>
</td></tr><tr class="TRLast"><td class="TDLast" colspan="2" valign="top"><p>…</p>
</td></tr></table><p>Number of flows needed = sum of (number of tenant MAC addresses * number of tenant ports). The proof is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<h4>Step 3: Access lists</h4><p>Let’s assume we want to protect the web servers with an input (server-to-switch) port ACL, which would look similar to this one:</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="codeTable"><tr class="TRFirst"><td class="TDHead" valign="top"><p>Match</p>
</td><td class="TDHead" valign="top"><p>Action</p>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>TCP SRC = 80</p>
</td><td valign="top"><p>Permit</p>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>TCP SRC = 443</p>
</td><td valign="top"><p>Permit</p>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>TCP DST = 53 &amp; IP DST = <em>DNS</em></p>
</td><td valign="top"><p>Permit</p>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>TCP DST = 25 &amp; IP DST = <em>Mail</em></p>
</td><td valign="top"><p>Permit</p>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>TCP DST = 3306 &amp; IP DST = <em>MySql</em></p>
</td><td valign="top"><p>Permit</p>
</td></tr><tr class="TRLast"><td class="TDLast" valign="top"><p>Anything else</p>
</td><td class="TDLast" valign="top"><p>Drop</p>
</td></tr></table><p>By now you’ve probably realized what happens when you try to combine the input ACL with other forwarding rules. The OpenFlow controller has to generate a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product"><em>Cartesian product</em></a><em> </em>of all three requirements: the switch needs a flow entry for every possible combination of input port, ACL entry and destination MAC address.</p>
<p>Number of flows needed = sum of (number of tenant MAC addresses * number of tenant ports * number of ACL entries)</p>
<p>Plug in realistic numbers and do the math.</p>
<h4>OpenFlow 1.3 to the rescue</h4><p>Is the situation really as hopeless as illustrated above? Of course not – smart people trying to implement real-life OpenFlow solutions quickly realized bare-bones OpenFlow 1.0 works well only in PPT, lab tests, PoCs and glitzy demos, and started working on a solution. </p>
<p>OpenFlow 1.1 (and later versions) have a concept of <em>tables </em>- independent lookup tables that can be chained in any way you wish (further complicating the life of hardware vendors).</p>
<p>This is how you could implement our requirements with switches supporting OpenFlow 1.3:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Table #1 – ACL and tenant classification table. This table would match input ports (for tenant classification) and ACL entries, drop the packets not matched by input ACLs, and redirect the forwarding logic to correct per-tenant table. </li>
<li>Table #2 .. #n – per-tenant forwarding tables, matching destination MAC addresses and specifying output ports.</li>
</ul>
<p class="info">The first table could be further optimized in networks using the same (overly long) access list on numerous ports. That decision could also be made dynamically by the OpenFlow controller.</p>
<p>A typical switch would probably have to implement the first table with a TCAM. All the other tables could use the regular MAC forwarding logic (MAC forwarding table is usually orders of magnitude bigger than TCAM). Scalability problem solved.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Buy switches and controllers that support OpenFlow 1.3</p>
<h4>But there are no OpenFlow 1.3-compliant switches on the market</h4><p>Not true anymore. NEC is shipping OpenFlow 1.3 on their ProgrammableFlow switches, and <a href="http://h17007.www1.hp.com/docs/interop/2013/37958_HPN_SDN_Openflow_Brief_042913_lo.pdf">HP claims the 5900 series switches have OpenFlow 1.3</a> although <a href="http://h17007.www1.hp.com/au/en/solutions/technology/openflow/index.aspx">their own web site doesn’t support those claims</a> (would it be too much to expect HP marketing to use the same present tense grammar rules as their documentation department?).</p>
<h4>Can we still use OpenFlow 1.0 switches?</h4><p>Of course you can (but be careful). </p>
<p>Either make sure the use case is small enough so the Cartesian product of your independent requirements fits into existing TCAM, or figure out which vendors have table-like extensions to OpenFlow 1.0 (hint: NEC does, or their VTN wouldn’t work in real-life networks).</p>
