<p>An odd idea stroke me when watching the <a href="http://www.spirent.com/Products/Avalanche/Avalanche_Latest_Release">Avalanche NEXT</a> presentation during <a href="http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd6/">Networking Tech Field Day</a> – they have a fuzzing module that you can use to test whether your servers and applications survive all sorts of crazy illegal requests. Could that be used to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities in your web apps?<!--more--></p>
<p>It seems the answer is YES (at least <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiR9y85GAlA&amp;list=PLObjX_zORJMCT_E1iKhvw1FzSr2hQnaY-&amp;index=2">based on the answers they gave during the presentation</a>), but it would be nice to have a more definitive one. Comments most welcome.</p>
<p>If nothing else, if you happen to have their appliance, it’s definitely a good idea to add the fuzzing stress test into your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing#User_acceptance_testing">UAT</a> test suite – it just might catch all those cases where server-side developers got sloppy because they expected that the JavaScript code in web browser performs input validation (an idea that makes everyone remotely familiar with how web works cringe in horror). </p>
