title: Extending Layer-2 Connection into a Cloud

<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/carlos-asensio-ruiz/10/85b/bb5">Carlos Asensio</a> was facing an “interesting” challenge: someone has sold a layer-2 extension into their public cloud to one of the customers. Being a good engineer, he wanted to limit the damage the customer could do to the cloud infrastructure and thus immediately rejected the idea to connect the customer straight into the layer-2 network core ... but what could he do?<!--more--></p>
<p>Overlay virtual networks just might be a solution if you have to solve a similar problem:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Build the cloud portion of the customer’s layer-2 network with an overlay virtual networking technology;</li>
<li>Install an extra NIC in one (or more) physical host and run a VXLAN-to-VLAN gateway in a VM on that host – the customer’s VLAN is thus completely isolated from the data center network core;</li>
<li>Connect the extra NIC to WAN edge router or switch on which the customer’s link is terminated. Whatever stupidity the customer does in its part of the stretched layer-2 network won’t spill further than the gateway VM and the overlay network (and you could easily limit the damage by reducing the CPU cycles available to the gateway VM).</li>
</ul>
<p>The diversity of overlay virtual networking solutions available today gives you plenty of choices:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>You could use <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/06/what-exactly-is-nexus-1000v.html">Nexus 1000V</a> with <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/08/finally-mac-over-ip-based-vcloud.html">VXLAN</a> or OVS/GRE/OpenStack combo at no additional cost (combining VLANs with GRE-encapsulated subnets might be an interesting challenge in current OpenStack Quantum release);</li>
<li>VMware’s version of VXLAN comes with vCNS (a product formerly known as vShield), so you’ll need a vCNS license;</li>
<li>You could also use <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/08/what-is-vmware-nsx.html">VMware NSX</a> (aka Nicira NVP) with a layer-2 gateway (included in NSX).</li>
</ul>
<p class="note"><a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/12/hyper-v-network-virtualization-wnvnvgre.html">Hyper-V Network Virtualization</a> might have a problem dealing with dynamic MAC addresses coming from the customer’s data center – this is one of the rare use cases where <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/12/vxlan-ip-multicast-openflow-and-control.html">dynamic MAC learning</a> works better than a proper control plane.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/10/vxlan-termination-on-physical-devices.html">VXLAN-to-VLAN gateway</a> linking the cloud portion of the customer’s network with the customer’s VLAN could be implemented with <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus1000/sw/4_2_1_s_v_2_2_1/VXLAN/b_VXLAN_Configuration_4_2_1SV_2_2_1_chapter_011.pdf">Cisco’s VXLAN gateway</a> or a simple Linux or Windows VM on which you bridge the overlay and VLAN interfaces (yet again, one of those rare cases where VM-based bridging makes sense). Arista’s 7150 or F5 BIG-IP is probably an overkill.</p>
<p>And now for a bit of totally unrelated trivia: once we solved the interesting part of the problem, I asked about the details of the customer interconnect link – they planned to have a single 100 Mbps link and thus a single path of failure. I can only wish them luck and hope they’ll try to <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/06/stretched-clusters-almost-as-good-as.html">run stretched clusters over that link</a>.</p>
