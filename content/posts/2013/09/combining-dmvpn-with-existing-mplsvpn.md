One of the [Expert Express](http://www.ipspace.net/ExpertExpress) sessions focused on an MPLS/VPN-based WAN network using OSPF as the routing protocol. The customer wanted to add DMVPN-based backup links and planned to retain OSPF as the routing protocol. Not surprisingly, the initial design had all sorts of unexpectedly complex kludges (see the [case study](http://www.ipspace.net/Integrating_Internet_VPN_with_MPLS_VPN_WAN) for more details).

Having a really smart engineer on the other end of the WebEx call, I had to ask a single question: "Why don't you use BGP everywhere" and after a short pause got back the expected reply "wow... now it all makes sense."
