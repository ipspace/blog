<p>I spent most of the last week in day-long geek parties better known as <a href="http://techfieldday.com/nfd/">Networking Tech Field Day</a>. Talking with <a href="http://www.thousandeyes.com">startups doing cool things</a> or <a href="http://www.spirent.com/About-Us/News_Room/Press-Releases/2013/09_10_13_Spirent_Unveils_Spirent_Avalanche_NEXT">vendors launching cool products</a>, and bouncing barely-feasible ideas off fellow geeks is intoxicating. No wonder I was <a href="/2011/10/i-apologize-but-im-excited/">so excited after the previous events</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>Eventually I’ll wake up in the <a href="http://it20.info/2012/09/cloud-and-the-three-it-geographies-silicon-valley-us-and-rest-of-the-world/">harsh reality of three geographies</a>, settle in my cozy corner in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">trough of the disillusionment</a> and become my grumpy old self. In the meantime, you might find my blog posts to be a bit rainbow colored, glitzy from the pixie dust … and if you look hard enough, you might spot a unicorn hiding just around the corner.</p>
<p>Finally, good things don’t just happen – <a href="http://techfieldday.com/delegate/stephen-foskett/">Stephen Foskett</a>, the mastermind behind the Tech Field Days, and his crew (<a href="http://techfieldday.com/delegate/claire-chaplais/">Claire Chaplais</a> and unforgettable Tom <a href="http://networkingnerd.net">The Nerd</a> Hollingsworth) pulled off yet another fantastic event. Perfect organization, no Gartner, just a pinch of marketing, and loads of presenters <a href="https://twitter.com/BobMcCouch/status/378940141186076672">who really knew their stuff</a>. Great job! Thank you!</p>
