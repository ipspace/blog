<p><a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2010/09/vmotion-elephant-in-data-center-room.html">Moving a running VM</a> into a foreign subnet is <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/07/live-vm-mobility-network-requirements.html">Mission Impossible due to stale ARP entries</a> (anyone telling you otherwise is handwaving over a detail or two - maybe their VM doesn't communicate with other VMs in the same subnet), but it's entirely feasible to migrate a cold VM into a foreign subnet <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/08/enterasys-host-routing-optimal-l3.html">if you can fix IP routing</a>. Here's <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/3.3%20-%20Cold%20VM%20Migration%20over%20L3%20DCI.mp4">how you can do the trick with Enterasys switches</a>.</p>
