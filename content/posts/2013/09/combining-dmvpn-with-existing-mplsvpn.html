title: Combining DMVPN with Existing MPLS/VPN Network

<p>One of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/ExpertExpress">Expert Express</a> sessions focused on an MPLS/VPN-based WAN network using OSPF as the routing protocol. The customer wanted to add DMVPN-based backup links and planned to retain OSPF as the routing protocol. Not surprisingly, the initial design had all sorts of unexpectedly complex kludges (see the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Integrating_Internet_VPN_with_MPLS_VPN_WAN">case study</a> for more details). </p>
<p>Having a really smart engineer on the other end of the WebEx call, I had to ask a single question: “Why don’t you use BGP everywhere” and after a short pause got back the expected reply “wow ... now it all makes sense.”</p>
