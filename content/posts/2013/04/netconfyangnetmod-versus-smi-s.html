<p>With all the Puppet buzz I’m hearing and claims that “<em>compute and storage orchestration problems have been solved</em>” I wanted to check the reality of those claims – is it (for example) possible to create a LUN on a storage array using a standard well-defined API.</p>
<p>Stephen Foskett, Simon Gordon and Scott Lowe quickly pointed me in the right direction: SMI-S. Thank you!<!--more--></p>
<h4>Reality based on public information</h4><p>You know I had to check whether SMI-S really delivers on its promises. It does; just check all the things you can do on <a href="http://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/SMI-Sv1.6r4-Block.book_.pdf">block devices</a> (and there’s <a href="http://www.snia.org/tech_activities/standards/curr_standards/smi">plenty more</a>). One must wonder how the storage industry got its act together and actually created a full management framework while the networking industry doesn’t even have a standard mechanism to assign an IP address to a router interface (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-netmod-ip-cfg">draft-ietf-netmod-ip-cfg</a> is still a draft). It looks like the networking experts working in IETF working groups love to reinvent heptagonal wheels.</p>
<p>SMI-S is based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Information_Model_(computing)">CIM</a>. All it does is define the CIM objects used to manage storage entities. Problem solved.</p>
<p>IETF has (so far) created two working groups to solve the device configuration problem:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/netconf/">NETCONF</a> group, which had to invent an XML-based protocol and a novel way of transmitting XML documents over an SSH session (which took <a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-netconf-ssh/history/">three years</a>), because HTTP (that everyone else is using) just wouldn’t be good enough.</li>
<li><a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/netmod/charter/">NETMOD</a> group which had to invent a new data modeling language (YANG), and only then focus on what we really need – configuration data models that describe data structures one has to send to a device to get the job done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not surprisingly, SMI-S got from rough ideas to interoperability testing in three years (2000-2003) and became ANSI standard a year later (2004).</p>
<p>NETCONF working group started in 2003 and produced the first standards (NETCONF and NETCONF over SSH) in late 2006. </p>
<p>NETMOD working group started in 2008. I don’t want to believe nobody realized we actually need <em>common data models</em> to configure devices from multiple vendors ... but then maybe with <a href="/2012/06/netconf-expect-on-steroids/">NETCONF being a more reliable version of Expect</a> the people who already implemented their own layer of abstraction in their home-brewed multi-vendor provisioning scripts got what they needed (reliable transport), so they stopped caring.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it took 2 years to develop YANG (in 2010) ... and only then NETMOD group started working on actual data models. A decade after NETCONF started, we don’t have a single usable RFC that two vendors could take to implement a common way to configure something as simple as an IP address and a mask on an interface.</p>
<h4>Experience-Based Reality?</h4><p>It’s perfectly possible that I got it all wrong, and that nobody uses SMI-S. VMware sure doesn’t; on the other hand <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/san/archive/2012/06/26/an-introduction-to-storage-management-in-windows-server-2012.aspx">SMI-S is part of Windows Storage Management API in Windows Server 2012</a>. It could also be that CMI is way too complex for real life (so NETCONF+YANG actually makes more sense), although <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa389234(v=vs.85).aspx">Microsoft seems to be pretty happy using it for its management APIs</a>. Any pointer to real-life experience with SMI-S is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>As for lengthy IETF standardization process, it’s no wonder initiatives like Open Networking Foundation want to initiate their own standard development process.</p>
