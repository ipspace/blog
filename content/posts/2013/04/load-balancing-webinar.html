title: Load Balancing Webinar

<p>My newest webinar (<a href="http://loadbalancing.eventbrite.com/">scheduled for end of April</a>) focuses on <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Load_Balancing_and_Scale-Out_Application_Architectures">scale-out application architectures and load balancing in data centers</a>. We’ll start with application-based load balancing (you can solve most of the scale-out challenges with proper application design), and conclude with a detailed description of numerous network-based load balancing mechanisms (from local and global anycast to DNS-based load balancing and dedicated load balancers ... oops, application delivery controllers).</p>
<p>The webinar is an update session for the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_3.0_for_Networking_Engineers">Data Center 3.0 webinar</a> and so everyone who has ever attended DC 3.0 webinar or bought its recording gets a free seat on the load balancing webinar; you’ll find the details once you log into the webinar management system.</p>
