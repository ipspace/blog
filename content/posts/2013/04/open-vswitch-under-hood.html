<p>Hatem Naguib claimed that “<em>t</em><em>he NSX controller cluster is completely out-of-band, and never handles a data packet</em>” when describing VMware NSX Network Virtualization architecture, preemptively avoiding the “<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/01/fib-update-challenges-in-openflow.html">flow-based forwarding doesn’t scale</a>” arguments usually triggered by <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/10/openflow-and-state-explosion.html">stupidities like this one</a>. </p>
<p>Does that mean there’s no <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/02/process-fast-and-cef-switching-and.html">packet punting</a> in the NSX/Open vSwitch world? Not so fast.<!--more--></p>
<p>First, to set the record straight, NVP OpenFlow controller (NSX controller cluster) <em>does not</em> touch actual packets. There’s no <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/03/controller-based-packet-forwarding-in.html">switch-to-controller punting</a>; NVP has enough topology information to proactively download OpenFlow flow entries to Open vSwitch (OVS).</p>
<p>However, Open vSwitch has two components: the <a href="http://openvswitch.org/cgi-bin/ovsman.cgi?page=vswitchd%2Fovs-vswitchd.8">user-mode daemon</a> (process switching in Cisco IOS terms) and the kernel forwarding module, which <a href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/networking/openvswitch.txt?id=HEAD">implements per-flow forwarding and corresponding actions</a>, not the full complement of OpenFlow matching rules. </p>
<p class="note">There's a third component present in every OVS environment: the ovsdb (OVS database) daemon, but it's not relevant to this discussion, so we'll conveniently ignore it.</p>
<p>Whenever the first packet of a new flow passes through the Open vSwitch kernel module, it’s sent to the Open vSwitch daemon, which evaluates the OpenFlow rules downloaded from the OpenFlow controller, accepts or drops the packet, and installs the corresponding per-flow forwarding rule into the kernel module. </p>
<p>Does this sound similar to <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/multilayer-switching-switching-at-the-speed-of-wire/5033818">Multi-Layer Switching</a> or the way <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/10/cisco-virtual-security-gateway-vsg-101.html">Cisco’s VSG and Nexus 1000V VEM work</a>? It’s exactly the same concept, implemented in kernel/user space of a single hypervisor host. There really is nothing new under the sun.</p>
<p class="more">I would strongly recommend you read the well written <a href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/networking/openvswitch.txt?id=HEAD">developer documentation</a> if you want to know the dirty details.</p>
<p>This approach keeps the kernel module simple and tidy, and allows the Open vSwitch architecture to support other flow programming paradigms, not just OpenFlow – you can use OVS as a simple learning bridge supporting VLANs, sFlow and NetFlow (not hard once you’ve implemented per-flow forwarding), or you could implement your own forwarding paradigm while leveraging the stability of Open vSwitch kernel module that’s <a href="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-3-Part-1-Networking-1421959.html">included with version 3.3 of the Linux kernel</a> and already made its way into <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/Open_vSwitch">standard Linux distributions</a>.</p>
<p>Just to give you an example: Midokura chose to use the Open vSwitch kernel module in combination with their user-mode daemon in the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/08/midokuras-midonet-layer-2-4-virtual.html">MidoNet product</a> – you can install MidoNet on recent Linux distributions without touching the kernel. Smart move ;)</p>
<p class="update">2013-08-09: Changed the description of ovs-vswitchd. According to the <a href="http://git.openvswitch.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=openvswitch;a=blob_plain;f=README;hb=HEAD">recent list of OVS features</a> the only control-plane protocol it runs is LACP.</p>
