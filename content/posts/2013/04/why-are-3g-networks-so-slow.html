title: Why are 3G networks so slow?

<p>More than four years ago one of my friends wrote about uselessness of UMTS connections (the page has decayed into digital wasteland in the meantime) for inter-router backup links and although I <a href="/2010/01/weird-gprs-and-umts-latency/">got numerous comments trying to explain the issues</a> I never found a good explanation that a simplistic networking engineer like me could understand.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/igrigorik">Ilya Grigorik</a> fixed that. His <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il4swGfTOSM">Breaking the 1000 msec Time-to-Glass Mobile Barrier</a> talk has some real-world statistics, and a fantastic description of how 3G/4G networks work and what causes the enormous latencies. His <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545">High Performance Browser Networking</a> book has <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545/ch07.html">even more details</a>. Enjoy!</p>
