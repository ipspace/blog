<p>Two years ago I wrote the another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat's_Last_Theorem">Fermatish</a> post: I described how <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/04/dmvpn-spoke-nhrp-behavior-changed-in.html">NHRP behavior changed in DMVPN networks using NAT</a> and claimed that it might be a huge problem, without ever explaining what the problem is.</p>
<p>Fabrice <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/04/dmvpn-spoke-nhrp-behavior-changed-in.html?showComment=1304374254012#c7665983883544403504">quickly identified the problem</a>, but it seems the description was not explicit enough as I’m still getting queries about that post ... so here’s a step-by-step description of what’s going on.<!--more--></p>
<p>A single DMVPN network has two hubs and two spokes. Spokes are behind NAT boxes (e.g. cable/DSL modems) that prevent IPsec session between the spokes to be established.</p>
<div class="separator"><a href="/2013/04/s1600-DMVPN_NHRP_Problem.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="/2013/04/s450-DMVPN_NHRP_Problem.jpg"/></a></div>
<p>When Spoke-A tries to establish communication with Spoke-B, the following events take place:</p>
<ol class="ListParagraph"><li>Spoke A sends NHRP request for Spoke B to one of the hub routers (H1).</li>
<li>At the same time spoke A creates fake NHRP entry for B pointing to H1 (this is the crux of the changes introduced in 15.0M).</li>
<li>H1 forwards the NHRP request to Spoke B.</li>
<li>Spoke B tries to establish IPsec tunnel to Spoke A to send the NHRP reply back to Spoke A. </li>
<li>If the B-to-A IPsec tunnel establishment fails, the NHRP reply never arrives to Spoke A, and Spoke A uses fake NHRP entry pointing to H1 till it expires (3 minutes).</li>
</ol>
<p>And now for the gotcha: Spoke A continues sending traffic toward H1 until the fake NHRP entry expires, regardless of whether H1 fails in the meantime or not. Only after the fake NHRP entry expires will Spoke A send another NHRP request to the hub router(s) alive at that time (H2). End result: traffic between Spoke A and Spoke B will be interrupted for up to three minutes even though you have redundant hubs in the DMVPN network.</p>
