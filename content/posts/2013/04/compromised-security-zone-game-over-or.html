title: Compromised Security Zone = Game Over (Or Not?)

<p>Kevin left a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/are-you-ready-to-change-your-security.html?showComment=1365545262207#c7200233166126035373">pretty valid comment</a> to my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/are-you-ready-to-change-your-security.html"><em>Are you ready to change your security paradigm</em></a><em> </em>blog post:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I disagree that a compromised security zone is game over. Security is built in layers. Those host in a compromised security zone should be hardened, have complex authentication requirements to get in them, etc. Just because a compromised host in a security zone can get at additional ports on the other hosts doesn't mean an attacker will be more successful.</blockquote>
<p>He’s right from the host-centric perspective (assuming you actually believe those other hosts are hardened), but once you own a server in a security zone you can start having fun with intra-subnet attacks.<!--more--></p>
<p>Here are just a few ideas (I’m positive decent pen-testers have dozens more):</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Spoof source IP addresses of other servers in the same security zone and execute denial-of-service attacks;</li>
<li>Combine the above with ARP spoofing and you might be able to get where those other servers can go;</li>
<li>Impersonate other servers in the same security zone with ARP spoofing to get access to the traffic sent within the security zone;</li>
<li>For the ultimate win, ARP spoof the IP address of the first-hop router (most routers might object to that, try to claim back their IP address, and generate all sorts of log messages);</li>
<li>Send ICMP redirects and persuade adjacent servers to pass traffic going to more secure zones to your server first; </li>
<li>Become a DHCP server and try to force other servers to use your server as DNS server.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these attacks can be mitigated with proper configuration of layer-2 switches. Would your ToR switches stop them?</p>
<p>Most of these attacks can also be stopped by the hypervisor virtual switches... assuming you bought the proper (more expensive) licenses. Are your vSwitches configured to use them?</p>
<p>However, the ultimate winner is: <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/10/you-must-take-control-of-ipv6-in-your.html">start sending IPv6 RA messages</a>. Most of the adjacent servers will <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/10/ipv6-stateless-autoconfiguration-101.html">auto-configure themselves</a>, and if they’re running Linux (and your data center is IPv6-ignorant) they’re probably missing <strong>ip6tables </strong>configuration, making them wide open. Even if that doesn’t work, you’ll still attract all IPv6 traffic (because you pretend to be a router) and you can push the DNS settings to most of the operating systems with <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/11/ipv6-router-advertisements-deep-dive.html">Other Config Flag</a> and DHCPv6.</p>
<p>I’m positive one could use this trick in most IPv6-ignorant environments (particularly the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/09/state-of-ipv6-in-data-center-gear.html">virtualized ones</a>). Would it work in your data center? No, you don’t have to share the answer, if it happens to be “YES”, go and fix the problem.</p>
