<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/crouthamela">Andrew Crouthamel</a> had a great idea – he decided to produce <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/crouthamela/free-cisco-ccna-video-training">free CCNA-level videos</a> and started a Kickstart campaign to get the funding. The initial response was overwhelming, so he included stretch goals: Wireshark training (WCNA – already reached) and CCNP.</p>
<p>He probably underestimated the costs of the project, but that doesn’t really matter. I’m positive he’ll deliver, so let’s help him get started – if only 10% of my readers donate a single morning Frapuccino to his project, he’ll have more than enough funding to get the whole CCNP curriculum done.</p>
