<p>When I wrote the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/11/virtual-switches-need-bpdu-guard.html"><em>Virtual switches need BPDU guard</em></a><em> </em>blog post, I speculated that you could shut down a whole HA cluster with a single BPDU-generating VM ... and got a nice confirmation during the <a href="https://www.troopers.de/archives/troopers13/index.html">Troopers 13 conference</a> â€“ <a href="https://www.ernw.de">ERNW</a> specialists successfully demonstrated the attack while testing the security aspects of a public cloud implementation for a major service provider.</p>
<p>For more information, read their <a href="http://www.insinuator.net/2013/04/bpdu-guard-bringing-down-infrastructures/">blog post</a> (they also have a nice presentation explaining how a <a href="https://www.ernw.de/download/ERNW_DCVI-HypervisorsToClouds.pdf">VM can read ESXi hard drive with properly constructed VMDK file</a>).</p>
