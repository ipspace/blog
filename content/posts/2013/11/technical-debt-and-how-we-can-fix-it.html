<p>In late October I had the closing presentation at our yearly customer event, and decided to talk about one of the most pressing (at least in my opinion) IT problems – the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debt</a> from the <a href="http://www.networkcomputing.com/data-networking-management/technical-debt-will-have-to-be-paid-back/240000835">networking</a>/<a href="http://lonesysadmin.net/2012/04/04/technical-debt/">sysadmin</a> perspective.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/Technical%20Debt.pdf">view the presentation on my web site</a>. It’s one of those presentations that look way better on video (which will be published … but it’s in Slovenian), but I’m positive the meme-lovers will enjoy it.</p>
