title: Programming the Network – A Few Guidelines

---

<p>Even though I questioned the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/09/do-you-really-want-to-program-your.html">wisdom of writing your own network programming applications</a>, I know I would immediately jump into those waters if I were 20 years younger. If you’re like my younger self, you might want to keep a few guidelines in mind.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Be conservative</strong>. You don’t have to use OpenFlow or OnePK to insert entries into routing table; BGP will do just fine. Sometimes EEM or a Tcl/Perl/Python script is all you need.</p>
<p>Your gear might also support <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/the-many-paths-to-sdn.html">other SDN-like technologies</a>. Use whatever is available – programming network devices is interesting enough without having to deal with bugs introduced by latest experimental firmware.</p>
<p><strong>Stay away from the data plane</strong>. If you can achieve your goals by reconfiguring the device with <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/06/netconf-expect-on-steroids.html">NETCONF</a>, go for it. If that doesn’t work consider interacting with control plane protocols (BGP is usually the best choice). </p>
<p>Intercepting user traffic with OpenFlow controller and downloading forwarding entries straight into the data plane should be the choice-of-last-resort. Anything else is easier to debug, monitor and troubleshoot.</p>
<p><strong>Stay away from real time operations</strong>. In the ideal case, your network devices already have the functionality you need, and you just need to automate their provisioning. Perfect low-hanging fruit; go for it. Try to use tools like Puppet or Chef instead of NETCONF, or create your own abstraction layer (see below).</p>
<p>Do you want to modify device behavior on-the-fly (example: time-based forwarding rules)? Be careful. Always consider worst-case scenarios – what happens if the controller crashes or if the controller state gets out-of-sync with the device state (or configuration). Try to use ephemeral device state (see below) instead of modifying device configuration.</p>
<p>Do you want to implement new device behavior, intercept control-plane traffic, or write your own protocols? Unless you have plenty of in-house resources (think <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/05/openflow-google-brilliant-but-not.html">Google</a>) don’t even try to do that in your production network. If you really want to do something along these lines, join a startup (or start your own).</p>
<p><strong>Create an abstraction layer</strong>. Don’t write spaghetti code that is tied to a particular device and software release (trust me, I’ve seen such code, and it isn’t pretty). </p>
<p>Define your high-level needs (example: add VLAN X to server group Y), turn them into an API or public methods of an object, and split your code in two parts: the generic part that handles user requests, and device-specific part that implements them. When you have to add support for more devices, you’ll add new instances of the device-specific code without touching the generic code. </p>
<p><strong>Don’t depend on the SDN controller</strong>. What happens if the SDN controller crashes? Will your network melt down or will it revert to business-as-usual hop-by-hop forwarding? Minimally-intrusive architectures like <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/10/exception-routing-with-bgp-sdn-done.html">BGP SDN</a> or ephemeral additions to routing tables done with BGP FlowSpec or Cisco’s OnePK are the safest choice. </p>
<p>Don’t forget that when bad things inevitably happen, it’s the <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/07/disasters-happen-its-recovery-that.html">graceful recovery</a> that matters most.</p>
<p><strong>Always have a backup plan</strong>. You might be tempted (or forced) to implement an architecture that relies solely on an SDN controller to work (it could be anything, from <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/PFlow#Videos">NEC’s ProgrammableFlow</a> to <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/09/qfabric-behind-curtain-i-was-spot-on.html">Juniper’s QFabric</a> or <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/11/cisco-nexus-9000-and-aci-promising-pv.html">Cisco's ACI</a>). There’s nothing wrong with that, but don’t put all the eggs in one basket – always have a well-documented backup plan. If the controller fails, or the controller software gets corrupted and crashes, you have to know what to do next.</p>
