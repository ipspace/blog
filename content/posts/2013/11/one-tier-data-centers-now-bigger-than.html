title: "One-Tier Data Centers? Now Bigger Than Ever with Arista 7300 Switches"

<p>Early November seems to be the right time for data center product harvest: after <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/11/finally-juniper-supports-leaf-and-spine.html">last week’s Juniper launch</a>, Arista launched its new switches on Monday. The launch was all we came to expect from Arista: better, faster, more efficient switches … and a dash of PureMarketing™ – the Splines.<!--more--></p>
<h4>The Switches</h4><p>Arista announced X-series switches with two product lines:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>7250QX-64 Top-of-Rack switch with 64 40GE ports in a 2RU form factor – a third less than what Nexus 6004 delivers, but in half the space (Nexus 6004 is 4RU high);</li>
<li>7300-series modular switches with 4. 8 or 16 linecards, and having up to 512 40GE ports or 2048 10GE ports – almost twice as many as the 7500E models launched only half a year ago.</li>
</ul>
<p class="more">You can read more about the new hardware in <a href="http://lamejournal.com/2013/11/04/arista-is-ok-fact-theyre-spline/">John Herbert’s blog post</a>.</p>
<h4>One-Tier Data Center</h4><p>Having a very-high-density modular switch, Arista’s marketing got creative – there’s no need for leaf-and-spine architectures if you can connect all the servers to a single pair of giant switches. </p>

<p>The idea is not new (and has a few limitations – more about them in an upcoming blog post). We’ve been using similar designs for years as most enterprise data centers these days <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/08/how-big-is-big-private-cloud.html">don’t need more than a rack of high-density servers</a> connected to two 10GE ToR switches anyway. </p>
<p>The only difference is the scale – you could connect around 50 servers to two ToR switches (you have to dedicate some ports to inter-server links, storage devices and external connectivity), now you can build a 2-switch network with forty times as many servers.</p>
<h4>But Wasn’t QFabric a One-Tier Data Center?</h4><p>Definitely – at least from the marketing perspective. QFabric is a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/09/qfabric-part-2-control-plane-overview.html">single management entity</a>, but it’s still a <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/09/qfabric-part-1-hardware-architecture.html">traditional leaf-and-spine architecture</a> with 1:3 oversubscription and 3 hops across the network (five if you count internal Clos fabric in interconnect nodes). Arista is the first vendor that allows you to build a one-tier (maybe I should write one hop) line-rate network connecting 1000+ servers.</p>
<h4>Splines? Seriously?</h4><p>We have the concept – one-hop line-rate network. We need a spiffy name. It’s no longer leaf-and-spine, it’s a Spline. Seriously? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline">Which one</a>? Maybe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mechanical)">this</a>?</p>
