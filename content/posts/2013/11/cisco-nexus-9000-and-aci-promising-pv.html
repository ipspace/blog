title: 'Cisco Nexus 9000 and ACI: Promising P+V Architecture'

<p>Last week’s Nexus 9000 and Application Centric Architecture launch triggered an avalanche of opinions. Some bloggers focused on the fact that there’s a Linux kernel underneath the NX-OS (So what? What else would make sense?), others tried to make sense of ACI from the marketing materials (good luck with that) … and almost nobody mentioned what might be a crucial piece of the architecture: the <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/introducing-cisco-application-virtual-switch-extending-virtual-networking-to-applications/">Application Virtual Switch</a> (AVS).<!--more--></p>
<p>A network architecture that allows a network services designer (or application developer) to specify a policy based on application endpoints (and not IP subnets, addresses, or port numbers) is definitely badly needed. A central orchestration system is clearly a must (whether you want to call it a controller or something else is a purely marketing decision). Most recently-launched virtual networking solutions include at least parts of both components – the real differentiator will be the dirty details.</p>
<p>I’m still convinced that it <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/07/smart-fabrics-versus-overlay-virtual.html">doesn’t make sense to implement highly granular (potentially down to the flow level) network policies in hardware</a> (at least it opens <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/10/forwarding-models-in-openflow-networks.html">too many cans of worms</a>). Such policies should be <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2011/05/complexity-belongs-to-network-edge.html">implemented in software in virtual switches</a> (software switching is way more flexible than hardware implementations and works relatively well at low speeds), with a few hardware gateways handling potential exceptions. The inclusion of AVS in Cisco’s Application Centric Architecture is definitely a positive sign.</p>
<p>So let’s assume eventual ACI implementation will go down the path of having edge functionality in virtual switches and core functionality in hardware (it <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/01/edge-and-core-openflow-and-why-mpls-is.html">does look like MPLS</a>, doesn’t it ;). How is that different from what <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/01/nec-launched-virtual-openflow-switch.html">NEC is doing</a>? Obviously there’s not much you can do from the architectural perspective – only a few combinations of hardware+software functionality give you the optimal price/performance. </p>
<p>The true differentiations will be the controller and edge services functionality: the network services supported by the controller, potential <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/application-centric-infrastructure-aci-application-network-profiles-for-security-and-network-services/">seamless chaining of network services</a>, optimal handling of <a href="http://networkheresy.com/2013/11/01/of-mice-and-elephants/">elephants and mice</a> … It’s way too early to judge how well ACI will handle these details – we’ll have to wait a few months for the dirty details to emerge. </p>

<h4>While waiting for the ACI details</h4><p>In the new few days I’ll update the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics">Data Center Fabric Architectures</a> slide deck to include new switch models from <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/11/finally-juniper-supports-leaf-and-spine.html">Juniper</a>, <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/11/one-tier-data-centers-now-bigger-than.html">Arista</a> and Cisco (as always, everyone who attended the webinar, bought the recording, or a subscription will be notified automatically) … and hope that I’ll have enough details to tell you more about ACI in the May update session.</p>
