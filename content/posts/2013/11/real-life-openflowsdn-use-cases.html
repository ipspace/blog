<p>While <a href="http://opennetworkingusergroup.com/about/press-info/onug-releases-prioritized-use-cases-to-lower-cost-and-ensure-greater-choice-in-software-defined-networking-solutions/">meeting-goers debate viable SDN use cases</a>, bleeding-edge engineers who weren't afraid to get their hands dirty started rolling out real-life OpenFlow- and SDN-based solutions. Iâ€™ll describe some of them (including smarter network monitoring, tap aggregation networks, scale-out appliances, and distributed DoS detection) in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Real_Life_OpenFlow-based_SDN_Use_Cases"><em>OpenFlow-based SDN Use Cases</em></a> webinar next Thursday. The webinar is free (NEC decided to sponsor it), but the number of places is limited, so <a href="https://openflowsdnusecases.eventbrite.com/?ref=blog">register ASAP</a>.</p>
