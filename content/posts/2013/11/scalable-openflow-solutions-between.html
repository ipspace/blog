<p>The <a href="http://www.sdncentral.com/shipping-sdn-products/"><em>Shipping SDN, NFV, OpenFlow, Network Virtualization Products and Services</em></a> page on SDN Central lists dozens of SDN products, from switches to controllers and applications. I’m positive all of them work great in PowerPoint, most of them work well in lab environments, but do they also work in large-scale production deployments?</p>
<p>If you’re a regular reader of my blog, you probably know all about OpenFlow scalability challenges, for everyone else I included a section on OpenFlow scalability in free <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Real_Life_OpenFlow-based_SDN_Use_Cases">Real Life OpenFlow-based SDN Use Cases</a> webinar (we have just a few places left - <a href="https://openflowsdnusecases.eventbrite.com">register here</a>).</p>
