<p>Francesco <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/virtual-appliance-performance-is.html?showComment=1366797224552#c4423604048461698530">made an interesting comment</a> to my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/virtual-appliance-performance-is.html">Virtual Appliance Performance</a> blog post:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Virtual Appliance Performance is comparable to the equivalent Physical Appliance until the latter use its own ASICs (for a good reason), e.g. Palo Alto with its new generation Firewall...</blockquote>
<p>Let’s do a bit of math combined with a few minutes of Googling ;)<!--more--></p>
<p>Palo Alto has numerous hardware models. The low-end ones <a href="http://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/platforms/PA-2000_Series.html">provide ~1 Gbps of throughput</a>, the flagship models go up to <a href="http://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/platforms/PA-5000_Series.html">20 Gbps of throughput</a>. They also offer a VM-based product that they claim has <a href="http://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/platforms/vm-series.html">1 Gbps of throughput</a> when running on four CPU cores.</p>
<p>High-end Cisco’s C-series servers have 4 processors with up to <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/ps10265/ps10493/c420M3_specsheet.pdf">8</a> or <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/ps10265/ps10493/ps11587/spec_sheet_c17-662220.pdf">10</a> cores per processor with prices “<a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps10493/prod_models_comparison.html">starting @ $7,950</a>”. Pushing 1 Gbps of “Palo Alto throughput” through that server requires one half of one processor or less, and you can push up to 10 Gbps of “next-generation firewalled” traffic through a <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/ps10265/ps10493/ps11587/spec_sheet_c17-662220.pdf">fully-loaded box</a> (which just happens to have two 10 Gbps interfaces).</p>
<p><a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF05a/15351-15351-3328412-241644-4222584-4231377.html?dnr=1">HP ProLiant DL980 G7 server</a> has 80 processor cores, for 20 Gbps of “next-generation firewalled” throughput ... and a very reassuring price tag of “starting @ $33,585”. Nah, I’d go for two C460-M2s.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the licensing fee you have to pay for the Palo Alto VM appliances isn’t exorbitantly high. According to an online price list I found some people get the <a href="http://www.technicacorp.com/federal/contracts/nasa_sewpiv/sewp_search?mpin_1=&amp;manufacturer=&amp;description=VM-200">VM-200 for $4,050</a> while the price list for <a href="http://www.technicacorp.com/federal/contracts/nasa_sewpiv/sewp_search?page=1385">full-blown PA-5060 on same web site</a>  exceeds $130,000. Even when buying twenty individual VM-200 licenses I’d have ~$50,000 left to buy the hardware (and there seems to be a <a href="http://www.technicacorp.com/federal/contracts/nasa_sewpiv/sewp_search?page=1&amp;mpin_1=&amp;manufacturer=&amp;description=VM-200">volume bundle with 25 licenses at ~$70.000</a>, leaving ~$60,000 for the hardware). Hmmm, maybe I could afford the DL980 G7 after all.</p>
<p class="note">Someone pointed out in one of my Interop presentations that you have to consider the increased power utilization when using multiple Intel servers instead of a single appliance - and he was absolutely right. For a complete picture, consider also related cooling costs and costs of the rack space.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> From my naively ignorant perspective there’s no good reason for dedicated ASICs in network services appliances ... unless you want to filter a single 10Gbps stream, in which case you probably have a design problem to start with.</p>
