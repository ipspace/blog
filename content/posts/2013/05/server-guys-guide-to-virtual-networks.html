title: Server Guy’s Guide to Virtual Networks
url: /2013/05/server-guys-guide-to-virtual-networks.html
---

<p>I was asked to do a short virtual networking presentation during this year’s <a href="http://www.ntk.si/">Microsoft NT Conference</a> in Slovenia. Most of the audience were server and virtualization administrators, having anywhere from zero to pretty decent networking knowledge; getting the right balance of basics and interesting features was a struggle.</p>
<p>They told me the <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/Server%20Guy%20s%20Guide%20to%20Virtual%20Networks.pdf">end result</a> wasn’t that bad. It’s a bit Microsoft-biased, but applies equally well to VMware (be it vSphere/VXLAN or Open vSwitch/NVP combo).</p>
