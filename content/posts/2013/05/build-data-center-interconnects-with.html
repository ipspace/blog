title: Build Data Center Interconnects with Enterasys Switches
url: /2013/05/build-data-center-interconnects-with.html
---

<p><strong>Short story:</strong> Enterasys data center switches have an interesting combination of time-tested routing and bridging features that allow you to build robust data center fabrics and interconnects (including the scenarios where you migrate VMs between them if you really must do so). </p>
<p>I’ll describe these features and how you can use them in a <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Enterasys">free webinar sponsored by Enterasys</a> (<a href="http://enterasys.eventbrite.com/">register here</a>). Don’t worry, that won’t make me biased; I still think moving a running VM between data centers makes no sense.</p>
<p>And now for a longer story ;)<!--more--></p>
<p>A while ago Markus Nispel from <a href="http://www.enterasys.com/">Enterasys</a> contacted me. I was vaguely aware of Enterasys, but not of their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabletron_Systems">circuitous history going all the way back to Cabletron Systems</a>, which brought back some really nice memories – we were Cabletron’s partner in early 1990s and the first Cisco router I installed and configured (running Cisco software release 8.2) was actually a blade for a MMAC-8 hub. Oh, I also managed to create my first spanning tree loop at that time bridging across parallel FDDI and Ethernet links (MMAC-8 had no STP on FDDI – draw your own conclusions).</p>
<div class="separator"><img src="http://www.bigkey.com/pic/Cabletron/Cabletron_MMAC_10base-T_network_chassie.jpg"/><br/>I think this is actually an MMAC-5, but you get the idea (source: bigkey.com)</div>
<p>You know that I love to rant about networking vendors inventing new technologies to solve problems that could have been solved with smart application of existing ones (and I’m not the only one – see the <a href="http://archive.psg.com/051000.sigcomm-ivtf.pdf">Spaghetti Wall’s Point of View</a> by Randy Bush). No wonder I got interested as Markus explained how Enterasys uses existing routing protocols and other L2 and L3 technologies in exactly the way I always wanted to see them used.</p>
<p>As always, it would be way too good to have it all – some features are available today, some will become available pretty soon, and you’ll get the whole feature set you need in autumn. </p>
<p>Interested? <a href="http://enterasys.eventbrite.com/">Register for the webinar on June 18<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span></a>.</p>
