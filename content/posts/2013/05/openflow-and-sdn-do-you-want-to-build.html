<p>The OpenFlow zealots are quick to point out the beauties of the centralized control plane, and the huge savings you can expect from using commodity hardware and open-source software. What they usually forget to tell you is that you also have to reinvent all the wheels the networking industry has invented in the last 30 years.<!--more--></p>
<p>Imagine you want to build your own F1 racing car ... but the only component you got is a super-duper racing engine from Mercedes Benz. You're left with the "easy" task of designing the car body, suspension, gears, wheels, brakes and a few other choice bits and pieces. You can definitely do all that if you're <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2012/05/openflow-google-brilliant-but-not.html">Google</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren">McLaren team</a>, but not if you're a Sunday hobbyist mechanic. No wonder some open-source OpenFlow controllers look like <a href="http://flugtag.redbull.com/_2013_flugtag_canada/gallery">Red Bull Flugtag contestants</a>.</p>
<p>Does that mean we should ignore OpenFlow? Absolutely not, but unless you want to become really fluent in real-time event-driven programming (which might look great on your resume), you should join me watching from the sidelines until there's a solid controller (maybe we'll get it with <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2013/04/the-first-glimpse-of-open-daylight.html">Daylight</a>, <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2012/08/openstackquantum-sdn-based-virtual.html">Floodlight</a> definitely doesn't fit the bill) and some application architecture blueprints. </p>
<p>Till then, it might make sense to focus on <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2013/04/the-many-paths-to-sdn.html">more down-to-earth technologies</a>; after all, you don't exactly need <a href="http://www.jedelman.com/1/post/2013/04/goldman-sachs-is-deploying-sdn-are-you.html">OpenFlow and a central controller</a> to solve real-life problems, like Tail-f clearly demonstrated with their <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2013/05/tail-f-network-control-system-first.html">NCS software</a>.</p>
