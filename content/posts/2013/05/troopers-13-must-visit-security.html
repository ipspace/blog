<p>If you live in Europe and happen to be interested in security, make sure you put <a href="https://www.troopers.de/">Troopers</a> on the list of must-attend events. Like many things coming from Europe it’s a boutique event (limited to 200 attendees even if it means it’s sold out – that would never happen in some other parts of the world) with some <a href="https://www.troopers.de/archives/troopers13/agenda13/index.html">great content</a>.</p>
<p>Enno Rey, the mastermind behind the event, was kind enough to invite me to talk about virtual firewall architectures – you can <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/Virtual%20Firewalls%20-%20Troopers%2013.pdf">view my presentation</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ineR4h66Nw">watch the video</a> – and of course I used the opportunity to visit a <a href="http://www.boulderhaus.de/about.html">not-so-well-known Heidelberg attraction</a> ;)</p>
