title: Are stateless ACLs good enough?

<p>In one of his Open Networking Summit blog posts <a href="http://www.jedelman.com/1/post/2013/04/goldman-sachs-is-deploying-sdn-are-you.html">Jason Edelman summarized the presentation</a> in which Goldman Sachs described its plans to replace <a href="/2013/03/the-spectrum-of-firewall-statefulness.html#statefulFW">stateful firewalls</a> with <a href="/2013/03/the-spectrum-of-firewall-statefulness.html#ACL">packet filters</a> (see also a similar post by <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/03/why-hardware-firewalls-are-the-walking-dead/">Nick Buraglio</a>).</p>
<p>These ideas are obviously not new – as Merike Kaeo succinctly said in her <a href="http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog48/presentations/Monday/Kaeo_FilterTrend_ISPSec_N48.pdf">NANOG presentation</a> over three years ago “<em>stateful firewalls make absolutely no sense in front of servers, given that by definition every packet coming into the server is unsolicited</em><em>.</em>” Real life is usually a bit more complex than that.<!--more--></p>
<h4>The ideal world</h4><p>Assuming an ideal world where servers are just that – software listening on TCP or UDP ports – it makes no sense to use stateful firewalls in front of them. All you need is a simple packet filter permitting traffic to TCP and UDP ports you want to have reachable from the outside world … assuming you’re using a recent regularly patched operating system that will not fall over when receiving overlapping or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_of_death">out-of-bounds IP fragments</a>.</p>
<p>In these environments, a stateful firewall is nothing more than a crutch. It must be those ancient apps nobody is allowed to touch ;) … or maybe the stateful firewalls are just CYA devices.</p>
<h4>Getting closer to real life</h4><p>In the real life, each server is a client. For example, in most scale-out application deployments web servers need information from the database servers, authentication servers, cache servers, name servers … and in all those cases they act as <em>clients</em> using unpredictable source TCP/UDP port numbers.</p>
<p>You can still use ACLs in a mixed client/server environment, but you can never control the traffic as tightly as a stateful firewall would.</p>
<p><strong>ACLs</strong><strong> with automatic reverse rules</strong>: Some products, like XenServer vSwitch Controller, add <a href="/2013/03/the-spectrum-of-firewall-statefulness.html#reverseACL">reverse inbound ACL rules to outbound ACL and vice versa</a>. </p>
<p>For example, you might want to permit inbound (toward the server) traffic to TCP port 80 and outbound (from the server) traffic to TCP port 3306 (MySQL) on the database server. In reality, what you get is an outbound ACL that permits traffic to TCP port 3306 on the database server and all traffic coming from TCP port 80.</p>
<p>I would love to pwn a system “protected” with such an ACL. You can open TCP sessions to anywhere you want – just kill <em>httpd </em>and open your own TCP session from port 80 (you do have to be root to do that).</p>
<p><strong>ACLs matching established sessions</strong>: If your ACLs support <a href="/2013/03/the-spectrum-of-firewall-statefulness.html#establishedACL">matching on TCP flags</a> (the famous <strong>established </strong>keyword of Cisco IOS), you can tighten the security quite a bit. Using the previous example, inbound ACL would match TCP traffic to port 80 and established sessions, while the outbound ACL would match TCP traffic to port 3306 on the database server and established sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Two subnets</strong>: In more complex environments you could use servers with two interfaces. For example, you could permit inbound TCP traffic to port 80 and outbound established sessions from port 80 on the user-facing interface, and have no restrictions on the inside-facing interface. </p>
<p>Obviously you’d have to protect the inside servers, so you might want to use private VLANs on the inside subnet (to prevent hopping between web servers in case one gets pwned) and protect the servers residing in the common part (primary VLAN) of the private VLAN with rigorous ACLs. </p>
<p>Is any one of the above solutions good enough for your environment? Would it pass your security audit? Are you using it? Please share your thoughts – write a comment.</p>
<h4>Reflexive ACLs?</h4><p>No, I haven’t missed them. They are <a href="/2013/03/the-spectrum-of-firewall-statefulness.html#reflexiveACL">no better than stateful firewalls</a> from scalability perspective, and they are (almost) impossible to implement in hardware:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>First packet of each session has to be punted to the CPU to create the reflexive per-flow ACL entry;</li>
<li>The per-flow ACL entries will quickly overflow the switch TCAM.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just two data points: Arista’s 7150 has 20,000 ACL entries (~300 per port); Nexus 5500 has 1664 ingress and 2048 egress ACL entries (in total, not per port). Not much for a high-end server environment, is it?</p>
