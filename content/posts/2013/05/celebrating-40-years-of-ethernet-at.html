<p>Did you know <a href="https://www.parc.com/event/1912/bob-metcalfe-leads-a-celebration-of-40-years-of-ethernet-innovation.html">Ethernet turned 40 today</a>? I didn't (I was never good at tracking anniversaries), but <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/krisamundson">Kris Amundson</a> (the engineer keeping his network up and running in pitch dark Antarctica) quickly brought it to my attention with wonderful photos of South Pole Ethernet network built @ -69C (that's -92F if you're still ignoring the metric system).</p>

<p>Even better, they still have a thick coax cable with transceiver screwed into it!</p>
