<p><a href="http://www.daedtech.com/additional-information/about">Erik Dietrich</a> obviously hates the self-proclaimed (usually clueless) “experts” – he devoted a whole series of blog posts to them:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><a href="http://www.daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner">Rise of the Expert Beginner</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.daedtech.com/how-software-groups-rot-legacy-of-the-expert-beginner">Legacy of the Expert Beginner</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.daedtech.com/how-stagnation-is-justified-language-of-the-expert-beginner">Language of the Expert Beginner</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.daedtech.com/up-or-not-ambition-of-the-expert-beginner">Ambitions of the Expert Beginner</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m positive you know at least a few people that would match his descriptions. Enjoy!</p>
