<p>Andrew is struggling with MPLS/VPN providers and sent me the following question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Is "carriers carrier" a real service? I'm having a bit of an issue at the moment with too many MPLS providers […] Carrier’s carrier would be an answer to many of them, but none of the carriers admit to being able to do this, so I was wondering if it's simply that I'm speaking to the wrong people, or whether they really don't...</blockquote>
<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> I have yet to see this particular unicorn roaming the meadows of reality.<!--more--></p>
<p>Carrier’s Carrier (CsC) seemed like a perfect idea for wholesale (transit) provides in the early days of MPLS – I know at least one of the big ones was pushing very hard to get it done. Transit providers could use CsC to offer their MPLS/VPN services as a transit MPLS backbone for other (smaller) MPLS/VPN providers. </p>
<p>However, even though CsC it was conceptually simple (all you had to do was to configure LDP or EBGP with labels on PE-CE link) I’ve never seen it working, and I’m guessing that most of the transit providers prefer offering VPLS (or other EoX) services – they’re way less hassle for the same money.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Carrier’s Carrier is nothing more than the ability to build your own MPLS/VPN service on top of someone else’s infrastructure, and probably won't solve your inter-provider issues. If you’re experiencing routing problems with your MPLS/VPN providers, stop bothering – use directly-connected subnets as transport endpoints, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/12/where-would-you-need-gre.html">build GRE or MGRE tunnels on top of the providers’ MPLS/VPN network</a>, and run your own routing protocols on top of them.</p>
