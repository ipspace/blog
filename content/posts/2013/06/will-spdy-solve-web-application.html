title: Will SPDY Solve Web Application Performance Issues?

---

<p>In the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/TCP,_HTTP_and_SPDY">TCP, HTTP and SPDY</a> webinar I described the <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/SPDY/1 - The Problem.mp4 ">web application performance roadblocks</a> caused by <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/SPDY/2 - TCP and HTTP.mp4">TCP and HTTP</a> and <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/SPDY/4 - TCP and HTTP Improvements.mp4">HTTP improvements</a> that remove most of them. Google went a step further and created SPDY, a totally redesigned HTTP. What is SPDY? Is it really the final solution? How much does it help? Hopefully youâ€™ll find <a href="https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/SPDY/5 - SPDY.mp4">answers to some of these questions</a> in the last part of the webinar.</p>
