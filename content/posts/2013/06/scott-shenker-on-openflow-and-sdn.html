<p><a href="http://networkstatic.net/">Brent Salisbury</a> sent me a link to a <a href="http://ee380.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/videologger.php?target=130515-ee380-300.asx">fantastic OpenFlow/SDN presentation</a> <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/shenker.html">Scott Shenker</a> did @ <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/">Stanford University</a> a few days ago. It’s a perfect introduction to the fundamental ideas behind SDN and therefore a must-see for everyone vaguely involved in networking.</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights (from my highly biased perspective):<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>They got it all wrong in the first iteration (@ 20:00) – it’s rare to see someone being so honest about past misconceptions;</li>
<li>Network virtualization is the killer app, and SDN is just a means to an end (@ 25:00);</li>
<li>MPLS was right (@ 32:00) – would love to see the reaction of a well-known SDN evangelist and MPLS basher ;)</li>
<li>A network should have a complex edge and a simple core, with software switching at the edge (@ 38:00);</li>
<li>Today’s networks are full of middleboxes which are already x86-based. The functionality of these middleboxes should be moved to x86-based devices at the network edge (@ 42:00);</li>
<li>Network latency (actually intra-switch latency) doesn’t matter at the edge (@ 49:00).</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s still a lot of <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/handwave.html">handwaving</a> and missing details, particularly as you move from tightly controlled environments (data centers) to large-scale WAN networks where individual components have to operate independently to be failure-resilient, but they’ll eventually get there.</p>
<p>This would be a perfect place to smugly list my blog posts (going all the way <a href="/2011/10/openflow-and-state-explosion/">back to 2011</a>) talking about exactly these same things ... but it’s sunny outside and the kids are waiting ;)</p>
