<p>During the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics_Update">recent Data Center Fabrics Update</a> webinar Dan Backman from Plexxi explained how their <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/5.20%20-%20Plexxi%20Affinity%20Networking.mp4">innovative use of CWDM technology and controller-assisted forwarding simplifies deployment and growth</a> of reasonably-sized data center fabrics. </p>
<p>I would highly recommend that you watch the video – the start is a bit short on details, but he does cover all the juicy aspects later on.</p>
