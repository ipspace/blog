<p>Andreas was watching my recent <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Enterasys_Robust_Data_Center_Interconnect_Solutions">Enterasys DCI webinar</a> and got intrigued by the quick hand drawings I made, so he asked me “<em>What kind of tool do you use to make the hand drawings during your presentations? It must be something different than a mouse.</em>”</p>
<p>In case you weren’t watching one of my recent webinars, here’s a sample to get you started:<!--more--></p>
<div class="separator"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/sfa1WcezfPo?rel=0" width="420"></iframe></div>
<p>The magic tool in that I use is <a href="http://www.wacom.eu/index2.asp?pid=7005&amp;spid=4&amp;lang=en">Wacom Cintiq 12WX</a> interactive pen display. It connects to my PC as the second monitor that I use as the presentation monitor for my PowerPoint presentations, and the pen acts like a mouse.</p>
<p>PowerPoint allows you to draw on slides (move the mouse when you’re in slide show mode, click the barely visible pen icon in the bottom-right corner and explore the options), and GoToMeeting shares that whole screen with the audience. On top of that, Camtasia Recorder records the Wacom Cintiq screen and my audio.</p>
<p><strong>Could I use WebEx instead of GoToMeeting?</strong> Not sure. Tried to do that on a Mac and got WebEx totally confused – it could not share the screen I wanted. Never had a single screen-sharing glitch with GoToMeeting.</p>
<p><strong>Could I use some other software, not PowerPoint?</strong> Absolutely. I’m using SketchPad to draw the diagrams in my interactive videos.</p>
<p><strong>Could I use GoToWebinar recording instead of Camtasia Recorder?</strong> Absolutely not. Every single virtual classroom software that I tried has totally useless codec/bitrate settings that you cannot change. These tools are aimed at people that are too distracted to get a proper headset, and since the voice quality sucks anyway, they don’t complain about the quality of the recording. Would you be willing to listen to several hours of bad-quality recordings? I wouldn’t.</p>
<p>BTW, <a href="http://www.plantronics.com/us/product/audio-400-dsp">this is the headset</a> that I use (hat tip to Greg Ferro for recommending it). It’s a good headset, but the real trick is in the foam that covers the mike. <a href="http://www.plantronics.com/us/product/blackwire-700">Another headset from Plantronics</a> produces way too much background noise to be usable.</p>
