<p>Brad Hedlund wrote another great article, this one explaining the <a href="http://bradhedlund.com/2013/05/28/what-is-network-virtualization/">fundamentals of network virtualization</a>. As you'll see, VMware (and everyone else) aims way higher than replacing VLANs with overlay networks. Highly recommended!</p>
