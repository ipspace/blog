title: Dirty Details of Inter-DC VM- and IP Address Mobility

<p>The upcoming <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Enterasys_Robust_Data_Center_Interconnect_Solutions">Data Center Interconnect</a> webinar (<a href="http://enterasys.eventbrite.com">register</a>) is sponsored by <a href="http://www.enterasys.com">Enterasys Networks</a>, so it’s obvious that I’ll also mention how you can use their technology to solve particular data center interconnect problems, but that’s not all. The webinar will focus primarily on Whys, Hows and Whats of solving VM- and IP address mobility challenges in multi-data center environments.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the topics we’ll cover:<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><em>Why</em> do you need layer-2 data center interconnect for live (hot) VM mobility and <em>how</em> does a VM communicate with other VMs in the same segment?</li>
<li><em>Why </em>don’t you need layer-2 DCI for cold VM mobility and <em>how</em> does a migrated VM communicate with other VMs in the same segment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">These questions apply equally well to what Enterasys is doing and to LISP-based VM mobility solutions proposed by Cisco.</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li><em>How</em> does layer-3 pinning impact traffic patterns across data center and between data centers and <em>what</em> can you do to eliminate it and optimize the ingress and egress traffic flows?</li>
<li><em>How </em>can you ensure security zone separation in layer-3 DCI designs and <em>when </em>would it make sense to deploy MPLS/VPN?</li>
<li><em>Why</em> do stateful devices like firewalls and load balancers break the optimal traffic forwarding and <em>what</em> can be done to alleviate that?</li>
<li><em>How</em> do overlay virtual networks integrate with the above concepts and <em>what</em> can you do to use overlay networks with other IP- and VM mobility technologies?</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, we’ll cover plenty of generic data center/virtualization topics – <a href="http://enterasys.eventbrite.com">register ASAP</a> before we run out of space.</p>
