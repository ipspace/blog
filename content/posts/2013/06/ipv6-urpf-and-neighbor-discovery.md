IPv6 source address spoofing should be old news -- it's no different from its IPv4 counterpart. [Neighbor discovery exhaustion attack](https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/05/ipv6-neighbor-discovery-exhaustion.html) is an IPv6-only phenomenon enabled by huge IPv6 subnet sizes.

During the [IPv6 Security](http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_security) webinar, Eric Vyncke described Cisco IOS mechanisms you can use to cope with both. Enjoy!
