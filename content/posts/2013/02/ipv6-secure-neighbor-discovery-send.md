During the [IPv6 Security webinar](http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_security), Eric Vyncke [explained the intricate details of IPv6 Security Neighbor Discovery (SEND)](http://demo.ipspace.net/get/D3%20Secure%20Neighbor%20Discovery.mp4) and the reasons it will probably never take off.

{{<note warn>}}If you happen to have masochistic tendencies and too much time, please do use SEND; it's been available on Cisco IOS for a while, and there are "plenty" of [host implementations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Neighbor_Discovery_Protocol) to choose from.{{</note>}}
