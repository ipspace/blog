<p>Brad Hedlund made a <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2013/01/nec-launched-virtual-openflow-switch.html?showComment=1359669279989#c3603529289800692734">pretty valid comment</a> to my “<a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2013/01/nec-launched-virtual-openflow-switch.html"><em>NEC Launched a Virtual OpenFlow Switch</em></a><em>”</em> blog post: “On the other hand, it's NEC end-to-end or no dice”, implicating the ultimate vendor lock-in. </p>
<p>Of course he’s right and while, as Bob Plankers explains, you can never escape some lock-in (<a href="http://lonesysadmin.net/2012/12/29/openstack-isnt-our-savior-from-lock-in-or-support-costs/">part 1</a>, <a href="http://etherealmind.com/response-openstack-isnt-our-savior-from-lock-in-or-support-costs-the-lone-sysadmin/">response from Greg Ferro</a>, <a href="http://lonesysadmin.net/2013/01/31/openstack-lock-in-support-costs-and-open-source-free-lunches/">part 2</a> – all definitely worth reading), you do have to ask yourself “<em>am I looking for Windows or Mac?</em>”<!--more--></p>
<p>There are all sorts of arguments one hears from Mac fanboys (here’s a <a href="http://community.brocade.com/community/brocadeblogs/data_center/blog/2012/09/07/what-networking-needs-to-learn-from-steve-jobs">networking related one</a>) but regardless of <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/11/macbook-air-mixed-feelings-or-is-it.html">what you think of Mac and OSX</a>, there’s the undisputable truth: compared to reloadful experience we get on most Windows-based boxes, Macs and OSX are rock solid; I have to reboot my Macbook every other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_moon">blue moon</a>. Even Windows is stable when running on a Macbook (apart from upgrade-induced reboots).</p>
<p>Before you start praising Steve Jobs and blaming Bill Gates and Microsoft at large, consider a simple fact: OSX runs on a tightly controller hardware platform built with stability and reliability in mind. Windows has to run on <a href="http://blog.fosketts.net/2013/01/07/microsoft-kill-craptops-destroy-windows/">every possible underperforming concoction a hardware vendor throws at you</a> (example: my “high-end” laptop cannot record system audio because the 6-letter hardware vendor wanted to save $0.02 on the sound chipset and chose the cheapest possible one), and has to deal with all sort of crap third-party device drivers loaded straight into the operating system kernel.</p>
<p>Now, what do you want to have in your mission-critical SDN/OpenFlow data center networking infrastructure: a Mac-like tightly controlled and vendor-tested mix of equipment and associated controller, or a Windows-like hodgepodge of boxes from numerous vendors, controlled by third-party software that might have never encountered the exact mix of the equipment you have. </p>
<p>If you’re young and brazen (like I was two decades ago), go ahead and be your own system integrator. If you’re too old and covered with vendor-inflicted scars, you might prefer a tested end-to-end solution regardless of what <a href="http://h30507.www3.hp.com/t5/HP-Networking/Mythbusting-with-Gartner-The-multi-vendor-network/ba-p/83559">Gartner says in vendor-sponsored reports</a> (and even solutions that vendor X claims were tested don’t always work). Just don’t forget to <a href="http://erratasec.blogspot.com/2013/02/risk-analysis-v-downtime.html">consider the cost of downtime</a> in your total-cost-of-ownership calculations.</p>
