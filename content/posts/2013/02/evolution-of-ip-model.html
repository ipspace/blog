I stumbled upon a fantastic RFC - <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6250">Evolution of IP Model (RFC 6250)</a> - that should be made mandatory reading for everyone remotely involved with networking. It describes numerous "truths" (politely called misconceptions) that everyone from programmers to network designers still rely upon. Some of my favorites: reachability is symmetric and transitive, loss is rare, addresses are stable, each host has a single interface and a single IP address ... Enjoy!
