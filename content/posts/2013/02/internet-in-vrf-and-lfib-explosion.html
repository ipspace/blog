<p><a href="http://twitter.com/bigmstone">Matthew Stone</a> encountered another unintended consequence of <a href="/2012/07/is-it-safe-to-run-internet-in-vrf.html">full Internet routing in a VRF</a> design: the TCAM on his 6500 was 80% utilized even though he has the new Sup modules with one million IPv4 routes. </p>
<p>A closer look revealed the first clue: L3 forwarding resources on a Cat6500 are shared between IPv4 routes and MPLS labels (don’t know about you, but I was not aware of that) and half the entries were consumed by MPLS labels:<!--more--></p>

<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>MPLS labels are not assigned to BGP routes in the global routing table. When the router <a href="/2010/09/ribs-and-fibs.html">copies BGP routes from RIB into FIB</a>, it uses the labels its downstream neighbor allocated to the BGP next hop. All BGP routes advertised by the same BGP next hop thus get the same label.</li>
<li>A unique MPLS label is assigned to every VRF route when it’s imported into VPNv4 address family. In the Internet-in-the-VRF design, the Internet edge PE-routers receive Internet routing through EBGP sessions running in a VRF, and those routes automatically appear in the VPNv4 address family (and get their labels) even if they are never propagated to other PE-routers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Net result: if you have plenty of BGP routes in the global routing table (for example, around 450.000), your router allocates a local MPLS label for each BGP next hop. If those routes move to a VRF, your router allocates a local MPLS label for each route.</p>
<h4>Why all the fuss?</h4><p>To make the long story short: the creators of the MPLS architecture wanted to minimize forwarding hardware requirements and thus created a solution that ensures LSRs (including PE-routers) forward the packets (both IPv4 and labeled packets) with a single lookup in a single table.</p>
<p>The proof is left as an exercise for the reader. I know a really good one, but it wouldn’t fit in the sidebar of this blog post.</p>
<h4>Can we fix it? Yes we can!</h4><p>Wherever there’s a challenge, there’s a kludge. In this particular case, the magic command is <strong>mpls label mode vrf Internet protocol all-afs per-vrf</strong>. This command changes the label allocation mechanism from one-label-per-prefix to one-label-per-VRF. </p>
<p>With the changed label allocation model, the incoming label no longer uniquely identifies the outgoing interface and IP next hop. The egress PE-router thus has to perform two lookups: label lookup to identify the next lookup table (VRF FIB), and IPv4 destination address lookup in the VRF FIB. </p>
<p>The performance hit on the Cat 6500 seems to be minimal (at least <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/mpls/configuration/guide/mp_vpn_per_vrf_lbl.pdf">the documentation</a> claims so), but you lose the ability to do EIBGP multipathing (IPv4 lookup in the egress PE-router could lead to forwarding loops) and Carrier’s Carrier functionality (IPv4 lookup in the egress PE-router breaks the end-to-end LSP between CE-routers) in the VRFs for which you’ve configured per-VRF label allocation.</p>
