<p>That’s definitely a noble engineering goal, the “only” problem is that I don’t know many customers who would be willing to foot the bill.<!--more--></p>
<p>There was a car manufacturer that used that same motto – they would do whatever to please the customer, regardless of how demanding they were.</p>
