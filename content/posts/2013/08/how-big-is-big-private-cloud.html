<p>During the <a href="http://packetpushers.net/pq-show-28-ucs-director-overview-sponsored/">UCS Director Overview</a> Packet Pushers Podcast I listened to recently the participants started discussing the use cases and someone mentioned that UCS Director might not be applicable for small shops with only a few thousand VMs. Let's put that in perspective.<!--more--></p>
<p>I was discussing a private cloud project with a large enterprise and they were talking about a few hundred servers they planned to move into a private cloud.</p>
<p>Another one of my customers is a global financial organization and their target deployment size is less than 10.000 virtual machines.</p>
<p>Anecdata seems to suggest large enterprises with tens of thousands of employees need a few thousand VMs at most (unless they're deploying VDI).</p>
<p>Now, if a few thousand VMs is a small shop, who is a large shop? How big are your private cloud deployments?</p>
