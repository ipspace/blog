A while ago [Tomasz Kacprzynski](http://kemot-net.com/about) asked me whether I'd ever run RSVP over DMVPN. I hadn't - after all, you'd only need that in VoIP environments and I try to stay as far away from voice as possible.

In the meantime, Tomasz solved the problem (short summary: you have to turn Phase 3 DMVPN into Phase 2 DMVPN) and wrote a [lengthy blog post describing the problem (RSVP split horizon rule) and his solution](http://kemot-net.com/blog/making-rsvp-work-over-dvmpn) (including numerous debugging printouts). Definitely worth reading if there's a non-zero chance you'll have to get the two working together.
