title: Do we need LACP and UDLD?

<p>The Nexus-focused Packet Pushers were discussing a great question during <a href="http://packetpushers.net/pq-show-007-cisco-nexus-deep-dive-part-2-virtual-port-channel/">Cisco Nexus Deep Dive part 2</a> podcast: do we need LACP on top of UDLD? </p>
<p>Short answer: absolutely.<!--more--></p>
<p>LACP and UDLD serve two different functions: </p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>UDLD detects physical link errors and byzantine failures (example: unidirectional fiber link);</li>
<li>LACP manages the link aggregation groups (LAG, aka port channel) and detects LAG configuration and wiring errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: LACP can detect a miswired port channel connected to multiple physical switches (that’s why we need <a href="/2010/10/multi-chassis-link-aggregation-basics.html">MLAG</a>). UDLD can’t do that. </p>
<p>LACP is thus <em>mandatory</em> in a robust network using link aggregation (and after years of <a href="/2011/01/vmware-vswitch-does-not-support-lacp.html">yammering</a>, it finally <a href="http://rickardnobel.se/archives/1391">works in vSphere 5.1</a>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can’t tune the LACP timers or timeout values. The 802.1AX standard defines two timer values: short timer (1 second) or long timer (default, 30 seconds) with corresponding timeouts being 3 seconds or 90 seconds. </p>
<p>You can tune UDLD timeouts, with the valid values (in Nexus OS) being between 7 and 90 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> </p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>If you need very fast failure detection, use LACP short timers. </li>
<li>If you need to detect failures within 10-20 seconds, use UDLD. </li>
<li>Use UDLD (if needed) in combination with LACP on port channels.</li>
<li>Never ever run port channels without LACP (unless you’re forced to interact with a lobotomized device).</li>
</ul>
