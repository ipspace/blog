title: State of IPv6 in the Data Center Gear

<p>Just in case you haven’t noticed: <a href="http://www.ripe.net/internet-coordination/news/ripe-ncc-begins-to-allocate-ipv4-address-space-from-the-last-8">RIPE region ran out of unallocated IPv4 addresses</a> last Friday. RIPE members (regional registries) <a href="http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-553#-----use-of-last-8-for-pa-allocations">can get a single /22 each</a>, enterprises that want to be IPv4-multihomed cannot get provider-independent addresses any more. It just might be time to start considering IPv6 in your data center. Let’s see whether the vendors agree with me.<!--more--></p>
<h4>Data center switches</h4><p>I have some great news for you: most vendors started supporting IPv6 in their data center switches. </p>
<p>Cisco added IPv6 support on Nexus 5500 in the latest software release (all other Cisco’s DC switches supported IPv6 for quite a while), and Arista EOS documentation has a section on IPv6, although the data sheets still claim IPv6 will be supported in a future release.</p>
<p>All switches from Dell Force10 and HP, as well as EX-series switches from Juniper and MLX switches from Brocade had IPv6 support for a long time, as did Avaya and Alcatel Lucent.</p>
<p>And the products stuck in IPv4-only-land? Juniper’s QFabric has very limited IPv6 support in Junos release 12.2 (static routes on network node group only), Brocade VDX switches will support layer-3 forwarding with the new Network OS 3.0, but only for IPv4, and NEC ProgrammableFlow switches are still IPv4-only devices.</p>
<p class="info">To learn more about the progress data center fabric vendors are making, <a href="http://dcfabric.eventbrite.com/">register</a> for the November’s <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics">Data Center Fabrics</a> <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics_Update">update session</a>.</p>
<h4>Firewalls and load balancers</h4><p>Most (physical) firewalls and load balancers supported IPv6 for a while. There <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/09/ipv6-support-in-ciscos-data-center-gear.html">were some notable exceptions</a>, but that’s gruesome history that we should quickly forget.</p>
<h4>Virtual appliances</h4><p>These people must be living on a different planet. Obviously the virtual versions of physical appliances (example: BIG-IP virtual edition from F5) support IPv6, but one would hope that the vendors claiming to be focused on network virtualization wouldn’t forget that there’s life beyond virtual MACs and IPv4.</p>

<p>Nexus 1000V, Virtual Security Gateway (VSG) and vShield Edge (oops, VMware vCloud Networking and Security) have no IPv6 support. Juniper has <a href="http://www.securityweek.com/juniper-enhances-virtual-gateway-performance-boost-ipv6-support">announced IPv6 in its vGW Virtual Gateway</a>, but the <a href="http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/vgw/information-products/pathway-pages/vgw-series/product/">supporting documentation hasn’t found its way to Juniper’s web yet</a>.</p>
<p>The clear winner in this category: Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/asa/asa87/configuration/guide/intro_intro.html#wp1274327">does not support IPv6</a>. Let me get this straight: you took ASA code that had IPv6 support since (at least) release 7.0(1) from June 2007 and <em>you removed IPv6 from it</em>? Wow. Just wow.</p>
<h4>Do we care?</h4><p>You might not. You might decide <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/get/Getting%20Ready%20for%20WIPv6D%206%20Days.pdf">deploying 6-to-4 load balancer in front of your legacy data center</a> is good enough for the next 25 years. However, there are a “few people” that do – the service providers trying to provide common services to their data center clients. They cannot rely on coordinated usage of network 10.0.0.0/8 and thus have to provide the common services on public IPv4 addresses. Somewhat hard if you can’t get them, don’t you think?</p>
