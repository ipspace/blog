<p><a href="/2012/11/virtual-firewall-taxonomy.html?showComment=1352442525832#c3036832887938641360">Kaage added a great comment</a> to my <a href="/2012/11/virtual-firewall-taxonomy.html">Virtual Firewall Taxonomy</a> post:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">And many of physical firewalls can be virtualized. One physical firewall can have multiple virtual firewalls inside. They all have their own routing table, rule base and management interface.</blockquote>
<p>He’s absolutely right, but there’s a huge difference between security contexts (to use the ASA terminology) and firewalls running in VMs.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Transport network independence:</strong> firewalls running in VMs rely on the underlying hypervisor to provide network connectivity – you connect firewall’s virtual NICs to VLANs, VXLAN segments or <a href="/2012/08/openstackquantum-sdn-based-virtual.html">whatever other virtual networking technology you prefer</a> through hypervisor management tools (example: vCenter, vCNS, vCloud Director ...). You can thus use the VM-based firewalls with any virtual networking technology.</p>
<p>Security contexts in a physical firewall can use those virtual networking technologies that are provided by the firewall operating system. Today we’re limited to VLANs; no physical firewall I’m aware of supports VXLAN or NVGRE.</p>
<p class="note">Is there a firewall supporting MPLS/VPN PE-router functionality? Please write a comment.</p>
<p><strong>Configuration management:</strong> Configuration of a security context is stored in the physical firewall. If you want to move the firewalling functionality (example: data center migration), you have to copy the configuration to another physical firewall.</p>
<p class="warn">Please don’t even mention the <a href="/2011/04/distributed-firewalls-how-badly-do-you.html">incredibly creative idea of running a stretched active/active firewall cluster across two data centers</a>. Been there, moved on.</p>
<p>Configuration of a VM-based firewall is usually stored on its virtual disk. Moving the firewall and its configuration to a different physical location is thus a simple point-and-click exercise (well, maybe not if you want to move a running firewall, but you know what I mean).</p>
<p><strong>Workload mobility:</strong> It’s extremely easy to move a VM-based firewall with the workload it’s protecting, significantly simplifying disaster recovery procedures (example: VMware’s SRM). Moving the configuration of a physical firewall during the disaster recovery process is an intriguing task, more so if you have to merge it with an existing configuration of the target firewall.</p>
<p><strong>What next?</strong> It’s obvious we need better terminology ... or an agreement that there are <em>security contexts </em>and VM/hypervisor-based <em>virtual firewalls</em>. Comments?</p>
