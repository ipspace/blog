title: More real-life DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation gotchas

<p>The murky details of IPv6 implementations never crop up till you start deploying it (or, as Randy Bush <a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/v6ops/current/msg14625.html">recently wrote</a>: “<em>it is cheering to see that the ipv6 ivory tower still stands despite years of attack by reality</em>”).</p>
<p>Here’s another one: in theory the prefixes delegated through DHCPv6 should be static and <del>permanently</del> assigned to the customers <ins>for long periods of time</ins>.<!--more--></p>
<p class="note">Quoting from <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3633">RFC 3633</a>: <em>Even though this mechanism makes automatic renumbering easier, it is expected that prefixes have a long lifespan. During renumbering it is expected that the old and the new prefix co-exist for some time.</em> It's almost impossible to implement coexistence of old and new prefixes with today's BRAS software; the only reliable approach is to make delegated prefixes as stable as possible.</p>
<p>In practice, you never know how many of your customers will actually ask for the delegated prefix, so it might be simpler to use a local BRAS pool to serve the customers that ask for a delegated prefix out of the blue, and static RADIUS-based prefix delegation for people who actually ask for a static prefix.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Cisco IOS/IOS-XE already has a tool to do exactly that: <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/01/dhcpv6-prefix-delegation-with-radius.html">RADIUS-based DHCPv6 prefix delegation works according to RFC 4818 in recent IOS releases</a>, and you can use the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-radext-ipv6-access-13"><em>Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool</em></a><em> </em>to specify the local BRAS pool for those customers that don’t have the <em>Delegated-IPv6-Prefix </em>attribute.</p>
<p class="info">If you’re using <a href="http://freeradius.org/">freeRADIUS</a> it seems you can create a rule that would add the <em>Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool </em>to users that don’t have the <em>Delegated-IPv6-Prefix </em>attribute. Suggestion highly welcome ;)</p>
