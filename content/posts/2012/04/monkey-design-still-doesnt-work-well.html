title: Monkey Design Still Doesn’t Work Well

<p>We’ve seen several interesting data center fabric solutions during the <a href="https://techfieldday.com/2012/nfd3/">Networking Tech Field Day</a> presentations, every time hearing how the new fabric technologies (actually, the <em>shortest path bridging </em>part of those technologies) allow us to shed the yoke of the Spanning Tree monster (see <a href="http://brandonjcarroll.com/understanding-switch-fabrics-part-1/">Understanding Switch Fabrics</a> by <a href="http://brandonjcarroll.com/author/admin/">Brandon Carroll</a> for more details). Not surprisingly we wanted to know more and asked the obvious question: “and how would you connect the switches within the fabric?”<!--more--></p>
<p>The vendors were quick to assure us that “we can use any topology we want.” We also heard the buzzwords like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube">hypercube</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clos_network">Clos</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology#Daisy_chain">daisy chain</a> and ring, and the promises like “you just plug it in ... it just works!” What they usually forgot to mention was the fact that <a href="http://etherealmind.com/bisectional-bandwidth-l2mp-trill-bridges-design-value/">removing the rigid requirements of spanning tree protocol</a> doesn’t magically alleviate the need for proper network design.</p>
<p>Brandon has gracefully allowed me to use a picture from his blog post to illustrate the problem. Imagine you build a network shown in the following diagram. Because you’re using a fabric technology (be it <a href="/tag/trill/">TRILL</a>, <a href="/2010/08/trill-and-8021aq-are-like-apples-and/">SPB</a>, FabricPath or something else), no ports are blocked and you should be able to use all the bandwidth in the network ... but that simply won’t happen.</p>

<p>You see, the shortest path bridging technologies behave almost exactly like routing, and (like their name indicates) they give you <em>shortest path </em>bridging. All the traffic between A and E will still go over the B-C link because <em>that’s the shortest path</em>. The path A-B-D-C-E is longer and won’t be used.</p>
<p class="note">The B-D and C-D links would be used if there would be other devices attached to D, but I hope you get my point – shortest path bridging technologies are no better than routing.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Just because the shortest path bridging technologies provide routing-like behavior at MAC layer doesn’t mean that you can wire your network haphazardly. Fortunately, you can fall back to the age-old rules of properly designed routed networks ... and guess what: they usually prescribe a hierarchical structure with edge, aggregation and core. Maybe the shiny new world isn’t so different from the old one after all.</p>
