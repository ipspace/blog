<p>The blogosphere has been full of OpenFlow-related articles recently (no wonder - there was <a href="http://opennetsummit.org/">Open Networking Summit</a> in Santa Clara), so here's a special OpenFlow edition of interesting links</p>
<p>Let's start with my good friend <a href="http://etherealmind.com/">Greg Ferro</a>. I'm so glad to see him returning back from a sabbatical at OpenFlow Kool-Aid lake. His latest articles are a must-read: <a href="http://etherealmind.com/openflow-might-lower-capex-while-sdn-will-increase-opex/">OpenFlow might lower CapEx while SDN will increase OpEx</a> and <a href="http://etherealmind.com/openflow-doesnt-undermine-vendors-even-though-it-changes-everything/">OpenFlow doesn’t undermine Vendors even though it changes everything</a>. We're perfectly aligned, which will make our discussions way less interesting, but I'm glad I'm not the only conservative in the town.<!--more--></p>
<p><a href="http://nerdtwilight.wordpress.com/">Brad Casemore</a> replied to one of Greg's posts with <a href="http://nerdtwilight.wordpress.com/2012/04/16/debating-sdn-openflow-and-cisco-as-a-software-company/">Debating SDN, OpenFlow, and Cisco as a Software Company</a>, reiterating a well-known fact: while Cisco has the best feature set out there, they never knew how to sell software-only solutions (remember their network management products?). Bonus reading: Brad discussing ODMs in <a href="http://nerdtwilight.wordpress.com/2012/04/10/direct-from-odms-the-hardware-complement-to-sdn/">Direct from ODMs: The Hardware Complement to SDN</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jedelman.com/">Jason Edelman</a> was attending the Open Networking Summit and <a href="http://www.jedelman.com/1/archives/04-2012/1.html">wrote several interesting articles</a>, including <a href="http://www.jedelman.com/1/post/2012/04/software-defined-networking-cisco-domination-to-market-education.html">Software Defined Networking: Cisco Domination to Market Education</a> and <a href="http://www.jedelman.com/1/post/2012/04/the-evolving-sdn-ecosystem.html">The Evolving SDN Ecosystem</a>. <p>There were two really good articles on Cisco's blogs: <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/news/is-it-just-sdn/">Is it Just Software Defined Networks (SDN)?</a> by Dave Ward (back @ Cisco from a short trip to Juniper) and <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/open-networking-summit-day-1/">Open Networking Summit, Day 1</a> by Omar Sultan.<p><p>Finally, Google revealed their production SDN/OpenFlow network, triggering a bunch of industry press articles. <a href="http://gigaom.com/cloud/googles-next-openflow-challenge-taking-sdns-to-the-consumer/">Google’s next OpenFlow challenge: taking SDNs to the consumer</a> and <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/04/going-with-the-flow-google/">Going With the Flow: Google's Secret Switch to the Next Wave of Networking</a> are not bad.</p>
<p>Coming back to the "Open" Networking Summit: the only online copy of Google's SDN/OpenFlow presentations available today is <a href="https://ripe64.ripe.net/archives/video/884/">Todd Underwood's lightning talk @ RIPE64</a> given two days after ONS 2012 ended. Great job, ONS 2012!</p>
<p>And just in case you're interested in some background of all the openness being promoted this week, read a Forbes article that should become a classic: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2012/04/03/be-wary-of-geeks-bearing-gifts/">Be Wary Of Geeks Bearing Gifts</a>. Nuff said.</p>
