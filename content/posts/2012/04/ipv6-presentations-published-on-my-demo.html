<p>The system that allows me to publish slide decks on my demo site is finally ready for beta testing ... you’re most welcome to try it with different browsers and tell me how many things are broken.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=IPv6E101#PPT">already published my IPv6 presentations</a> from <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/search?q=ipv6+summit">Slovenian IPv6 summits</a>. <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=IPv6E101#PPT">Enjoy them</a> (but do remember that some of them are more than 2 years old).</p>
