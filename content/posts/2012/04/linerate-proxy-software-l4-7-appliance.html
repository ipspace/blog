title: 'LineRate Proxy: Software L4-7 Appliance With a Twist'

<p>Buying a new networking appliance (be it VPN concentrator, firewall or load balancer … aka <a href="http://packetpushers.net/show-47-load-balancers-good-thing-we-step-in-it/">Application Delivery Controller</a>) is a royal pain. You never know how much performance you’ll need in two or three years (and your favorite bean counter will not allow you to scrap it in less than 4-5 years). You do know you’ll never get the performance promised in vendor’s data sheets … but you don’t always know which combination of features will kill the box.</p>
<p>Now, imagine someone offers you a <em>performance guarantee </em>– you’ll always get what you paid for. That’s what <a href="http://lineratesystems.com/">LineRate Systems</a>, a startup just exiting stealth mode is promising.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Where’s the trick?</strong> It’s simple – they don’t sell hardware, their <a href="http://lineratesystems.com/products-solutions/">software-only appliance</a> (LineRate Proxy) runs on run-of-the-mill x86 servers. If you don’t get the performance you want (up to the licensed bandwidth), just add more servers.</p>
<p>Additional benefit: you don’t have to buy dedicate hardware – whenever you need more bandwidth, you can take another server from your compute pool and repurpose it as a networking appliance.</p>
<p><strong>Isn’t CPU-based packet processing expensive?</strong> Sure is … if you use TCP stacks written for single-core CPUs and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NE1000">NE1000 interface cards</a> in 1990’s. Like <a href="/2012/02/6wind-solving-virtual-appliance.html">6WIND</a>, LineRate Systems developed their own TCP stack that replaces the one in FreeBSD kernel. They claim their LineRate Operating System (LROS) can reach 20-40 Gbps throughput on dedicated commodity x86 hardware with built-in NICs.</p>
<p class="note">The performance numbers are good, but not exactly mind-blowing. vShield Edge can reach 4 Gbps with a single vCPU (single core) and <a href="/2011/11/junipers-virtual-gateway-virtual.html">Juniper’s Virtual Gateway can deliver up to 30 Gbps on a high-end server</a>.</p>
<p>They also claim LROS can handle 100K+ session setups per second, 2M active flows and 4000 tenants (virtual network appliances) on a single server with 24GB of RAM. Although the numbers are not too far away from what’s realistically possible, I’d still do my own tests before deploying such a configuration (and just in case you need a great traffic generator, watch <a href="http://vimeo.com/39764172">Spirent videos</a> from <a href="http://techfieldday.com/2012/nfd3/">Networking Tech Field Day</a>).</p>

<p><strong>What about SSL offload?</strong> Well, that’s where the going gets tough. You will definitely reach the performance you paid for, but you’ll have to throw a lot of CPU power at the problem compared to dedicate SSL hardware (after all, there’s a good reason we’re doing SSL offload in load balancers instead of running SSL code on web servers). Get a demo, run your own tests, do the math.</p>
<p><strong>How good is the feature set?</strong> Honestly, no idea. The list of features supported by LineRate Proxy in currently shipping release is long and includes load balancing (with server health monitoring), content switching and filtering, SSL termination, ACL/IP filters, TCP optimization, and DDoS blocking.</p>
<p>They promised to give me access to documentation; after reading it, I might be able to tell you more (or at least ask <a href="http://datacenteroverlords.com/category/load-balancing/">Tony Bourke</a> a non-trivial question). However, I do suspect there’s a reason their solution’s “<em>entry cost is </em><em>70% lower than competing HW purchase</em>”. </p>
<p class="info">We all love bashing hardware networking companies for their extravagant margins, while they’re actually hiding software development costs by not including them in costs of goods sold.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Tenant isolation. </strong>As I already mentioned, a single LineRate Proxy appliance supports multiple tenants. To do that, it has to provide isolation between tenant networks, at least on the <em>inside </em>interfaces. So far, the only virtual networking technology they support are simple VLANs. No Q-in-Q, no PBB, no MAC-over-IP.</p>
<p><strong>High availability. </strong>They claim you can configure their appliances in N+1 high-availability cluster. They use <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/carp.html">CARP</a> (<a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2090149">a FreeBSD artifact</a>) to pass outside IP addresses between the hosts.</p>
<p><strong>Other goodies?</strong> LineRate Systems got two other things right:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Contrary to some other vendors (large and small) they do acknowledge that IPv6 exists – LineRate Proxy has dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6) from day one, including load balancing between the two.</li>
<li>Like <a href="/2011/11/junos-day-one-down-rabbit-hole.html">Juniper</a>, they used the opportunity of a clean-slate approach. They implemented device configuration and provisioning the way it should be done in 2012 – the management interface is REST API (that you can tie directly to your cloud orchestration platform) with CLI and GUI being implemented as API clients.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use cases. </strong>LineRate Proxy is probably best suited to cost-sensitive environments with unpredictable traffic growth (they claim their cost-per-tenant is less than $50/year … Amazon’s Elastic Load Balancing starts @ $18/month) and basic feature requirements. IaaS and SaaS providers immediately come to mind; not surprisingly, <a href="http://photobucket.com/">photobucket.com</a> is one of their reference customers.</p>
<p><strong>Finally - w</strong><strong>hat is Software-Defined Network Services?</strong> Ah, that one? Glad you asked. You see, everything has to be hitched to the SDN train these days or you don’t get VC funding. A creative marketer could call any load balancer with an API SDNS, but between us – just because you have a software-only product that happens to have an API doesn’t mean that you just created a whole new category of solutions.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>LineRate Proxy seems to be an interesting product worth testing, primarily due to their no-nonsense licensing (high performance doesn’t hurt either). If you’re building your own cloud infrastructure and are willing to consider startup vendors as part of your infrastructure, give them a try.</p>
<h4>Full disclosure</h4><p>I got the information presented in this blog post during a phone call briefing with <a href="http://lineratesystems.com/author/sgeorgis/">Steve Georgis</a>, LineRate’s CEO. I was not able to test their product or read the product documentation.</p>
