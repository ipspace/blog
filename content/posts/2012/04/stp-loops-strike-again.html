<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/vasilis-bouloukos/2/a66/b69">Vasilis</a> sent me an interesting campfire story. It started with a common mistake:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">An external partner of my company used an Ethernet cable and connected two switchport interfaces of one of our access switches .</blockquote>
<p>Being a conscientious networking engineer, he had the usual safeguards in place ...<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite">I have to mention that these access ports are configured with Root, BDPU guard as well as Portfast.</blockquote>
<p>... but he nonetheless experienced a total LAN meltdown:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">This had a severe effect (unavailability) to our LAN. L2 loops caused our L2 switches, Core Switches and Routers to reach 100% CPU!</blockquote>
<p>Root cause analysis turned out a surprising fact:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I thought that BPDU and Root guard were enough to protect the access ports of our LAN but found out it was not true.</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk389/tk621/technologies_tech_note09186a0080136673.shtml">Cisco documentation explaining the problem</a> is quite explicit:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">It should be noted that short-living loops are not prevented by Root or BPDU Guards, if two portfast-enabled ports are connected directly or through the hub</blockquote>
<p><strong>The problem?</strong> Looped ports won’t shut down until a BPDU packet is sent through one of them, and a single broadcast (for example, ARP packet) sent in that interval can cause a network meltdown.</p>
<p><strong>The solution?</strong> Vasilis found a solution similar to those proposed in comments to my <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2012/01/prevent-bridging-loops-without-bpdus.html"><em>Preventing Bridging Loops Without STP</em></a> post: use <strong>switchport port-security </strong>and limit the number of MAC addresses accepted on the switch port. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this solution works primarily in campus environments; you cannot use it in virtualized data centers with moving VMs as you can never predict how many VMs (and MAC addresses) will reside within a physical server.</p>
<p><strong>Better ideas?</strong> Please share them in the comments!</p>
<p><strong>Short summary</strong>: Bridging (also known as layer-2 switching) sucks (and some implementations suck more than others). We need to move to L3-based solutions.</p>
