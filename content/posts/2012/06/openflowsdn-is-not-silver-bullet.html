<p>Last autumn Todd Hoff (the author of the fantastic <a href="http://highscalability.com/">High Scalability blog</a>) asked me to write a short article explaining the scalability challenges SDN and OpenFlow in particular might be facing. It took me “a while”, but I finally got it done – the <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/6/4/openflowsdn-is-not-a-silver-bullet-for-network-scalability.html"><em>OpenFlow/SDN Is Not a Silver Bullet </em><em>f</em><em>or Network Scalability</em></a> article was published last Monday.</p>
