<p>In case the industry press hasn’t told you yet, tomorrow is the <a href="http://www.worldipv6launch.org/">World IPv6 Launch day</a>. While the obstinate naysayers will still claim IPv6 doesn’t matter (but then there are people believing in flat Earth being ~6000 years old and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down">riding on a stack of turtles</a>), the rest of us should be prepared to enable IPv6 when needed … and it all starts with the networking equipment that supports IPv6 and has IPv6 performance that has at least the same order of magnitude as the IPv4 performance.<!--more--></p>
<p>It’s impossible to keep current with all the IPv6-related RFCs and other requirements, and requesting “equipment that supports IPv6” will enable everyone to pull wool over your eyes (including the vendors that claim to have IPv6-ready equipment). Fortunately, Jan Žorž, one of the great IPv6 evangelists started a “let’s make an official list of requirements” process a few years ago, which <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/10/do-i-need-ipv6-in-my-enterprise-again.html">resulted in RIPE-501</a> published in November 2010.</p>
<p>Jan didn’t stop there – he gathered a great team of co-authors, they spent over a year polishing RIPE-501-bis, included tons of comments from the RIPE IPv6 mailing list, and the result has just been published: <a href="http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/current-ripe-documents/ripe-554">RIPE-544</a>, a document that you can use during the equipment evaluation and in the RFP creation process. The German government did just that and <a href="https://ripe64.ripe.net/archives/video/861/">created an IPv6 profile that closely mirrors RIPE-554</a> (which was not yet available at that time).</p>
