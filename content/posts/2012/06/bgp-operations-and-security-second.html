<p>Jerome has just published the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-jdurand-bgp-security-01.txt">second version of our BGP operations and security</a> Internet draft. Most of the typos and obvious blunders have been fixed (or so we hope) and weâ€™ve incorporated numerous comments <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/03/my-first-internet-draft-has-just-been.html#comments">received online</a> or during the Paris IETF meeting. Feedback is (as always) highly welcome.</p>
<p class="update">The latest draft is <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jdurand-bgp-security-02">available here</a>.</p>
