<p>I get this question every second week or so – someone would like to buy the yearly subscription and wonders whether she’ll be able to watch the recordings on her iPad.</p>
<p>Short answer: <i>Yes for most webinars</i>.</p>
<p class="update">Update 2012-07-13: All webinars recorded prior to July 1st 2012 are available in ARF format. Many of them are also available in edited MP4 format.<!--more--></p>
<p>More precise answer: <i>It depends</i>.</p>
<p>And the long story: webinars are recorded within the WebEx system in a proprietary (ARF) format and streamed from WebEx servers. You can download the ARF file for webinars <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Recordings">recorded</a> more than a year ago and convert it to MP4 or Flash format yourself using the WebEx-provided player (Windows only).</p>
<p>I’m converting recent webinars to MP4 format and publishing them, but I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/etherealmind/statuses/144122949773950977">a bit Ivan about the results</a> and want to do a proper job and clean them up before they’re published. That takes an enormous amount of time (just spent the whole weekend working on the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/DMVPN_Designs">DMVPN Designs</a> webinar) and thus there’s usually a gap between the time the streamed recording is published (immediately after the webinar) and the time you can download it in MP4 format.</p>
<p>If you want to check which recordings I’ve already converted to MP4 format, please go to the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Materials">list of materials you get with yearly subscription</a>; some webinars have MP4 files in the list of documents.</p>
