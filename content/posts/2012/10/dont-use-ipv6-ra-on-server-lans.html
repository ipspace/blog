<p>Enabling IPv6 on a server LAN with the <strong>ipv6 address </strong>interface configuration without taking additional precautions might be a bad idea. All modern operating systems have IPv6 enabled by default, and the moment someone starts sending Router Advertisement (RA) messages, they’ll auto-configure their LAN interfaces.<!--more--></p>
<p class="warn">Autoconfigured servers <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/10/you-must-take-control-of-ipv6-in-your.html">might become exposed to the outside world</a> if you’re using something like <strong>iptables </strong>to protect them (because IPv6 uses <strong>ip6tables</strong>) – one of the many IPv6 security gotchas <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/evyncke">Eric Vyncke</a> and myself will describe in the upcoming <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6Sec">IPv6 security webinar</a> (<a href="http://ipv6security.eventbrite.com/">register here</a>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, there’s a per-prefix flag in RA messages (the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861#section-4.6.2">A flag</a> described in details in my <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/SPIPv6Core">Building Large IPv6 Service Provider Networks</a> webinar) telling the end-hosts whether they could use the prefix for stateless autoconfiguration. If you configure the routers not to advertise the A flag with something like the <strong>ipv6 nd prefix no-autoconfig </strong>interface configuration command, the hosts won’t get a valid IPv6 address and you’re safe ... or so one would think.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the reality is a bit more convoluted than that. I had a great chat with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sandersteffann">Sander Steffann</a> during RIPE65 and he was kind enough to explain the intricacies:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>The moment a Unix-like server gets an IPv6 default route through RA, it thinks it lives in a dual-stack world (even though it doesn’t have a routable IPv6 address);</li>
<li>Dual-stack-aware applications start establishing outgoing IPv6 sessions, and the server starts sending TCP SYN packets with the link-local source address, which any decent first-hop router immediately rejects with <em>destination unreachable (beyond scope of source address) </em>ICMP message.</li>
<li>Some Unix-like servers react to the ICMP message and close the half-baked TCP session, allowing the application to recover pretty quickly, others wait for TCP SYN timeouts (because a security-conscious operating system never listens to ICMP messages ... after all, they might have been spoofed). </li>
</ul>
<p>The only safe way to configure IPv6 on a server LAN where you don’t control all the servers (and thus cannot be sure IPv6 is disabled on the servers that should be IPv4-only) is thus to disable RA, use static server IPv6 addresses, static IPv6 default route configured on the servers, and first-hop redundancy protocol (like HSRP) between the first-hop layer-3 switches.</p>
