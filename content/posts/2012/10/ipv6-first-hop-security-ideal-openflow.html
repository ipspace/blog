<p>Supposedly it’s a good idea to be able to identify which one of your users had a particular IP address at the time when that source IP address created significant havoc. We have a definitive solution for the IPv4 world: DHCP server logs combined with <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750e_3560e/software/release/15.0_1_se/configuration/guide/swdhcp82.html">DHCP snooping, IP source guard</a> and <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750e_3560e/software/release/15.0_1_se/configuration/guide/swdynarp.html">dynamic ARP inspection</a>. IPv6 world is a mess: read <a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/v6ops/current/msg14389.html">this e-mail message from v6ops mailing list</a> and watch <a href="https://ripe65.ripe.net/archives/video/111/">Eric Vyncke’s RIPE65 presentation</a> for excruciating details.<!--more--></p>
<h4>Short summary</h4><ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Many layer-2 switches still lack the feature parity with IPv4;</li>
<li>IPv6 uses three address allocation algorithms (SLAAC, privacy extensions, DHCPv6) and it’s quite hard to enforce a specific one;</li>
<li>Host implementations are wildly different (aka: The nice thing about standards is that you have so many to choose from.).</li>
<li>IPv6 address tracking is a hodgepodge of kludges.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What if ... there would be an OpenFlow solution?</h4><p>Now imagine a parallel universe in which the geniuses creating OpenFlow 1.0 actually considered IPv6. IPv6 address tracking would become an ideal job for an OpenFlow controller:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Whenever a new end-host appears on the network, it’s authenticated, and its MAC address is logged. Only that MAC address can be used on that port (many switches already implement this functionality).</li>
<li>Whenever an end-host starts using a new IPv6 source address, the packets are not matched by any existing OpenFlow entries and thus get forwarded to the OpenFlow controller. </li>
<li>The OpenFlow controller decides whether the new source IPv6 is legal (enforcing DHCPv6-only address allocation if needed), logs the new IPv6-to-MAC address mapping, and modifies the flow entries in the first-hop switch. The IPv6 end-host can use many IPv6 addresses – each one of them is logged immediately.</li>
<li>Ideally, if the first-hop switches support all the nuances introduced in OpenFlow 1.2, the controller can install neighbor advertisement (NA) filters, effectively blocking ND spoofing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Will this nirvana appear anytime soon? Not likely. Most switch vendors support only OpenFlow 1.0, which is totally IPv6-ignorant (if you’re aware of OF1.2-compliant switches, please write a comment). Also, solving real-life operational issues is never as sexy as promoting the next unicorn-powered fountain of youth.  </p>
