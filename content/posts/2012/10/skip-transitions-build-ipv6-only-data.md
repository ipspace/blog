title: Skip the Transitions, Build IPv6-Only Data Centers

During last week's IPv6 Summit I presented an interesting idea first proposed by [Tore Anderson](https://twitter.com/toreanderson): let's [skip all the transition steps and implement IPv6-only data centers](https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/05/ipv6-only-data-center-built-by-tore.html).
