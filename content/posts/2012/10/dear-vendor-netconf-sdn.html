<p>Some vendors feeling the urge to SDN-wash their products claim that the ability to “program” them through NETCONF (or XMPP or whatever other similar mechanism) makes them SDN-blessed. </p>
<p>There might be a yet-to-be-discovered vendor out there that creatively uses NETCONF to change the device behavior in ways that cannot be achieved by CLI or GUI configuration, but most of them <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/06/netconf-expect-on-steroids.html">use NETCONF as a reliable Expect script</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>More precisely: what I’ve seen being done with NETCONF or XMPP is executing CLI commands or changing device (router, switch) configuration on-the-fly using a mechanism that is slightly more reliable than a Perl script doing the same thing over an SSH session. Functionally it’s the same thing as typing the exec-level or configuration commands manually (only a bit faster and with no auto-correct).</p>
<p>What's missing? Few examples: you cannot change the device behavior beyond the parameters already programmed in its operating system (like you could with <a href="https://devcentral.f5.com/tabid/1082202/Default.aspx">iRules on F5 BIG-IP</a>). You cannot implement new functionality (apart from trivial things like configuring and removing static routes or packet/route filters). And yet some $vendors I respect call that SDN. Give me a break, I know you can do better than that.</p>
