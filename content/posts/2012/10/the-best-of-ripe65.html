title: The best of RIPE65

<p>Last week I had the privilege of attending RIPE65, meeting a bunch of extremely bright SP engineers, and listening to a few fantastic presentations (<a href="https://ripe65.ripe.net/programme/report/">full meeting report</a> @ <a href="https://ripe65.ripe.net/">RIPE65 web site</a>).</p>
<p>I knew <a href="http://www.potaroo.net/">Geoff Huston</a> would have a great presentation, but his <a href="https://ripe65.ripe.net/archives/video/3">QoS presentation</a> was even better than I expected. I don’t necessarily agree with everything he said, but every vendor peddling QoS should be forced to listen to his explanation of the underlying problems and kludgy solutions first.<!--more--></p>
<p>His other presentation <a href="https://ripe65.ripe.net/archives/video/53">described (lack of) DNSSEC resolvers</a>. If nothing else, watch it for the hilarious comments he was making.</p>
<p>As expected, there was plenty of IPv6-related content: </p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Lorenzo Colliti describing the <a href="https://ripe65.ripe.net/archives/video/54/">results of the World IPv6 Launch</a> (and dirty tricks some broken service providers were using to get off the radar);</li>
<li>Eric Vyncke explaining the <a href="https://ripe65.ripe.net/archives/video/111">IPv6 layer-2 security problems and countermeasures</a>;</li>
<li>Nick Hillard having an <a href="https://ripe65.ripe.net/archives/video/138">IPv6 Real-Time Blackholing tutorial</a>;</li>
<li>Mark Townsley talking about <a href="https://ripe65.ripe.net/archives/video/5">stateless PAT</a> (yes, we do have a round square after all);</li>
<li>Andy Davidson presenting an <a href="https://ripe65.ripe.net/archives/video/118">idealistic view of why NAT64 should win</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not surprisingly, everyone describing their real-life experience in the IPv6 working group was <a href="https://ripe65.ripe.net/archives/video/88">talking about low-cost CPE problems</a>, but there’s a lot of silver lining: <a href="https://ripe65.ripe.net/archives/video/94">RIPE did a CPE survey</a> with <a href="https://labs.ripe.net/Members/mirjam/marco_hogewoning/the-2012-ipv6-cpe-survey">encouraging results</a> and Ondrej Filip from Czech NIC <a href="https://ripe65.ripe.net/archives/video/113">presented actual test results</a> available on-line in their <a href="http://katr.labs.nic.cz/">Catalogue of IPv6 routers</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we got a glimpse of an idea so secret <del>we never got the slides</del> it took more than a week to <a href="https://ripe65.ripe.net/presentations/828-RIPE65.Talk29.Google_Blackbox_Monitoring.pdf">publish the slides</a>: <a href="http://openwall.info/wiki/people/furry">Jen Linkova from Google</a> is <a href="https://ripe65.ripe.net/archives/video/51">using MPLS in a most creative way to measure the WAN network forwarding behavior</a>. That’s all I’m going to say right now – watch her presentation and figure out what she’s doing.</p>
