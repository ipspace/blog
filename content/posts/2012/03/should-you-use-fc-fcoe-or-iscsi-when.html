<p>Should you use FC, FCoE or iSCSI when deploying new gear in your existing data center? What about Greenfield deployments? What are the decision criteria? Should you just skip iSCSI and use NFS if you’re focusing on server virtualization with VMware? Does it still make sense to build separate iSCSI network? Are jumbo frames useful? We’ll try to answer all these questions and a few more in the first <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/introducing-data-center-virtual-symposiums/">Data Center Virtual Symposium</a> sponsored by Cisco Systems.<!--more--></p>
