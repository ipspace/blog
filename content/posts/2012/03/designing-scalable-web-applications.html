<p>My regular readers probably know that I’m running a 4-month course in scalable web application design at University of Ljubljana (everyone else will <a href="/2012/02/going-back-to-ivory-tower.html">find more details here</a>). I was extremely surprised when we started – I’d expected to see about a dozen students, and suddenly realized I was standing in front of a totally crowded classroom. The next amazing surprise was the students’ level of motivation, commitment, knowledge, and the quality of their questions. It’s definitely fun to have an audience like that.<!--more--></p>
<p>I promised I’d try to publish as many presentations as possible (the live recordings didn’t work out). The <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/85053211/Designing-Scalable-Web-Applications-1-Introduction">first presentation is already available on Scribd</a>; it covers introductory topics from “start with a solution for someone’s needs, not cool technology” to “what tools shall we use?”</p>
<p class="note">Please don’t get annoyed by all the ads on Scribd. They are theirs, not mine ... and they are a perfect reason why my presentations won’t stay there for long (but I have to spend some more quality coding time first).</p>
