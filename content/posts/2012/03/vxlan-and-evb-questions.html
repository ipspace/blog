title: VXLAN and EVB questions

<p>Wim (@fracske) De Smet sent me a whole set of very good <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/search?q=vxlan">VXLAN</a>- and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/search?q=evb">EVB</a>-related questions that might be relevant to a wider audience.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">If I understand you correctly, you think that VXLAN will win over EVB?</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn’t say they are competing directly from the technology perspective. There are two ways you can design your virtual networks: (a) smart core with <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/12/vmware-vswitch-baseline-of-simplicity.html">simple edge</a> (see also: voice and Frame Relay switches) or (b) smart edge with simple core (see also: Internet). EVB makes option (a) more viable, VXLAN is an early attempt at implementing option (b).<!--more--></p>
<p class="note">When discussing virtualized networks I consider the virtual switches in the hypervisors the network edge and the physical switches (including top-of-rack switches) the network core.</p>
<p>Historically, option (b) (smart edge with simple core) has been proven to scale better ... the largest example of such architecture is allowing you to read my blog posts.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Is it correct that EVB isn't implemented yet?</blockquote>
<p>Actually it is – <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/02/ibm-launched-nexus-1000v-competitor.html">IBM has just launched its own virtual switch for VMware ESX</a> (a competitor to Nexus 1000V) that has limited EVB support (the way I understand the documentation, it seems to support VDP, but not the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/05/evb-8021qbg-s-component.html">S-component</a>).</p>
<blockquote class="cite">But VXLAN has its limitations – for example, only VXLAN-enabled VMs will be able to speak to each other.</blockquote>
<p>Almost correct. VMs are not aware of VXLAN (they are thus not VXLAN-enabled). From VM NIC perspective the VM is connected to an Ethernet segment, which could be (within the vSwitch) implemented with VLANs, VXLAN, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/04/vcloud-director-networking.html">vCDNI</a>, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/09/nvgre-because-one-standard-just-wouldnt.html">NVGRE</a>, STT or something else.</p>
<p>At the moment, the only implemented VXLAN termination point is Nexus 1000v, which means that only VMs residing within ESX hosts with Nexus 1000V can communicate over VXLAN-implemented Ethernet segments. Some vendors are <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/10/vxlan-termination-on-physical-devices.html">hinting they will implement VXLAN in hardware</a> (switches), and Cisco already has the required hardware in Nexus 7000 (because <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/09/vxlan-otv-and-lisp.html">VXLAN has the same header format as OTV</a>).</p>
<blockquote class="cite">VXLAN encapsulation will also take some CPU cycles (thus impacting your VM performance.</blockquote>
<p>While VXLAN encapsulation will not impact VM performance per se, it will eat CPU cycles that could be used by VMs. If your hypervisor host has spare CPU cycles, VXLAN overhead shouldn’t matter, if you’re pushing it to the limits, you might experience performance impact.</p>
<p>However, the elephant in the room is the <a href="http://codingrelic.geekhold.com/2011/12/requiem-for-jumbo-frames.html">TCP offload</a>. It can drastically improve I/O performance (and reduce CPU overhead) of network-intensive VMs. The moment you start using VXLAN, TCP offload is gone (most physical NICs can’t insert the VXLAN header during TCP fragmentation), and the overhead of the TCP stack increases dramatically.</p>
<p>If your VMs are CPU-bound you might not notice; if they generate lots of user-facing data, lack of TCP offload might be a killer.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I personally see VXLAN as a end to end solution where we can't interact on the network infrastructure anymore. For example, how would these VMs be able to connect to the first-hop gateway?</blockquote>
<p>Today you can use VXLAN to implement “closed” virtual segments that can interact with the outside world only through VMs with multiple NICs (a VXLAN-backed NIC and a VLAN-backed NIC), which makes it perfect for environments where firewalls and load balancers are implemented with VMs (example: VMware’s vCloud with vShield Edge and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/11/junipers-virtual-gateway-virtual.html">vShield App</a>). As said above, VXLAN termination points might appear in physical switches. </p>
<blockquote class="cite">With EVB we would still have full control and could do the same things we’re doing today on the network infrastructure, and the network will be able to automatically provide the correct VLAN's on the correct ports.</blockquote>
<p>That’s a perfect summary. EVB enhances today’s VLAN-backed virtual networking infrastructure, while VXLAN/vCDNI/NVGRE/STT completely change the landscape.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Is then the only advantage of VXLAN that you can scale better because you don't have the VLAN limitation?</blockquote>
<p>VXLAN and other MAC-over-IP solutions have two advantages: they allow you to break through the VLAN barrier (but so do vCDNI, Q-in-Q or Provider Backbone Bridging), but <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/12/decouple-virtual-networking-from.html">they also scale better because the core network uses routing</a>, not bridging. With MAC-over-IP solutions you don’t need novel L2 technologies (like TRILL, FabricPath, VCS Fabric or SPB), because they run over IP core that can be built with existing equipment using well-known (and well-tested) designs.</p>
