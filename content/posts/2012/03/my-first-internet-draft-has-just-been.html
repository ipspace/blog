<p>While I was discussing the intricacies of Cisco’s IPv6 implementation with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/gunter-van-de-velde/0/936/7a5">Gunter Van de Velde</a> a while ago, he suddenly changed hats and asked me whether I would be willing to contribute to a BGP filtering best practices draft. I’m still too young to realize it’s not a good idea to say YES every time you see something interesting and immediately accepted the challenge.<!--more--></p>
<p>Gunter put together a fantastic team including <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jerome-durand/6/663/395">Jerome Durand</a> and Gert Doering and the first results of our work (where Jerome did most of the heavy lifting) have been published last night … I proudly present you the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jdurand-bgp-security-02">BGP operations and security</a> draft. Comments, corrections and additions are most welcome! </p>
<p class="update">2012-09-21: Changed the link to point to the latest draft.</p>
