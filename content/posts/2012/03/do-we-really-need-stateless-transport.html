title: Do we really need Stateless Transport Tunneling (STT)
url: /2012/03/do-we-really-need-stateless-transport/
---

<p>The first question everyone asked after Nicira had published <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-davie-stt-01">yet another MAC-over-IP tunneling</a> draft was probably “do we really need yet another encapsulation scheme? Aren’t <a href="/2011/08/finally-mac-over-ip-based-vcloud/">VXLAN</a> or <a href="/2011/09/nvgre-because-one-standard-just-wouldnt/">NVGRE</a> enough?” Bruce Davie <a href="http://nicira.com/blog/opening-the-tunnels">tried to answer that question</a> in his blog post (and <a href="http://networkheresy.wordpress.com/2012/03/04/network-virtualization-encapsulation-and-stateless-tcp-transport-stt/">provided more details in another one</a>), and I’ll try to make the answer a bit more graphical.<!--more--></p>
<p>The three drafts (VXLAN, NVGRE and STT) have the same goal: provide emulated layer-2 Ethernet networks over scalable IP infrastructure. The main difference between them is the encapsulation format and their approach to the control plane:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>VXLAN ignores the control plane problem and relies on flooding emulated with IP multicast;</li>
<li>NVGRE authors handwave over the control plane issue (“the way to obtain [MAC-to-IP mapping] information is not covered in this document”);</li>
<li>STT authors claim the draft describes just the encapsulation format.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything else being equal, why does STT make sense at all? The answer lies in the capabilities of modern server NICs.</p>
<h4>TCP Segmentation Offload</h4><p>Applications using TCP (for example, a web server) are not aware of the intricacies of TCP (window size, maximum segment size, retransmissions) and perceive a TCP connection as a reliable byte stream. Applications send streams of bytes to an open socket and the operating system’s TCP/IP stack slices and dices the data into individual TCP+IP packets, prepends MAC header (built from the ARP cache) in front of the IP header, and sends the L2 frames to the Network Interface Card (NIC) for transmission.</p>

<p>Modern NICs allow the TCP stacks to offload some of the heavy lifting to the hardware – most commonly the segmentation and reassembly (retransmissions are still performed in software). A TCP stack using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_segment_offload">Large Segment Offload (LSO)</a>-capable NIC would send a single jumbo MAC frame to the NIC and the NIC would slice it into properly sized TCP segments (increasing byte counts and computing IP+TCP checksums while doing that).</p>

<p>LSO significantly increases the TCP performance. If you don’t believe me (and you shouldn’t), run <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/iperf/">iperf</a> tests on your server with TCP offload turned on and off (and report your results in a comment).</p>
<h4>MAC-over-IP kills TCP offload</h4><p>Typical NICs can segment TCP-IP-MAC frames. They cannot segment TCP-IP-MAC-VXLAN-UDP-IP-MAC frames (or TCP-IP-MAC-NVGRE-IP-MAC frames). Sending L2 frames over VXLAN or NVGRE incapacitates TCP offload on most server NICs available today (I didn’t want to write <em>all</em> – if you’re aware of a NIC that could actually handle IP-over-MAC-over-GRE encapsulation, please write a comment). Does that matter? Do the tests I suggested in the previous paragraph to figure out whether it matters to you.</p>
<h4>STT – a clever TCP offload hack</h4><p>STT uses a header that looks just like the TCP header to the NIC. The NIC is thus able to perform Large Segment Offload on what it thinks is a TCP datagram.</p>
<p>The reality behind the scenes is a bit more complex: what gets handled to the NIC is an oversized TCP-IP-MAC frame (up to 64K long) with STT-IP-MAC header. The “TCP” segments produced by the NIC are thus not the actual TCP segments, but segments of STT frame passed to the NIC.</p>

<h4>Why do we have three different standards</h4><p>Here’s my cynical view: every single vendor launching a MAC-over-IP encapsulation scheme tried to make its life easy. Cisco already has VXLAN-capable hardware (VXLAN header format is similar to OTV and LISP), you can probably figure out who has GRE-capable hardware by going through the list of <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sridharan-virtualization-nvgre-00">NVGRE draft</a> authors, and Nicira focused on what they see as the most important piece of the puzzle – the performance of the servers where the VMs are running.</p>
<p>Randy Bush called this <a href="http://archive.psg.com/051000.sigcomm-ivtf.pdf">approach to standard development</a> “throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks”, which is definitely an amusing pastime … unless you happen to be the wall.</p>
