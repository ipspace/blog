<p>A friendly offer to write a guest blog post for my blog just landed in my Inbox. It's amazing what some people think networking engineers really need.<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite"><p>I came across your blog a few weeks ago as while conducting research for a website that I contribute to. The website aims to look at the progressive areas of early childhood psychology. The idea was originally to create an objective collection of resources for people interested in psychology but it has since grown into something much wider. Today, the project looks at important factors in childhood development that pay dividends in the future.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">I think a guest blog post that illuminates the the advancement of our understanding of childhood development would be interesting for your audience. If you're interested, I would love to write something for you and perhaps start a friendly dialogue. What do you think?</p>

<p>Priceless, don't you think?</p>
