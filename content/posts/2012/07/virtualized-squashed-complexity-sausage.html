<p>Straight from <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6670#section-3.4">RFC 6670 (section 3.4)</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">[...] as is usually the case with communications technologies, simplification in one element of the system introduces an increase (possibly a non-linear one) in complexity elsewhere. This creates the "squashed sausage" effect, where reduction in complexity at one place leads to significant increase in complexity at a remote location.</blockquote>
<p>This is probably the most concise description of the great idea of using <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/09/long-distance-vmotion-for-disaster.html">long-distance vMotion</a> for <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/02/what-exactly-makes-something-mission.html">“mission-critical” craplications</a>, and applies equally well to the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/12/vm-aware-networking-improves-iaas-cloud.html">kludges</a> used to compensate the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/12/vmware-vswitch-baseline-of-simplicity.html">simplicity of virtual switches</a>.</p>
