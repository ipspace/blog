<p>Straight from the rumor mill (<a href="http://go6.si/2012/07/siripe-regija-naj-bi-ez-15-dni-ostala-brez-ipv4-naslovov/">source</a>, <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fgo6.si%2F2012%2F07%2Fsiripe-regija-naj-bi-ez-15-dni-ostala-brez-ipv4-naslovov%2F">translated</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="cite">One of German ISPs is actually quite busy rolling out IPv6 after their CFO got a call from a stock analyst right during the RIPE meeting, asking questions “so what are your IPv6 plans?” – “none, what is IPv6?” – “oh, this is not so good”… full panic down the management chain…</blockquote>
<p>Proves the everlasting wisdom from Martin Levy (<a href="http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/14517199">source</a>, the rest of article is not worth reading):</p>
<blockquote class="cite">You can either do a planned, careful migration, or you can do it in a panic. And you should know full well that panicking is more expensive.</blockquote>
