title: Does CCIE still make sense?

<p>A reader of my blog sent me this question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I am a Telecommunication Engineer currently preparing for the CCIE exam. Do you think that in a near future it will be worth to be a CCIE, due to the recent developments like Nicira? What will be the future of Cisco IOS, and protocols like OSPF or BGP? I am totally disoriented about my career.</blockquote>
<p>Well, although I wholeheartedly agree with <a href="http://packetpushers.net/network-interrupted/">recent post from Derick Winkworth</a>, the sky is not falling (yet):<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Derick, Amazon and Google are years ahead of (almost) everyone else.</li>
<li>Technology changes are never abrupt. It took SNA decades to die (and it’s still kicking).</li>
<li>TCP/IP will not disappear in the foreseeable future. One would hope to see IPv4 disappear, but even there I’m not an optimist.</li>
<li>Nicira NVP is a point solution for huge IaaS clouds. It will be years before something similar will take hold in mid-range data centers. Most of them don’t need more than what VLANs offer today.</li>
<li>Data centers are not the only environment where we need networking (although they are the fastest evolving one).</li>
<li>CCIE gives you a lot of knowledge you’ll need in the future – regardless of whether you’ll be configuring routers or virtual appliances from Cisco, Juniper, Vyatta or someone else. The same applies to firewalls, load balancers etc.</li>
<li>The never-ending layers of abstractions, facades and glass panes don’t make the technology less complex – they’re just hiding the exploding complexity and zillions of hastily thrown together moving parts. Someone will have great fun fixing the whole enchilada once it breaks down (and you can’t reformat a network like a laptop).</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, do remember that networking is just plumbing – it works best when you don’t know it’s there – and CCIE, while indubitably being the most prestigious certification in this space, is no longer <a href="http://www.bradreese.com/blog/how-the-cisco-ccie-program-was-born.htm">The Top Gun</a> it was when it was introduced.</p>
<p>To summarize: Go for your CCIE, but focus on <a href="/2008/12/random-scenic-route-certification.html">knowledge not typing skills</a> and memorized configuration commands ... and never expect your CCIE certification to be a final step to a lifelong nirvana. If you decide to work in a data center environment, you’ll have to learn a lot more about virtualization, servers, storage, and emerging technologies – but that’s what makes it so much fun. </p>
<p>Finally a snarky thought on the OpenFlow versus OSPF/BGP conundrum. Although the OpenFlow pundits like to tell us how OSPF, BGP, and the rest of the protocols we use today are broken (and I somewhat agree with their “<em>having a separate protocol for each problem is stupid</em>” mantra – I would just use BGP+MPLS :D ), we’ve seen wide-area systems with centralized management and control planes before – they were called SDH, Frame Relay and ATM networks. Do I have to say more?</p>
