<p>One of my readers sent me the following question:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">I know that if I purchase a single webinar, I can apply that cost toward a yearly subscription. Is it additive? If I start buying recordings one-by-one until I reach $200, will I be given the yearly subscription?</blockquote>
<p>The answer is a qualified yes (and you can <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Upgrade">find all the details on my web site</a>):<!--more--></p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Everything you purchased in the last 3 months counts toward your yearly subscription;</li>
<li>You still have to buy it (and pay the difference) through Google Checkout.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, and if you actually bought more than $200 worth of recordings/webinars in 3 months, just send me an e-mail and Iâ€™ll create the necessary database entries manually ... I don't want to guess what would happen if you try to buy goods with negative price tags through Google Checkout.</p>
