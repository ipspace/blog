<p>My <a href="http://dmvpndg.eventbrite.com/">next live webinar</a> will be based on the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/search?q=dmvpn+design">DMVPN design posts I wrote recently</a> and a number of scenarios that landed in my Inbox during the last few months. I’ll try to help you decide which phase of the DMVPN technology to use, which routing protocol would be best for you, and how to optimize the routing protocol you select. We’ll also discuss interesting redundancy and primary/backup scenarios, including combinations of DMVPN, MPLS/VPN and 3G networks.</p>
