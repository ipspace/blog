title: Edge Virtual Bridging (802.1Qbg) – a technology refusing to die
url: /2012/02/edge-virtual-bridging-8021qbg.html
---

<p>I thought Edge Virtual Bridging (EVB) would be the technology transforming the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/12/vm-aware-networking-improves-iaas-cloud.html">kludgy vendor-specific VM-aware networking solutions</a> into a properly designed architecture, but the launch of L2-over-IP solutions for VMware and Xen hypervisors is making EVB obsolete before it ever made it through the IEEE doors.<!--more--></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1bg.html">IEEE WG is still working on the draft</a>; the major hypervisor vendors have already moved on – VMware has VXLAN, Microsoft has NVGRE and Xen/KVM have GRE+OpenFlow with Open vSwitch. As I predicted, the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/08/imagine-ruckus-when-hypervisor-vendors.html">hypervisor vendors woke up</a>, realized <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/12/decouple-virtual-networking-from.html">VLANs really don’t scale</a> (there were a few <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/12/it-oldtimers-aka-gurus-from-ivory.html">old-school idiots</a> yelling that message from <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/07/extremely-off-topic-another-recognition.html">L3 ivory towers</a> for the last few years, but nobody listened), and focused on implementing larger-scale virtualized networks with MAC-over-IP encapsulation.</p>
<p class="info">The truly sad part is that EVB isn’t a bad technology. It’s a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/05/edge-virtual-bridging-evb-8021qbg-eases.html">perfect solution if you want to use VLANs to create virtual networks</a>, and its <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/05/evb-8021qbg-s-component.html">S-component nicely solved the problem of virtual server-to-switch links</a> that we need in some environments.</p>
<p>And then there’s IBM: Its <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/02/ibm-launched-nexus-1000v-competitor.html">DVS 5000V is the first virtual switch supporting EVB/VEPA</a>, as does its <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg3T7000496">Virtual Fabric 10G switch module</a>. It’s nice to see someone using standard technologies instead of proprietary solutions like Cisco’s VN-Tag or HP’s Virtual Connect (although IBM’s documentation indicates they might have implemented a 2 year old draft). According to <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg3T7000496">the same documentation</a>, the current EVB implementation in Virtual Fabric 10G switch module doesn’t support CDCP (a standard way of creating multiple NICs over the same uplink). A year ago I would have been excited; today I can’t help being reminded of <a href="http://books.google.si/books?id=LhcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=ATM+support+IBM+FEP&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gy1pGmGO6d&amp;sig=2pGQEqdL2sv-8Iawc4yRfxZAmo4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MQpLT4a-CoLU0QXS9IH9DQ&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ATM%20support%20IBM%20FEP&amp;f=false">ATM support on IBM Front End Processors</a>.</p>
<p>Anyhow, here’s <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/bin/watch?id=a7fcf884-3b74-11e1-96be-005056880254">what I had to say about EVB</a> when I was still hoping it would become a viable technology (taken from the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Virtualized_Networking">Introduction to Virtualized Networking</a> webinar). Enjoy!</p>
