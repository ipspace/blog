<p>Three days ago <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=AN&amp;subtype=CA&amp;htmlfid=897/ENUS212-052&amp;appname=USN">IBM launched Distributed Virtual Switch 5000V</a>, its own distributed vSwitch for VMware ESX platform. On one hand, it proves Cisco has been going the right way with <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/06/what-exactly-is-nexus-1000v.html">Nexus 1000V</a> (just in case you wondered), on the other hand, things just got way more interesting – IBM is obviously returning to networking.<!--more--></p>
<p>The feature list of the DVS 5000V is not impressive (bonus point: <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/01/vmware-vswitch-does-not-support-lacp.html">unlike vSwitch</a> it does include LACP), and it sure looks like a me-too product, until you come to <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/05/edge-virtual-bridging-evb-8021qbg-eases.html">EVB support</a>. Not having anything to lose by implementing standards favored by other vendors, IBM jumped head-on into technology that <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/12/vm-aware-networking-improves-iaas-cloud.html">makes the most sense if you believe VLANs are the way to go</a> when implementing virtual networks.</p>
<p class="info">IBM already has <a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/lnxinfo/v3r0m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fliaai%2Fvswitch%2Fliaaivmswitchstart.htm">EVB/VEPA support for KVM</a>.</p>
<p>You still need two to tango – EVB support in the hypervisor doesn’t buy you anything unless it’s also implemented in the adjacent switch, and it’s not clear yet which ToR switch you could use. <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/04/new-data-center-switches-from-force10.html">Force10 announced EVB support</a> way before they were bought by Dell and hasn’t delivered yet, <a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bc/docs/support/SupportManual/c02044591/c02044591.pdf">HP is promising EVB for years</a> (with no visible results, although <a href="http://h17007.www1.hp.com/docs/whatsnew/durban/4AA3-8996ENW.pdf">HP 5900 is supposedly <em>VEPA-ready</em></a>), and I couldn’t find anything EVB-related in the <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/x/options/networking/bnt8264/specs.html">specs for IBM’s BNT switches</a>.</p>
<p>There might be an interesting twist in this story. You don’t have to implement EVB in the ToR switches if you’re using OpenFlow. EVB is a control-plane-only protocol and thus a perfect fit for a software module in an OpenFlow controller. We know <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/36566.wss">IBM and NEC are working together</a> on proving <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/11/openflow-enterprise-use-cases.html">OpenFlow is ready for enterprise networks</a>... looks like we have a few very interesting years ahead of us. </p>
