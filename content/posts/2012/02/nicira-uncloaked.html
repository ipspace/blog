<p>Nicira, the OpenFlow startup behind the Open vSwitch, has finally <a href="http://gigaom.com/cloud/meet-nicira-yes-people-will-call-it-the-vmware-of-networking/">dropped the stealthy cloak</a>. Congratulations!!! Their <a href="http://www.nicira.com/">web site</a> is still pretty sparse on details, but you can get an initial impression of what they’re doing from a number of white papers describing <a href="http://www.nicira.com/en/network-virtualization-platform">Network Virtualization Platform</a> and <a href="http://www.nicira.com/en/dvni-architecture">DVNI architecture</a>. Short summary: <a href="/2011/10/what-is-nicira-really-up-to/">I was almost right</a>, but being a routing-and-switching bloke missed a few interesting bits – <a href="/2011/12/vxlan-ip-multicast-openflow-and-control/">OpenFlow (and Open vSwitch)</a> can <a href="/2011/11/openflow-enterprise-use-cases/">easily combine security and forwarding functionality</a>.<!--more--></p>

<p>Does it matter to you? It depends on what you’re doing. If you have only a few hundred servers, <a href="/2011/12/which-virtual-networking-technology/">you’ll do just fine with VLANs</a>. NVP/OpenvSwitch combo with <a href="/2012/02/forwarding-state-abstraction-with/">L2/L3-over-IP tunneling</a> is <a href="/2011/12/decouple-virtual-networking-from/">ideal for very large data centers building IaaS infrastructure</a> with Linux-based servers (Xen/KVM/OpenStack). They do mention ESX in their <a href="http://nicira.com/en/network-virtualization-platform">NVP architecture diagram</a>, but unless they used the same API as Nexus 1000V (which would be really cool ... and somewhat improbable), Open vSwitch on ESX would be a total kludge.</p>
<p class="update">2012-02-06 10:00 GMT - based on a presentation one of my readers shared with me (thank you!), it looks like Open vSwitch on ESX (actually <em>NVP OVS Appliance</em>) uses very interesting properties of statically bound distributed ports on vDS switches. All the VM traffic has to pass through the OVS Appliance, so don't expect more than a few Gbps of throughput (the setup is similar to <a href="/2011/11/junipers-virtual-gateway-virtual/">a dvFilter-based firewall operating in slow path</a>), but it's definitely a cool trick.</p>

<p>On the <em>Virtual or Physical Appliance </em>side of the same diagram, you’ll probably notice they rely on Open vSwitch running in that appliance (because they <a href="/2012/02/virtual-circuits-in-openflow-10-world/">need their proprietary extensions and/or OVSDB to get it all working</a> – OpenFlow 1.0 is simply not rich enough). Start googling for vendors implementing OpenFlow with Open vSwitch to get the whole picture: <a href="https://developer.juniper.net/content/dam/jdn/Programmable%20Networks/OpenFLow_APP_JDN_Overview.pdf">here’s an interesting one</a>.
