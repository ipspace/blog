title: Change in OSPF Designated Router Creates Extra Network LSAs
url: /2012/12/change-in-ospf-designated-router/
---
When testing the OSPF graceful shutdown feature, I've encountered an interesting OSPF feature: if you force a change in LAN DR router (other than rebooting the current DR), you'll end up with two network LSAs describing the same LAN.

For example, if you force the B2 router in the following network to relinquish its DR status (by setting **ip ospf priority 0** on the interface), B1 will take over and generate another network LSA (as expected), but the network LSA generated by B2 will stay in the database for a while and both routers will claim they are connected to both network LSAs.

Here are the corresponding show printouts. First, the network LSAs before the change:

``` code
b2#show ip ospf 1 database | begin Net Link
Net Link States (Area 0)

Link ID ADV Router Age Seq# Checksum
10.0.0.6 172.16.0.12 283 0x80000001 0x007E52
192.168.0.6 172.16.0.22 280 0x80000001 0x00044F
```

Next, the network LSA generated by B2:

``` code
b2#show ip ospf 1 database network 192.168.0.6

OSPF Router with ID (172.16.0.22) (Process ID 1)

Net Link States (Area 0)

Routing Bit Set on this LSA
LS age: 284
Options: (No TOS-capability, DC)
LS Type: Network Links
Link State ID: 192.168.0.6 (address of Designated Router)
Advertising Router: 172.16.0.22
LS Seq Number: 80000001
Checksum: 0x44F
Length: 32
Network Mask: 255.255.255.0
Attached Router: 172.16.0.22
Attached Router: 172.16.0.21
```

After the change, there is an extra network LSA in the database issued by B1:

``` code
b2#show ip ospf 1 database | begin Net Link
Net Link States (Area 0)

Link ID ADV Router Age Seq# Checksum
10.0.0.6 172.16.0.12 324 0x80000001 0x007E52
192.168.0.5 172.16.0.21 7 0x80000001 0x00183D
192.168.0.6 172.16.0.22 321 0x80000001 0x00044F
```

And, interestingly, both B1 and B2 claim they are connected to both network LSAs:

``` code
b2#show ip ospf 1 database router 172.16.0.21

OSPF Router with ID (172.16.0.22) (Process ID 1)
