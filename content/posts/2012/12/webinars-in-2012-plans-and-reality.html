<p>A year ago I <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/01/webinars-in-2012-survey-results.html">asked you to help me plan this year’s webinars</a>. Let’s see how well I matched those expectations:<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>#1 – IPv6 access networks update</strong>. Done.</p>
<p><strong>#2 – Data Center and Virtual Networking Security</strong>. Missed. I wrote several blog posts about this topic, mentioned individual products and components in various webinars (example: <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Cloud_Computing_Networking">Cloud Computing Networking</a> and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Introduction_to_Virtualized_Networking">Introduction to Virtual Networking</a>) and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Presentations">public presentations</a>, but still don’t have a comprehensive webinar on this topic.</p>
<p><strong>#3 – Metro Ethernet and VPLS</strong>. Shelved. Although there was high interest during the survey, I got zero questions on this topic throughout the year; can’t explain the difference between survey results and follow-up reality. Any ideas?</p>
<p><strong>#4 – vSphere </strong><strong>5.0 </strong><strong>Networking Update</strong>. Postponed. vSphere 5.1 update is planned for spring 2013 ... and it’s a good thing I waited; 5.1 and the new vCNS is way sexier than 5.0 was.</p>
<p><strong>#5 – NAT64 and DNS64</strong>. Close miss. Instead of focusing on a single migration technology, the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_Transition_Mechanisms">IPv6 Transition Mechanisms</a> webinar in January 2012 covers a bunch of them.</p>
<p>Interestingly, my track record is way better for <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/files/Webinars_2012P.pdf">topics ranking between #6 and #8</a>: there were <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics_Update">Data Center Fabrics update</a>, <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/VXLAN_Technical_Deep_Dive">VXLAN virtual networking</a>, and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Clos_fabrics_explained">Clos Fabrics</a> webinars in 2012.</p>
