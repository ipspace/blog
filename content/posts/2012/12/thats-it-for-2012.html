<p>12 months and ~210 blog posts later, it’s time for yet another “That’s It” blog post. Another exciting year has <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/723.html">swooshed by</a>, and I’d like to thank you all for the insightful comments you made, the great questions you asked, and the wonderful challenges you keep sending me.</p>
<p>If at all possible, now’s the time to start shutting down the pagers and smartphones, and enjoy the simpler (and less stressful) life with the loved ones. Have a great holiday season and all the best in the coming year! I’m going offline ... right now ;)</p>
