<p>When I’m asking the yearly subscribers whether they’d like to renew their subscription, I promise them new content every 2-3 months (4-6 new sessions per year). 2012 was definitely a good year in that respect. </p>
<p>It started with the access network part of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Large_IPv6_Service_Provider_Networks">large-scale IPv6 design and deployment</a> webinar, then there were two <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics_Update">Data Center Fabrics update sessions</a> (in May and November), scalability part of the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Cloud_Computing_Networking">cloud computing networking</a> webinar, and a <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/DMVPN_Designs">DMVPN design</a> session.<!--more--></p>
<p>However, the best part of the year (at least for me) was autumn with three webinars with fantastic guest speakers: Brad Hedlund (Dell Force10, now Nicira/VMware) in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Clos_fabrics_explained">Clos Fabrics</a> webinar, Eric Vyncke (Cisco) in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_security">IPv6 Security</a> webinar and Mark Berly (Arista) in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/VXLAN_Technical_Deep_Dive">VXLAN Technical Deep Dive</a> webinar.</p>
<p>In December, I got sick-and-tired of PollDaddy’s lack of survey API, and migrated the webinar evaluation forms and all data collected during the last three years to my own web site (including a brand-new MongoDB back-end). Finally you can see the webinar evaluation results in real time. Here’s the 2012 statistics (<a href="http://cms.ipspace.net/bin/surveyResults?year=2012">live link</a>), links to statistics for individual webinar sessions will appear in a few weeks (the script displaying the survey results is ready, now I have to insert the proper links throughout the web pages).</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like to thank all my students – for having trust in my webinars, making the live sessions more interesting with fantastic questions, and keeping me straight and honest by pointing out every stupidity mere moments after I made it. Thank you and all the best in 2013!</p>
