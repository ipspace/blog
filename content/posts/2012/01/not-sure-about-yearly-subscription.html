title: Not sure about the yearly subscription? Start slowly!

<p>One of my Twitter friends sent me this question: “<em>Would you honestly recommend your webinar subscription for a young CCIE that knows how routing works but have no real world experience and is a noob in DC/VM/NXOS?</em>” That sounds like a perfect audience to me – I usually assume the attendees have mastered the fundamentals of networking/routing but don’t know much about the topics of the webinar (the whole idea of my webinars is to help you get started in new technology areas).<!--more--></p>
<p>Furthermore, I try to create <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Webinars">webinars with different prerequisite requirements</a> in <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Roadmap">each area I’m focusing on</a>. Some of the webinars are <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Category:Basic"><em>introductory</em></a><em> </em>and assume just the baseline networking knowledge, others are <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Category:Intermediate"><em>intermediate</em></a><em> </em>(where I would expect CCNP-level understanding of routing and switching), or <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Category:Advanced"><em>advanced</em></a><em> ... </em>and you can always watch them in sequence according to the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Roadmap">roadmaps</a> to slowly build your knowledge.</p>
<p>Still not sure? Take baby steps:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Start with the <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/bin/start">demo videos</a> (highly recommended if you’re not sure you’d be able to understand my English);</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Recordings">Buy one of the recordings</a> based on what you’re assuming your knowledge level is. For example: if you think you know nothing about virtualization, start with the <em>Introduction to Virtual Networking</em>.</li>
<li>If you like the recording, you can always <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Upgrade">upgrade to the yearly subscription</a> – you’ll only pay the difference.</li>
</ul>
