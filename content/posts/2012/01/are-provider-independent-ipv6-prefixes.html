<p>Aleksej sent me an intriguing question: “<em>Can the /48 PI block that a global company is assigned be attached to any region, or it is region-specific?</em>”, or, more specifically:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Imagine a company with major DC with public services in EMEA. Centralized internet break-out in Europe fails and this DC must be reachable from Asia or America - but with the same IPv6 address? That would require Asia or America's ISPs to accept injection of this same subnet in their region. Do they do that?</blockquote>
<p>In theory, the answer is <em>yes</em>. In practice, some global organizations are hedging their bets.<!--more--></p>
<p>A PI IPv6 prefix should be just that – a range of globally unique IPv6 address space that could be advertised from anywhere and should be accepted (and routed to) everywhere. A minimum globally routable IPv6 prefix length is a /48 and that’s how much PI address space you get if you don’t ask for more. <p class="info">Hint: If you have more than one location, you need more than a /48. If you have more than a few locations, always ask for <del class="wrong">at least /32</del> <ins class="corr">the largest prefix you can get (see the comment by nosx)</ins>.</p>
<p>Today, a PI IPv6 prefix is (usually) globally routable (but nobody could guarantee you that). Even more, PA prefixes not longer than /48 <em>should</em> be globally routable, but they’re not – at least the <a href="https://labs.ripe.net/Members/dbayer/visibility-of-prefix-lengths">latest measurements from RIPE labs</a> indicate some providers still use PA-specific route advertisement filters.</p>
<p>However, once mid-size organizations start migrating to IPv6, they’ll <a href="http://etherealmind.com/importance-provider-independent-ipv6-addresses/">start asking for PI address space</a> (because it’s too much hassle to renumber the internal network ... and because everyone is telling them NAT stinks). Likewise, at least some customers <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Small_site_multihoming">using poor man’s multihoming</a> will start applying for PI prefixes (unless we admit <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/12/we-just-might-need-nat66.html">we need NPT66</a> and someone actually implements it). End result: explosion in global BGP tables and forwarding tables (unless LISP gets implemented everywhere), that just might force some ISPs to implement geo-aggregation or region-based filters.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> if you’re a global organization with data centers spread across multiple RIR regions, apply for PI address space in every region where you need mission-critical connectivity.</p>
