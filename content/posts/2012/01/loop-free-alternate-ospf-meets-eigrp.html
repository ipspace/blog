<p>Assume we have a simple triangular network:</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/2012/01/s1600-LFA_Topology.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="134" src="/2012/01/s400-LFA_Topology.png" width="303"/></a></div>
<p>Now imagine the A-to-C link fails. How will OSPF react to the link failure as compared to EIGRP? Which one will converge faster? Try to answer the questions before pressing the <em>Read more </em>link ;)<!--more--></p>
<h4>EIGRP: Feasible successors</h4><p>EIGRP tries to use <em>feasible successors </em>to speed up the convergence process. Whenever B reports its distance to X to A, A compares B’s <em>reported distance </em>to its current <em>feasibility distance</em>. Lower <em>reported distance </em>means that B doesn’t use A to get to X (A is not B's successor). B is also not A's successor for X (that’s C as long as the A-to-C link is operational), but it’s a <em>feasible successor</em>. Using B to get traffic to X will not result in a routing loop.</p>
<p class="note">A <em>feasible successor</em> is evaluated for individual destinations. From A’s perspective, B is a feasible successor for X and C is a feasible successor for Y. </p>
<p>Faced with A-to-C link loss, A can switch immediately to the <em>feasible successor </em>(B) for destination X. Convergence is immediate.</p>

<h4>OSPF: Let’s make sure we’re in sync</h4><p>OSPF is way more lackadaisical:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>It changes the LSAs affected by the updates and floods them ... unless there’s been a recent topology change, in which case it goes and sits quietly in a corner until the <strong>timers throttle lsa </strong><em>hold-interval </em>expires.</li>
<li>It waits a bit more, silently lamenting its misery, until the <strong>timers throttle spf </strong><em>spf-start </em>timer expires.</li>
<li>It runs SPF algorithm, computes the new OSPF shortest-path tree, and copies the results in the IP routing table.</li>
</ul>
<p>Total convergence time: 5+ seconds (unless you’ve done some serious tweaking).</p>
<h4>Loop-Free Alternate Fast Reroute: Feasible Successor for OSPF</h4><p>There’s no reason OSPF couldn’t have reacted faster – every single router knows the whole topology of all attached areas and can thus easily calculate which of its neighbors could be feasible successors. That’s exactly what LFA is doing:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>OSPF (or IS-IS) routing process runs SPF, computes its own best paths, and installs them in the IP routing table (RIB). </li>
<li>After the network has converged, OSPF runs SPF algorithm from the perspective of its neighbors. If a neighbor’s SPF tree doesn’t use current router as the next hop for a specific destination, it’s safe to use that neighbor as a feasible successor.</li>
<li>The feasible successor information calculated by OSPF is downloaded in RIB and FIB, where it can be used immediately after the link failure.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Can I use it?</h4><p>Loop Free Alternate Fast Reroute is available for <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_ospf/configuration/xe-3s/iro-lfa-frr-xe.html">OSPF</a> and <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/iproute_isis/configuration/guide/irs_ipv4_lfafrr.pdf">IS-IS</a> in Cisco IOS 15.1(3)S and XE 3.4S. The IS-IS implementation is pretty rudimentary; the OSPF implementation allows you to specify numerous alternate path selection criteria. For example, you might prefer alternate paths that don’t go over a <em>shared risk link group</em>, through the same LAN interface, or through the next-hop router.</p>

<h4>The fun part</h4><p>I wanted to write about a completely different topic and realized I have to cover yet another topic to explain the root cause of the problem I wanted to describe.</p>

<p>My ramblings tend to be recursive (as anyone who was forced to listen to my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/search?q=campfire">campfire</a> stories can probably attest), and it turned out the final leaf in that recursive process was LFA. Will you try to guess where I started?</p>
