<p>Every so often I get a question along the lines of “<em>could I see a sample of your webinars before I buy them?</em>” To answer the question, I <a href="http://demo.ipspace.net/bin/start">created a new web site</a> that includes the videos I previously <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/IvanPx">published on YouTube</a>, as well as plenty of information on what exactly you get when you <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Recordings">buy a recording</a> or the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">yearly subscription</a>. Your feedback on site outline/design and its contents is highly appreciated!</p>
