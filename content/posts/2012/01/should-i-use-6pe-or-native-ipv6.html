title: Should I use 6PE or native IPv6 transport?
url: /2012/01/should-i-use-6pe-or-native-ipv6.html
---

<p>One of my students was watching the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core"><em>Building IPv6 Service Provider Core</em></a> webinar and wondered whether he should use 6PE or native IPv6 transport:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Could you explain further why it is better to choose 6PE over running IPv6 in the core? I have to implement IPv6 where I work (a small ISP) and need to fully understand why I should choose a certain implementation.</blockquote>
<p>Here’s a short decision tree that should help you make that decision:<!--more--></p>
<p class="warn">The decision tree should help you answer the question: “should I use native IPv6 transport or IPv6-over-MPLS for the global IPv6 connectivity?” L2/L3 VPN services are out of scope.</p>
<hr/><p style="margin-bottom: 0">Do you already have MPLS in your network?</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0"> <li><em>Yes</em>: Do you use features like MPLS TE or FRR?</li>
<ul><li><em>Yes</em>: you must use 6PE.</li>
<li><em>No</em>: you could run IPv6 natively. Do you run BGP (for Internet services) on all core routers?</li>
<ul><li><em>No: </em>Don’t change the network design, use 6PE.</li>
<li><em>Yes:</em> You could run either native IPv6 or 6PE. Native IPv6 requires IPv6 deployment on all core routers. 6PE needs IPv6 only on PE routers and route reflectors.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li><em>No</em>: Are you willing to deploy MPLS?</li>
<ul> <li><em>No</em>: Forget 6PE, use native IPv6.</li>
<li><em>Yes</em>: Will you deploy IPv6 gradually (only on a few PE-routers)?</li>
<ul> <li><em>Yes</em>: Introduction of MPLS and 6PE might make sense.</li>
<li><em>No</em>:  Forget it, doesn't make sense to introduce MPLS just for IPv6</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<hr/><h4>More information</h4><p>To get an initial overview of what’s needed to deploy IPv6 in your network, watch the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Service_Provider_IPv6_Introduction"><em>Service Provider IPv6 Introduction</em></a> or <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Enterprise_IPv6_-_the_First_Steps"><em>Enterprise IPv6 – the first steps</em></a> webinar. You’ll find network core design and deployment guidelines in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core"><em>Building IPv6 Service Provider Core</em></a> webinar; IPv6 access network design and deployment are described in the <a href="http://spipv6-blog.eventbrite.com/"><em>Building Large IPv6 Access Networks</em></a> webinar. You get access to all four webinars (and a <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Recordings">dozen more</a>) with the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">yearly subscription</a>.</p>
