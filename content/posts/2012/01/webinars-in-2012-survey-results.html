<p>A few weeks ago I <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/12/help-me-plan-new-webinars-in-2012.html">asked you to help me plan the new webinars in 2012</a>. More than a 100 readers responded – a huge thank you (there’s a small present waiting in your Inbox if you left your e-mail address)!</p>
<p>I expected some of the results, others totally surprised me. Here are the winners (you can also <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/files/Webinars_2012P.pdf">download the full report</a>).<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>#1 - IPv6 access networks update</strong>. No major surprise here; I expected this topic to be popular, but not to be the winner. The webinar is already scheduled for late January.</p>
<p><strong>#2 – Data Center and Virtual Networking Security</strong>. Definitely an important topic, but I didn’t expect it to be this high in the list. I’ll wait for vASA public release; the webinar will probably be ready sometime in late summer/early autumn (there are a few other things I’d like to do as prerequisites to this one).</p>
<p><strong>#3 – Metro Ethernet and VPLS</strong>. This one totally surprised me. I expected VPLS and Metro Ethernet to be boring old news. MPLS-TP appearing in GA releases (for example, <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios-xml/ios/mp_basic/configuration/xe-3s/mp-mpls-tp.html">IOS XE 3S</a>) will make this topic even sexier; expect a webinar sometime in summer.</p>
<p><strong>#4 – vSphere 5.0 networking update</strong>. No surprises here. Webinar tentatively scheduled for late April/early May.</p>
<p><strong>#5 – NAT64 and DNS64</strong>. Very interesting, didn’t expect it to be this high on the list. I’ll combine NAT64 with 6-to-4 and 4-to-6 load balancing. As there are numerous shipping implementations, I’ll try to get this one done in late March.</p>
<h4>Other suggestions</h4><p>The survey also had the <em>other suggestions </em>option. Here are some of them:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>OpenFlow – already scheduled for February 7<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span>.</li>
<li>MPLS/VPN fast convergence – interesting, but not sure it’s worth an independent webinar.</li>
<li>Network Virtualization Fundamentals in detail – the next session of <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/VMintro"><em>Introduction to Virtualized Networking</em></a><em> </em>is in two days (and there are <a href="http://vnetintro.eventbrite.com/">still a few seats left</a>).</li>
<li>Layer-3 redundancy on top of VPLS – some of that is covered in the <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Choose_the_optimal_VPN_service"><em>Choose the Optimal VPN Service</em></a> webinar. <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/02/how-would-you-use-vpls-transport-in-l2.html">This blog post</a> might also help a bit.</li>
<li>QoS and Voice – these topics are covered in more than enough details in regular training classes from Cisco and other vendors.</li>
</ul>
