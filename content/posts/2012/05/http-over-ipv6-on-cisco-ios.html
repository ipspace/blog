<p>Stumbled across this marvel while updating my IPv6 presentations for a <a href="http://www.reissromoli.it/index.php/ipv6-e-tempo-di-migrare-ii-edizione.html">2-day seminar in Milano and Rome</a> (straight from <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ipv6/command/reference/ipv6_04.html#wp2519507">15.2M&amp;T command reference</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="cite">With IPv6 support added in Cisco IOS Release 12.2(2)T, the <strong>ip http server</strong> command simultaneously enables and disables both IP and IPv6 access to the HTTP server. However, an access list configured with the <strong>ip http access-class</strong> command will only be applied to IPv4 traffic. IPv6 traffic filtering is not supported.</blockquote>
<p>Wait ... WHAT? I cannot control who can access the HTTP(S) server running in Cisco IOS over IPv6 (apart from kludges like ingress ACLs on all interfaces or CoPP), and this stupidity has been left unfixed for nine(9) years?. Are we really in 2012, less than a month away from <a href="http://www.worldipv6launch.org/">World IPv6 Launch</a> or have I been transported to 1990â€™s?</p>
