<p>A week ago a friend sent me a disturbing email: another <a href="/2011/03/internet-morons-are-so-amazing/">creative individual</a> has decided to use my content to attract traffic, this time making sure to remove all the links and even the webinar introductions before republishing it. As expected, the well-populated web site had no <em>about </em>or <em>contact me </em>links, and the domain name registrant was an obvious fake.<!--more--></p>
<p>Fortunately, the web site happened to be hosted by a US-based cloud services provider, and thus I could use a great advice <a href="https://ripe64.ripe.net/archives/video/24/">offered by Gorazd Božič during RIPE64 meeting</a> (the video is well worth watching) – don’t even try to argue with the web site owner or hosting provider, contact the provider's lawyers with <a href="http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2009/07/06/sample-dmca-take-down-letter/id=4501/">DMCA takedown notice</a>. </p>
<p class="info">Another hint from Gorazd: don’t send the DMCA takedown notice to the regular ISP contacts, use the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/onlinesp/list/a_agents.html">Directory of Service Provider Agents</a>.</p>
<p>A week later, my content is gone from the site and replaced with a stolen copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cisco-Field-Manual-Router-Configuration/dp/1587050242">Cisco Field Manual: Router Configuration</a> ... the whack-a-mole game continues.</p>
