<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/beatriceghorra">Beatrice Ghorra</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/beebux">@beebux</a>) was kind enough to share the results of her IPv6-over-PPPoE tests with me. </p>
<p><strong>Short summary:</strong> everything works as expected on ASR 1K running IOS XE 3.7.<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite">I have tested PPPoE v4/v6 in a 6VPE context on an ASR 1006 with IOS-XE 3.7 (which enables this feature). I have successfully received a Delegated V6 Prefix as well as a Framed IPv6 Route on my CPE via Radius. The DHCPv6 works great on the ASR1K and is now VRF aware (but there is no need to put it in a VRF in our case). Both IPv4/IPv6 sessions are up and running and I can see all routes in both address-families in the VRF which was also received in a Radius Attribute.</blockquote>
<p>Great job, Cisco! Congratulations to the IPv6 teams! Now let’s make sure all these features work in 15.2M ;)</p>
