<p>A while ago I decided to figure out how well various vendors support virtualized networking (one of the answers: <a href="/2011/04/vcloud-director-networking.html">some of the solutions don’t scale</a>) and what can be done with virtual network appliances (I was <a href="/2011/03/ipv6-enabling-your-legacy-applications.html">pleasantly surprised by F5’s BIG-IP LTM VE</a> and Vyatta). You’ll find some of my other thoughts on this subject in the <a href="http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/tip/Virtual-network-appliances-Benefits-and-drawbacks"><em>Virtual network appliances: Benefits and drawbacks</em></a><em> </em>article published by SearchNetworking.</p>
