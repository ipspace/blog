<h4>General networking</h4><p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6192">Protecting the router control plane (RFC 6192)</a>: among other goodies, this document has a high-level description of high speed routers (sometimes known as layer-3 switches).</p>
<p><a href="http://etherealmind.com/network-administrator-role-going-away/">Is the network administrator role going away</a>? I’ve heard the “something is going away” prediction too often in the last 20 years. We just end up doing other (more complex) things.</p>
<p><a href="http://lonesysadmin.net/2011/03/30/8-hints-for-using-dns-more-effectively/">8 hints for using DNS more effectively</a> – another great post from The Lone Sysadmin.</p>
<!--more--><h4>IPv6</h4><p>Yeah, I know, it never stops ... after being ignored for 15 years, IPv6 is becoming as hot as fabrics.</p>
<p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6177">IPv6 Address Assignment to End Sites (RFC 6177)</a> removes the stupid recommendation of assigning /48 to residential end-users. Finally we’re making some progress toward sanity. The /64-per-subnet one is still there.</p>
<p>Windows 7 seems to have weird problems with <a href="http://starshock.blogspot.com/2011/01/windows-7-source-address-selection-and.html">proper source address selection when using ULA addresses</a>. The “use ULA internally to avoid renumbering” recommendation seems to be on hold ... (thanks for the link, <a href="http://twitter.com/bobmccouch/status/52208328893403137">@bobmccouch</a>)</p>
<p><a href="http://samsclass.info/ipv6/proj/projL3-scapy-ra.html">Project L3: Router Advertisements with scapy</a> – teaching kids how to hack IPv6 networks as a science project.</p>
<p><a href="http://getipv6.info/index.php/Customer_problems_that_could_occur">Customer problems that could occur</a> – nice list of things that can go wrong during IPv6 deployment.</p>
<p><a href="http://h30507.www3.hp.com/t5/HP-Networking/IPv6-acceptance-Should-you-consider-IPv4-style-solutions/ba-p/89523">IPv6 acceptance: Should you consider IPv4-style solutions?</a> Good overview. It seems <a href="http://h10026.www1.hp.com/netipv6/Ipv6.htm">HP has pretty rich IPv6 implementation</a>, but my cynical mind never rests.</p>
<blockquote class="cite">“While SLAAC does not have as rich a set of parameters as DHCPv6, it is available whenever and wherever your router is.” Means you don’t have DHCPv6 server functionality in your routers, right?</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://pktmaniac.info/2011/04/routing-an-ipv6-core-on-link-local-addresses/">Routing an IPv6 Core on Link-Local Addresses</a>: you can run an entire IPv6 core on link-local addressed ... but just because you could doesn’t mean that you should. Yandy provides a good description of advantages and caveats.</p>
<h4>Odd bits and pieces</h4><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/03/teaching-kids-how-to-have-a-discussion/">Teaching kids how to have a discussion</a>. Some adults obviously never got that lesson in the kindergarten.</p>
<p>Jose Leitao from the <a href="http://blog.initialdraft.com/">Initial Draft blog</a> has <a href="http://blog.initialdraft.com/archives/1971">asked me a few questions about Cisco certifications and my webinars</a>.</p>
