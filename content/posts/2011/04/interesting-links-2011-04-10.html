<h4>Networking</h4><p>Job Snijders describes why he thinks <a href="http://blog.snijders-it.nl/2011/04/lisp-is-serious-business.html">LISP is serious business</a> and FryGuy wrote an <a href="http://blog.fryguy.net/2011/04/07/lisp-locator-identifier-separation-protocol-say-what/">in-depth article describing LISP</a> (one item less on my to-do list ;).</p>
<h4>Data Center</h4><p>Brook Reams published an <a href="http://community.brocade.com/community/brocadeblogs/vcs/blog/2011/04/06/brocade-isl-trunking-has-almost-perfect-load-balancing">excellent article describing how Brocade’s load balancing works</a>, including some details I <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/04/brocade-vcs-fabric-has-almost-perfect.html">couldn’t possible find out</a> from publicly-available documentation.</p>
<!--more--><p>John Oltsik @ Network World writes about <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/flat-network-confusion">flat network confusion</a>. I particularly liked this part:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Attention networking industry: This techno-geek debate is only confusing your customers and prospects. Most organizations don't care how you flatten the network, they simply want something that works and supports their business processes.</blockquote>
<p>Chuck Hollis ponders <a href="http://chucksblog.emc.com/chucks_blog/2011/04/game-over-in-the-cpu-wars.html">CPU wars and Intel’s obvious victory</a>. Some of his observations are also very relevant in the networking industry.</p>
<p>You’ll find a good <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Data_Center/VMDC/tech_eval/mFCoEwp.html">in-depth Multihop FCoE article</a> on Cisco’s web site.</p>
<h4>Virtualization</h4><p>Most of us probably don’t care about Microsoft’s claims of reduced power consumption in IE9, but it <a href="http://lonesysadmin.net/2011/04/07/why-internet-explorer-9s-power-consumption-matters/">does matter in VDI environment</a>. </p>
<p>Cutting down on wasted keystrokes, <a href="http://gregferro.com/spelling-virtualisation-as-v12n">virtualization will be henceforth known as v12n</a>.</p>
<h4>IPv6</h4><p>RIPE NCC is publishing a weekly-updated <a href="http://www.ripe.net/internet-coordination/ipv4-exhaustion/ipv4-available-pool-graph">IPv4 Available Pool</a> graph. </p>
<p>APNIC has a <a href="http://www.apnic.net/community/ipv4-exhaustion/graphical-information">similar graph, but updated daily</a>. They’ve consumed almost a full /8 in two weeks and they have less than 1.5 /8 left.</p>
<h4>Other bits &amp; pieces</h4><p><a href="http://www.cherokee-project.com/">Cherokee web server</a> is supposed to be good (according to <a href="http://twitter.com/plankers/status/56220363960483840">@plankers</a>). It definitely looks interesting.</p>
<p>Jose Leitao published the <a href="http://blog.initialdraft.com/archives/1850">most interesting tidbits from his interviews</a>. Not surprisingly, once you exclude the self-promotional bits, we were all saying more or less the same thing.</p>
