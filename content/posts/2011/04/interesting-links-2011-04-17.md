### Data Center

[RFC 6165 documents the layer-2 related IS-IS extensions](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6165). No more excuses along the "TRILL standards are not ready" lines. Are you listening, Brocade and HP?

[Data Center Feng Shui: Architecting for Predictable Performance](http://devcentral.f5.com/weblogs/macvittie/archive/2011/04/13/predictable-performance-eliminating-variable-latency-with-hardware.aspx). A nice introductory explanation of advantages of hardware-based forwarding.

[When is a Fabric not a Fabric](http://forums.juniper.net/t5/Architecting-the-Network/When-is-a-Fabric-not-a-Fabric/ba-p/84022)? Juniper continues the "who's the smartest kid on the block" game. I thought we're all adults; stop the "bright future" promises and get the products out.

[Is Open Compute A Game-Changer](http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/04/08/roundup-is-open-compute-a-game-changer/)? Collection of responses to Facebook's Open Compute initiative.

Cisco OTV Deep Dive: [Part 1](http://ccie5851.blogspot.com/2011/02/otv-deep-dive-part-one.html), [Part 2](http://ccie5851.blogspot.com/2011/02/otv-deep-dive-part-two.html), [Part 3](http://ccie5851.blogspot.com/2011/03/otv-deep-dive-part-3.html). Enjoy!

### IPv6

[APNIC ran out of IPv4 addresses](http://www.apnic.net/publications/news/2011/final-8). This went faster than I've expected; my last week's predictions were second half of April.

### Other bits-and-pieces

[34 thoughts for 34 years](http://lonesysadmin.net/2011/04/13/34-thoughts-for-34-years/). Good ones. Read, mull over, use, repeat.

[Skeptic's checklist](http://www.execupundit.com/2011/04/skeptics-checklist.html). If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. A must-have every time you read a report from an "independent industry analyst" (you know, the T\*, G\*, L\* and I\* crowd \... now if only someone could make a nice acronym out of that like [PIGS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIGS_(economics))).

[Ship it!](http://www.christianrenaud.com/weblog/2011/02/ship-it.html) It doesn't help if you have a perfect product that you delay forever because it's missing just one more feature.
