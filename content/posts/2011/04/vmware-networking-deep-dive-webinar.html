<p>If you’re a networking engineer, you could easily get confused by the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/11/vmware-virtual-switch-no-need-for-stp.html">intricacies of the virtual switch</a> embedded in the VMware hypervisor, as it never behaves like you’d expect a layer-2 LAN switch to behave. Likewise, if you’re a virtualization engineer using (distributed) vSwitch for years, you might never understand the problems your network-focused peers are talking about. I’ll try to bridge that gap (ok, build a shaky footbridge) and explore a few exciting new technologies like vShield products, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/04/vcloud-director-networking.html">vCDNI</a> and <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps11208/index.html">VSG</a> in my new <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/VMnet">VMware Networking Deep Dive</a> webinar starting in early June (<a href="http://vnetwork.eventbrite.com/">register here</a>).</p>
<p>To ensure the webinar stays honest and accurate on the VMware side, <a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org/about/">Scott Lowe</a> has graciously offered his help in content development... and who knows, he might even drop by during the live session. Thank you, Scott!!!</p>
