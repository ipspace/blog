<p>Earlier this month <a href="/2011/04/what-is-openflow.html">I wrote</a> “<em>we’ll probably have to wait at least a few years before we’ll see a full-blown hardware product implementing OpenFlow 1.1</em><em>.</em>” (and probably repeated something along the same lines in during the <a href="http://packetpushers.net/show-40-upending-networking/">OpenFlow Packet Pushers podcast</a>). I was wrong (and I won’t split hairs and claim that an academic proof-of-concept doesn’t count). Here it is: <a href="http://twitter.com/nbk1">@nbk1</a> pointed me to a <a href="http://groups.geni.net/geni/attachment/wiki/GEC10DemoSummary/UQAM-Openflow-Genidemo-Poster_V_1.0.pdf?format=raw">100 Gbps switch implementing the latest-and-greatest OpenFlow 1.1</a>. </p>
<!--more--><p>The trick lies in the <a href="http://www.ezchip.com/p_np4.htm">NP-4 network processors from EZchip</a>. These <a href="http://www.ezchip.com/Images/pdf/NP-4_Short_Brief_online.pdf">amazing beasts</a> are powerful enough to handle the linked tables required by OpenFlow 1.1; the researchers “just” had to implement the OpenFlow API and compile OpenFlow TCAM structures into NP-4 microcode.</p>
<p>I have to admit I’m impressed (and as some people know, <a href="http://www.douglasgourlay.com/blog/2010/10/on-gestalt-its-netfield-dat/">that’s not an easy task</a>). It doesn’t matter whether the solution can handle full 100 Gbps or what the pps figures are; they got very far very soon using off-the-shelf hardware, so it shouldn’t be impossibly hard to repeat the performance and launch a commercial product. The only question is the price of the NP-4 chipset (including associated TCAM they were using) – can someone build a reasonably-priced switch out of that hardware?</p>
<p>Along the same lines: would anyone know which vendors/products are using the NP-4 chips? That information might give us some insight into how pricey an NP-4-based switch could be.</p>
