Many service providers choosing IS-IS as their IGP use it within a single area (or at least run all routers as L1L2 routers). Multi-level IS-IS design is a royal pain, more so in MPLS environments where every PE-router needs a distinct route for every BGP next hop (but of course there's a nerd knob to disable L1 default route in IS-IS). Moreover, MPLS TE is reasonably simple only within a single level (L1 or L2).

I'm positive at least some service providers do something as stupid as I usually did -- deploy IS-IS with default settings using a configuration similar to this one:
<!--more-->
{{<cc>}}Typical IS-IS configuration{{</cc>}}
``` {.code}
interface Loopback0
 ip address 10.0.1.1 255.255.255.255
 ip router isis
!
interface Serial1/0

router isis
 net 49.0000.0000.cccc.0001.00

```

The above router configuration and the printouts included in this post were generated on a simple 4-router service provider network I'm using for lab configurations in the [Building IPv6 Service Provider Core](http://www.ipspace.net/IPv6SPCore) webinar (IPv6 has been removed to simplify the printouts).

After the IS-IS adjacencies are established, the **show isis neighbors** command displays the expected results: all adjacencies are L1L2 adjacencies.

``` {.code}
PE-A#show isis neighbors

Tag null:
System Id      Type Interface   IP Address      State Holdtime Circuit Id
RR             L1L2 Se1/4       10.0.7.54       UP    27       00
P              L1L2 Se1/0       10.0.7.10       UP    25       00
```

The IS-IS database looks OK: every router originates an L1 LSP and an L2 LSP (there are also LSPs for Ethernet segments, for example P.02-00)

A detailed look in any L2 LSP reveals the horror behind the scenes: every single IP prefix known to IS-IS is advertised in every L2 LSP (there are four loopback addresses advertised by PE-A, even though it only has one).

```

The explanation of this seemingly absurd behavior is very simple: every L1L2 router leaks intra-area L1 routes into L2 topology. If the L1 and L2 topology overlap (which should not be the case), you get every single L1 prefix in every single L2 LSP. It's obviously not a good idea to cram a round peg (IP routing) into a square hole (CLNS routing protocol with totally different addressing hierarchy).

Apart from consuming way too much memory, this behavior generates a few other side effects:

-   Every time there's a topology change, every router in your network runs SPF twice; once for L1 and once for L2. It also changes its L2 LSP based on the results;
-   All the changed L2 LSPs are flooded across the network;
-   Changed L2 LSPs trigger partial L2 SPF in every router \... and if you're trigger-happy and have reduced SPF timers, you might get more than one partial SPF run due to late arrival of some changes.

Obviously it makes no sense to run IS-IS in L1L2 mode if you have only a single IS-IS area. I would prefer L2-only mode; if you run IS-IS only in level-1, you might get an inadvertent default route caused by a misconfigured L1L2 router.

To change the router type to L2-only takes a single command in Cisco IOS: **is-type level-2-only**. According to my today's understanding of Junos, it might be a bit more complex to do the same thing there (feedback welcome).

After the configuration change, the L2 LSP originated by PE-A contains just the local IP prefixes:

```

**Summary**: Unless you have very good reasons to do otherwise, run IS-IS in a single area and configure all routers as L2-only routers (and remember: [using recipes without understanding them can hurt your network](http://networkingnerd.net/2010/10/16/now-put-that-thing-back-where-it-came-from-or-so-help-me/)).
