<p>The “discovery of the week” award goes to Terry Slattery for pointing out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bufferbloat">dangers of bufferbloat</a> while investigating TCP retransmissions (<a href="http://www.netcordia.com/community/blogs/terrys_blog/archive/2011/09/29/application-analysis-using-tcp-retransmissions-part-1.aspx">part 1</a> and <a href="http://www.netcordia.com/community/blogs/terrys_blog/archive/2011/10/12/application-analysis-using-tcp-retransmissions-part-2.aspx">part 2</a>). BTW, in the end, he figured out it was just an <a href="http://www.netcordia.com/community/blogs/terrys_blog/archive/2011/11/02/rethinking-interface-error-reports.aspx">overloaded Gigabit Ethernet linecard</a>.</p>
<p>Two other interesting discoveries: <a href="https://labs.ripe.net/Members/dbayer/visibility-of-prefix-lengths">PA /48 IPv6 prefixes are still filtered</a> and <a href="http://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2011-12/flat.html">BGP is more stable than we thought it would be</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>Another treasure trove of great posts is the <a href="http://techfieldday.com/2011/nfd2-links/">Networking Tech Field Day</a> web site – just go to the <em>Post-Event Blogs </em>section and read them all; they're all worth it. Most amusing one: <a href="http://techfieldday.com/2011/nfd2-links/">The Comic Edition</a>. Another must-read: <a href="http://datacenteroverlords.com/2011/11/03/the-problem/">The Problem</a>.</p>
<p>In the “My FUD is better than yours” department we have an <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/downloads/TEL/fnc/whitepapers/ConnectionOrientedEthernetODwp.pdf">MPLS-bashing white paper from Fujitsu</a> (I decided dissecting it and writing a response is a waste of time and would only increase cosmic entropy) and <a href="http://forums.juniper.net/t5/Networking-Security-Now/BYOD-Isn-t-As-Scary-As-You-Think-Mr-or-Ms-CIO/ba-p/115930">BYOD Isn’t As Scary As You Think</a> from Juniper.</p>
<h4>Cloudy nets</h4><p>James Urquhart writes about new network models (<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-19413_3-20119643-240/cloud-open-source-and-new-network-models-part-1/?tag=txt;title">part 1</a>, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-19413_3-20121638-240/cloud-open-source-and-new-network-models-part-2/?tag=txt;title">part 2</a>, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-19413_3-20126245-240/clouds-open-source-and-new-network-models-part-3/?tag=txt;title">part 3</a>). If you’re even remotely interested in cloud networking, OpenStack, Quantum, Nova and/or OpenFlow, these posts are a must-read.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://chucksblog.emc.com/chucks_blog/2011/10/the-dark-side-of-clouds.html">Dark Side of Clouds</a> by Chuck Hollis is an excellent analysis of “we can build it better” syndrome. I’ve seen the same behavior too many times to find it amusing, but you obviously can’t change some people.</p>
<h4>Data Centers</h4><p>How proprietary is proprietary and when does it matter? <a href="http://networkingnerd.net/2011/10/18/my-way-or-the-highway/">Tom Hollingsworth</a> and <a href="http://datacenteroverlords.com/2011/10/20/yo-momma-so-proprietar/">Tony Bourke</a> offer two interesting perspectives.</p>
<p>Brass Tacks blog has <a href="http://brasstacksblog.typepad.com/brass-tacks/2011/10/fcfcoe-connectivity-options-as-of-1132011.html">another great review of supported FCoE connectivity options</a>.</p>
<h4>IPv6</h4><p>Jan Zorz wrote about an <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=sl&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fgo6.si%2F2011%2F10%2Fnokia-usb-modem-21m02-test-prototipa-part-1%2F">interesting USB modem he received from Nokia</a> (hint: IPv6-enabled 3G modem). He still hasn’t realized that there are a few more English- than Slovenian-speaking people interested in IPv6, and thus his thoughts got a bit scrambled by Google Translate.</p>
