<p>During the last days there have been <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/RagnarBelial/status/134211847682392064">rumors of flying pigs</a> and open speculations whether I’d <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/etherealmind/status/135022944748453889">rename my blog</a> to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/cooperlees/status/134158727677882368">junoshints</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/pcolomes/status/135023518520836096">junioshints</a> due to my Junos-related posts. When even my wife told me to get my act together, it was time to move ... and you can see the first changes at the top left corner of the screen.<!--more--></p>
<p>As the long-time readers of my blog probably still remember, it all started with my decision to write about underdocumented or rarely used features of Cisco IOS, and I named my blog accordingly. I slowly started to explore other topics, discovered interesting new technologies and challenges, and last year’s <a href="http://techfieldday.com/2010/nfd1/">Networking Tech Field day</a> finally pushed me into multi-vendor waters. The blog’s name no longer fit its content. </p>
<p>My lovely wife took matters into her hands, figured out <em>ipSpace</em> might be a way better fit (as all things I write about relate to IP in one way or another), and even designed the new logo. All I had to do was to get a new domain name (ipspace.net) and implement the design.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/103244604531451267644/OdSoErgeDoMlinov#5113460750658831954" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="216" src="/2011/11/s320-BalancingNameChange.JPG" width="320"/></a><br/><span style="font-size: 90%">Every name change is a balancing act</span></div>
<p>The change in the name (and domain) does not impact the blog/web site content or direction in any way. I will continue writing about the same technologies and challenges, and cover products and solutions from major physical and virtual networking vendors. You will eventually notice changed domain name, first for the web site, later for the blog. And just in case you’re wondering – my <a href="http://twitter.com/ioshints">Twitter name</a> will not change.</p>
<p>Some gory technical details: the first stages of the migration have just been completed – <a href="http://www.ipspace.net">www.ipspace.net</a> and <a href="https://www.ipspace.net">www.ioshints.info</a> point to the same web site; all requests are already redirected to www.ipspace.net (which might cause a bit slower loading, but I’m using hard redirects, so hopefully Google &amp; al will pick up the hint). Blog.ipspace.net redirects to blog.ioshints.info, which will remain active for quite a while (please don’t change your links just yet).</p>
<p>Last but definitely not least, I probably managed to break a few things during the migration; error reports are highly appreciated. Thank you!</p>
