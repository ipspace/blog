<p>Finally someone decided to make IPv6 flow label useful. First they had to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6436.txt">justify why they want to change it</a>, and then <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6437">modify the definition</a> (way too much work for a field nobody ever used). Planned use is to enhance ECMP load balancing, both in native IPv6 environments (where using the flow label is faster than digging deep into variable-length IPv6 extension headers) and (even more importantly) in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6438">tunneled environments</a>, where the flow label propagates the entropy from the tunnel payload into the envelope header.</p>
