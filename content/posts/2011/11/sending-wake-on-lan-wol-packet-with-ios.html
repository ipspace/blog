<p>Jónatan Þór Jónasson took the time to implement Wake-on-LAN functionality using UDP support introduced in Cisco IOS Tcl in release 15.1(1)T. He found a <a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/16733">TCL/TK example of a magic packet being sent</a>, used that as a base, and with small modifications got it to work on his router. Here‘s his code (it’s obviously a proof-of-concept, but you need just a few more lines to get a working Tclsh script):<!--more--></p>
<pre class="code">proc WakeOnLan {broadcastAddr macAddr} {<br/>     set net [binary format H* [join [split $macAddr -:] ""]]<br/>     set pkt [binary format c* {0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff}]<br/><br/>     for {set i 0} {$i &lt; 16} {incr i} {<br/>        append pkt $net<br/>     }<br/><br/>     # Open UDP and Send the Magic Paket.<br/>     set udpSock [udp_open]<br/>     fconfigure $udpSock -translation binary \<br/>          -remote [list $broadcastAddr 4580] \<br/>          -broadcast 1<br/>     puts $udpSock $pkt<br/>     flush $udpSock;<br/>     close $udpSock<br/>}</pre><p>For whatever reason, he wasn’t able to generate subnet-specific broadcasts; sending WOL packet to subnet-specific broadcast address didn’t work, while sending it to local broadcast address (255.255.255.255) did (obviously sending the packet through all router interfaces).</p>
<h4>Remote WOL</h4><p>Obviously you could use subnet broadcast address of a remote LAN as a unicast destination address if you’d want to wake a remote PC, but that would require directed broadcast support on the remote router, which is not always a good idea. It’s way better to configure a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/03/generating-layer-2-broadcast-from.html">static ARP entry for a real unicast IP address on remote LAN with broadcast MAC address</a>. In both cases, you shouldn’t specify the ‘-broadcast 1’ flag in Tcl (as you’re sending a unicast UDP packet).</p>
