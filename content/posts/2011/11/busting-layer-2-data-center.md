title: Busting Layer-2 Data Center Interconnect Myths
url: /2011/11/busting-layer-2-data-center/
---
A few weeks ago I delivered a short L2 DCI WebEx presentation to [CCIE Club Poland](http://www.ccie-club-poland.pl/). I took the L2 part of my Data Center Interconnect webinar and added 15 minutes of L2 DCI mythbusting. 

That part of my presentation is [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/7TfBvGo1mCg); for the rest, watch my [Data Center Interconnect](https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Interconnects) webinar.

Last but definitely not least (trying not to be totally negative), there is a good use case for L2 DCI -- [running SNA over OTV](http://twitter.com/ccie5851/status/127463992951181312), because DLSw cannot run @ 10Gb speeds available with the OSA-Express adapters 🤪.
