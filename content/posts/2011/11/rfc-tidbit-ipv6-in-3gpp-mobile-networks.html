<p>Did you ever want to have a high-level overview of how 3G/4G mobile networks work? Where GGSN and SGSN fit in? What the PDP contexts are ... and why you need two for dual-stack connectivity? All that (and a lot more) is explained in very well written IETF draft <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-v6ops-3gpp-eps">IPv6 in 3GPP Evolved Packet System</a>. Reading highly recommended.</p>
