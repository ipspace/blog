The results are ... <a href="http://readonly.labs.ripe.net/Members/emileaben/hampered-eyeballs">interesting</a> ;) ... but <a href="http://readonly.labs.ripe.net/Members/gih/dual-stack-esotropia">it seems most implementations are on the right track</a>.<!--more--></p>
<h4>Data Centers</h4><p><a href="http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/news/2240111448/Long-distance-live-migration-moves-within-reach">Long-distance live migration moves within reach</a> starts with a promising introductory paragraph (which is totally in line with my <a href="/2011/11/busting-layer-2-data-center.html">L2 DCI mythbusting</a>) ...</p>

<p>Network World has managed to publish another masterpiece: <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/111711-sdn-openflow-sidebar-253230.html">6 ways to build SDNs without OpenFlow</a>. In response to that infinite wisdom Omar Baldonado <a href="http://www.bigswitch.com/wp/can-sdn-be-based-on-cli/">described his experience with CLI-based networking device API</a> (very familiar to anyone who had to develop an <em>expect </em>script) and came to the expected conclusion that OpenFlow rocks (hint: BigSwitch is developing an OpenFlow controller).</p>
