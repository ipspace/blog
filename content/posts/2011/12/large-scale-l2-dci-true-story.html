<p>After a week of oversized articles, I’ll try to keep this one short. This is a true story someone recently shared with me (for obvious reasons I can’t tell you where it happened ... and no, I’m not making it up). Enjoy!<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite">Unfortunately I was forced to implement L2 DCI for a "virtual DC" supporting between 4000 and 5000 physical servers with a 25:1 to 30:1 virtualization ratio (so a huge environment). Needless to say in less than 12 months of bringing it online the whole thing melted to a broadcast storm, yet my server team peers still can't understand why it's a bad idea :)</blockquote>

<p>Do I have to add that there are <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/11/busting-layer-2-data-center.html">usually no good reasons to build a L2 data center interconnect</a> and <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Interconnects">plenty of time-tested layer-3 solutions</a> including local and global load balancing and path separation with MPLS/VPN.</p>
