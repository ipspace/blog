title: FCoE and LAG – industry-wide violation of FC-BB-5?

<p>Anyone serious about high-availability connects servers to the network with more than one uplink, more so when using converged network adapters (CNA) with FCoE. Losing all server connectivity after a single link failure simply doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>If at all possible, you should use dynamic link aggregation with LACP to bundle the parallel server-to-switch links into a single aggregated link (also called <em>bonded interface</em><em> </em>in Linux). In theory, it should be simple to combine FCoE with LAG – after all, FCoE runs on top of lossless Ethernet MAC service. In practice, there’s a huge difference between theory and practice.<!--more--></p>
<p>Assume the simplest possible scenario where two 10GE links connect a server to a single adjacent switch:</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/2011/12/s1600-FCoE_Setup.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" src="/2011/12/s400-FCoE_Setup.png"/></a></div>
<p>In theory, the aggregated link should appear as a single interface to the host operating system, and FCoE and IP stack should use the same interface:</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/2011/12/s1600-FCoE_Ideal.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" src="/2011/12/s400-FCoE_Ideal.png"/></a></div>
<p>In reality, hardware network interface cards (NICs) rarely implement link aggregation (it also doesn’t make sense to connect both uplinks to the same hardware), and the aggregated link appears as a logical bonded interface (to confuse the unwary, the physical interface sometimes remain directly reachable). Still no problem, FCoE software stack could use the bonded interface.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/2011/12/s1600-FCoE_Bonded.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" src="/2011/12/s400-FCoE_Bonded.png"/></a></div>
<p>Most CNAs implement FCoE stack in hardware and present two physical interfaces (Ethernet NIC and FC Host Bus Adapter – HBA) to the operating system. Two CNAs thus appear as four independent interfaces to the operating system, with the HBA part of CNA emulating FC host interface and running FCoE stack on the CNA. It’s obviously impossible to run FCoE over the aggregated link, because link aggregation happens way later, above the physical Ethernet device driver. The two CNAs thus need two FCoE sessions with the upstream switch.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/2011/12/s1600-FCoE_2Sess.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" src="/2011/12/s400-FCoE_2Sess.png"/></a></div>
<p>This behavior makes perfect sense, more so in multi-chassis LAG environment where CNAs establish FCoE sessions with different switches, thus maintaining SAN-A/SAN-B separation.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/2011/12/s1600-FCoE_MLAG.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" src="/2011/12/s400-FCoE_MLAG.png"/></a></div>
<p>However, that’s not how FC-BB-5, the standard describing FCoE, is written.</p>
<h4>FC-BB-5 nitpicking</h4><p>FC-BB-5 is not very specific about the underlying layers, it mostly refers to MAC and Lossless Ethernet MAC (example: Figure 26 in Section 7.2). Link aggregation standard (802.1AX) is more specific – in the Overview part (section 5.1) it says:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Link Aggregation allows one or more links to be aggregated together to form a Link Aggregation Group, such that a MAC Client can treat the Link Aggregation Group as if it were a single link.</blockquote>
<p>And later, in the Principles of Link Aggregation (5.2.1):</p>
<blockquote class="cite">A MAC Client communicates with a set of ports through an Aggregator, which presents a standard IEEE 802.3 service interface to the MAC Client.</blockquote>
<p>Clear enough? It is for me.</p>
<h4>What is the industry doing</h4><p>Every single FCoE switch vendor that I’m aware of (Cisco, Brocade, Juniper) is “interpreting” FC-BB-5 in exactly the same way. All switches thus behave in approximately the same way (as described above) and work with the host CNAs ... maintaining interoperability (a good thing) and setting up the stage to trip up an unsuspecting engineer who thinks reading standards can help to figure out how networking devices actually work.</p>
<p>One would understand the discrepancy between FC-BB-5 standard and a typical industry implementation if FC-BB-5 were written by a bunch of theoreticians, but it was (like other FC standards) designed by an industry body with representation from most of the vendors mentioned in the previous paragraph. Proves again what a huge gap there is between theory and practice.</p>
