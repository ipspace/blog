<p>I’m planning a series of shorter (~ 1 hour) update-type webinars in 2012. Some of them will cover new features and technologies that have been introduced since the time I last updated some of the most popular webinars (Data Center, VMware networking), others will focus on emerging technologies.</p>
<p>I would appreciate if you could help me plan them by <a href="http://433206.polldaddy.com/s/wp2012">taking a short survey</a>, telling me which of the topics I identified are most important for you, and adding your favorite topics to the list. The survey won’t take more than a few minutes of your time.</p>
