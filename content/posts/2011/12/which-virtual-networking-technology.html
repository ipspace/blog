<p>After I published the <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/12/decouple-virtual-networking-from.html"><em>Decouple virtual networking from the physical world</em></a> article, <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgear1/status/145382168825311233">@paulgear1 sent me a very valid tweet</a>: “<em>You seemed a little short on suggestions about the path forward. What should customers do right now?</em>” Apart from the obvious “it depends”, these are the typical use cases (as I understand them today – please feel free to correct me).<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Small(er) data centers</strong>: If you have a few hundred physical servers and a few thousand virtual machines, <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/12/vmware-vswitch-baseline-of-simplicity.html">every-VLANs-on-every port design</a> seems to work well ... assuming a solid MLAG-based dual snowflake L2 design and no multicast applications. As long as the amount of background broadcast noise (primarily ARP) stays low, you’ll do just fine.</p>
<p class="note">The moment you deviate from a pure (dual) snowflake design, you might get asymmetrical traffic flows, unknown unicast flooding (more so if you have a mismatch between ARP timers and MAC address aging timers), and an overloaded network.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Implementing a whole data center as a single bridged domain is never a good idea. You should split your infrastructure into several failure domains (aka <em>availability zones</em>) so you don’t <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/12/large-scale-l2-dci-true-story.html">lose everything if you have a bad hair day</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Large(r) data centers</strong> with more than a few hundred servers in a single broadcast domain will probably need <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/12/vm-aware-networking-improves-iaas-cloud.html">VM-aware networking</a> to reduce the amount of flooded traffic sent to each server. Obviously, it would be better to split the data center into numerous smaller broadcast domains, but that’s a discussion for another blog post.</p>
<p><strong>Reasonably small compute pools with numerous tenants</strong> might be well-served by vCDNI. If you have a few hundred physical servers (a reasonable number for a <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/04/vcloud-director-networking.html">single broadcast domain like vCDNI</a> – which is limited to 350 vSphere hosts due to vDS configuration maximums anyway), but need thousands of virtual networks, vCDNI seems like a reasonable solution ... more so if your physical switches support only a few hundred VLANs.</p>
<p><strong>Compute pools distributed </strong><strong>across a data center</strong> for redundancy/maintenance reasons are a perfect use case for <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/08/finally-mac-over-ip-based-vcloud.html">VXLAN</a>. Instead of implementing large-scale bridged domains with FabricPath, TRILL or 802.1aq, you could build virtual segments across L3 infrastructure. </p>
<p class="note">Without the VXLAN documentation (VXLAN is supposed to be available in the next Nexus 1000V software release) it’s impossible to predict how useful it will be. It could be limited to a <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/12/nexus-1000v-and-vmotion.html">single VSM</a>, or there could be “interesting” interactions with vCloud Director.</p>
<p><strong>GRE</strong><strong>-based solution</strong><strong>s with OpenFlow control plane </strong>are a good fit for large-scale operations (public IaaS clouds). They might eventually trickle down to enterprise data centers, but might not be worth the added complexity if you only have a few hundred physical servers.</p>
<p class="warn">Everything I write about Open vSwitch (which uses GRE tunnels) and Nicira’s semi-stealth solutions (which add the control plane to OVS) is pure speculation. You want to know more – go talk to them.</p>
<h4>Anything else?</h4><p>All the other solutions I mentioned are not production-ready. The only shipping <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/05/edge-virtual-bridging-evb-8021qbg-eases.html">EVB</a> implementation seems to be in programmed in PowerPoint, and the Q-in-Q/PBB/VPLS solutions, while interesting, require significant amount of integration/orchestration development efforts.</p>
