<p>The <a href="#wp1181708">online documentation on this topic is pretty extensive</a>, but obviously not explicit enough, so let’s try to reword it.</p>
<!--more--><p>When you use the <strong>sync yes </strong>option in the <strong>event cli </strong>command, the EEM applet runs before the CLI command is executed. The EEM applet should set the <strong>_exit_status</strong> variable to indicate whether the CLI command should be executed (<strong>_exit_status</strong> set to one) or not (<b>_exit_status</b> set to zero). A sample applet using the <b>_exit_status</b> variable in described in my “<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/01/schedule-reload-before-configuring.html"><em>Schedule reload before configuring the router</em></a>” post.</p>
<p>With the <strong>sync no </strong>option, the EEM applet is executed in background <em>in parallel </em>with the CLI command. As the CLI command starts at the same time as the EEM applet, you cannot use the <strong>_exit_status </strong>variable anymore; you have to specify whether you want the CLI command to execute with the <strong>skip yes|no </strong>option of the <b>event cli</b> command. A sample applet using <strong>sync no skip yes </strong>options is described in my “<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/03/can-you-disable-reload-command.html"><em>Can you disable the reload command?</em></a>” post.</p>
