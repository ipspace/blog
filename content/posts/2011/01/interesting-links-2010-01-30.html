<p>Links to interesting content have yet again started gathering dust in my Inbox. Time for a cleanup action. Technical content first:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.virtualizationpractice.com/blog/?p=9080">Cisco Pushing More vNetwork into Hardware</a>. Pretty good description of impact of Nexus 1000V and VN-Link on virtualized network security.</p>
<p><a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2011/jan/24/convergence-delays-svi-vs-routed-interface/">Convergence Delays: SVI vs Routed Interface</a>. Another great article by Stretch. I never realized <strong>carrier-delay</strong> could be that harmful. The moral of the story is also important: test and verify the device behavior, don’t trust PPT slides (once I’ll share with you how I’ve learned that lesson the hard way).</p>
<p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6092">RFC 6092 - Recommended Simple Security Capabilities in Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) for Providing Residential IPv6 Internet Service</a>. A fantastic document – now we can only hope that every magazine evaluating consumer IPv6-ready CPEs starts using it as a benchmark (and that the IPv6 Ready guys pick it up).</p>
<!--more--><p><a href="http://www.unifiedcomputingblog.com/?p=108">8Gb Fibre Channel or 10Gb Ethernet w/ FCoE</a>? The Gigabit Ethernet side of the equation is definitely wrong (10 GE has line rate above 10Gbps) and he missed the encapsulation overhead, but if the FC side is true, it makes FCoE even more compelling.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.virtualizationpractice.com/blog/?p=4284">Rethinking vNetwork Security</a>. An interesting discussion on whether it’s safe to use the same physical server by VMs belonging to different security zones.</p>
<p class="note">Can you guess what the topic of one of my upcoming webinars is going to be?</p>
<p>And some great general purpose and management-focused articles:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2011/01/17/managing_nerds.html">Managing Nerds</a>. If you are a team leader (or a PHB), this one is a must-read.</p>
<p><a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2011/jan/26/supplementary-study-resources/">Supplementary Study Resources</a>. Stretch is producing some amazing non-technical content. Couldn’t agree more.</p>
<p><a href="http://theinternethose.com/2011/01/write-why-reading-isn%C2%B4t-enough/">WRITE: Why Reading Isn´t Enough</a>. I was always saying that you have to build a mental big picture of the topics you’re studying. Here’s a method to help you get it done – write about the things you study. Writing (not tweeting) will help you get yourself organized.</p>
<p><a href="http://andrewmcafee.org/2011/01/jevons-computation-efficicency-hardware-investmen/">19th Century Economist Reveals Surefire Investment Strategy!</a> Extremely interesting theory (backed up with historical data): IT costs will only go up and the cloud computing won’t help us.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cio.com/article/654471/Cloud_Makes_Capacity_Planning_Harder_3_Fight_Back_Tips">Cloud makes capacity planning harder</a>. And the Earth is round. What a discovery! However, if you think that the private or public cloud will make your life easier, the article is still worth reading.</p>
