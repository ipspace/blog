title: Building MPLS/VPN service across an Enterprise WAN

<p>One of the toughest challenges you face when deploying MPLS/VPN in an enterprise network is the WAN transport. If you’re lucky enough to use Frame Relay, ATM or any other layer-2 transport technology (including pseudowires and VPLS), your task is simple: configure <strong>mpls ip </strong>on the WAN interfaces. The going gets tougher when the only option you have is IP-based WAN connectivity, be it Internet-based VPNs or MPLS/VPN from a Service Provider (don’t even start thinking about <em>Carrier’s Carrier </em>architecture; most SPs would have no clue what you’re talking about).</p>
<p>I’ve described some of the options you have in the “<a href="http://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/tip/How-to-prepare-enterprise-WANs-for-MPLS-VPN-integration"><em>How to prepare enterprise WANs for MPLS/VPN integration</em></a>” article published by SearchEnterpriseWan; if you need in-depth information, including tested router configurations ready to be deployed in your lab, <a href="http://mpls.eventbrite.com/">register for</a> the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/EnterpriseMPLS"><em>Enterprise MPLS/VPN Deployment</em></a><em> </em>webinar.</p>
