<p>Interesting links keep appearing in my Inbox. Thank you, my Twitter friends and all the great bloggers out there! Here’s this week’s collection:</p>
<p><a href="http://myvirtualcloud.net/?p=1519">Cores and more Cores… We don’t need them!</a> More is not always better.</p>
<p><a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2011/jan/12/emulating-wans-wanem/">Emulating WANs with WANem</a>. I wanted to blog about WANem for at least three years, now I don’t have to; like always, Stretch did an excellent job.</p>
<p><a href="http://geekblog.solarwinds.com/2011/01/05/new-year-s-resolutions-for-geeks-like-me/">New Year's Resolutions for Geeks Like Me</a>. The ones I like most: Deploy a pure IPv6 subnet somewhere; Put something in public cloud. And there’s “find a mentor” ... more about that in a few months ;)</p>
<!--more--><p><a href="http://etherealmind.com/ietf-3177-ipv6-allocation-policy-update/">IETF IPv6 Address Allocation Policy Being Updated</a>. IETF finally realized they should focus on technology, not on operational issues like address allocation policies.</p>
<p><a href="http://etherealmind.com/musing-on-permanent-ephemeral-knowledge-learning-ccie-methods-tips-techniques/">Musing: On Permanent and Ephemeral Knowledge and Exam Study</a>. Another great one from my friend Greg (@etherealmind) Ferro.</p>
<p>And last but definitely not least, there’s IPv6 entering public awareness ... and triggering all sorts of journalists, analysts, commentators, opinion-expressers and other “thinkers” to blatantly express their opinions with no regard to how far away they might be from the facts. Two recent examples: <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/disappearing-ip-addresses-the-next-tech-panic-2011-01-14">Here comes the new money grab</a> (and the <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2011/jan/17/what-management-reads-about-ipv6/">somewhat sarcastic analysis by @packetlife</a>) and <a href="http://www.scmagazineuk.com/the-trouble-with-ipv6/article/192633/">The trouble with IPv6</a>. Not to mention the <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/feature/Without-killer-IPv6-services-in-the-mix-consumers-arent-IPv6-ready">fantastic discovery that most customers are not willing to pay for IPv6</a> (I’m impressed, I would never have thought it’s possible to make such a breakthrough discovery).</p>
