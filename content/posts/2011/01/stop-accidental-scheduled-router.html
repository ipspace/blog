<blockquote class="cite">It may come in handy creating some form of script that would display some basic upon logout - show debug, show reload etc.</blockquote>
<p>The new capabilities of CLI event detector introduced in EEM 3.0 allow us to catch CLI commands in a particular parser mode. Writing an EEM applet that catches exec-mode <strong>exit </strong>or <strong>logout</strong> and performs a few checks is thus a trivial task.</p>
<!--more--><p>The following applet is a proof of concept; it checks whether a reload is scheduled and prevents the user from exiting a telnet session before cancelling the scheduled reload. Feel free to extend it and add other checks youâ€™d like to see performed.</p>
