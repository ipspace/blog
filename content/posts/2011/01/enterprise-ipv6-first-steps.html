<p>You might have noticed that <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2011/jan/17/what-management-reads-about-ipv6/">IPv6 awareness entered mainstream media</a>, which is always a mixed blessing: on one hand your boss might understand why you need extra budget; on the other hand he might start asking weird questions ... for example what your action plan is (might happen after a golf session with buddies claiming their organization has already deployed this new technology wonder).</p>
<p>If you’re still struggling with the questions like “should I care about IPv6”, “where shall I deploy it first” or “how fast should I react”, my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/EnterpriseIPv6"><em>Enterprise IPv6 – the First Steps</em></a> webinar (<a href="http://entipv6.eventbrite.com/">register here</a>) is just what you need. I’ll try to answer all these questions and cover other important topics like the differences between IPv4 and IPv6, practical deployment recommendations and the potential impact of IPv6 denial strategy.</p>
