title: MPLS/VPN over mGRE strikes again

---

<p>More than five years after the MPLS/VPN-in-mGRE encapsulation was <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4023">standardized</a> (add a few more years for the work-in-progress and IETF draft stages), it <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/interface/configuration/guide/ir_mplsvpnomgre.html">finally debuted in a mainstream-wannabe IOS release running on ISR routers</a> (15.1(2)T), making it usable for the enterprise WAN designers, who are probably its best target audience.</p>
<p>I was <a href="/2010/04/is-anyone-using-mplsvpn-over-mgre/">writing about the two conflicting MPLS/VPN over mGRE implementations</a> a while ago and got the impression the Service Providers aren’t too excited about this option. No wonder – most of them use full-blown MPLS backbones, so they have no need for GRE tunnels. </p>
<!--more--><p>I always thought the MPLS-over-mGRE encapsulation would be more useful in an enterprise environment, but the feature just wasn’t supported on the right platforms (it’s somewhat hard to build a whole enterprise network using just the 7600s and 7200s). All that has changed with the 15.1(2)T release, which allows you to run MPLS/VPN-over-mGRE on ISR and ISR-G2 routers (I got it up and running on a bunch of 2800s in less than half an hour, including the software upgrade).</p>
<p>MPLS/VPN-over-mGRE gives you a lightweight MPLS/VPN transport directly between the PE-routers without the need to configure end-to-end MPLS in your WAN backbone or GRE tunnels on the PE-routers. All you need is VPNv4-enabled BGP infrastructure; the mGRE tunnel interface needed by this feature is created automagically by Cisco IOS and the GRE encapsulation is quietly performed behind-the-scenes – the CEF entries for the remote VPN destinations point to the hidden tunnel interface, the GRE next-hop is set to the BGP next-hop and the MPLS label applied on the ingress PE-router is taken directly from the VPNv4 BGP route.</p>
<p>The following printouts were taken from my simple lab network. Remote PE-router with loopback IP address 172.16.0.12 is advertising a VPN prefix 10.0.0.2/32. The VPNv4 BGP route goes through a route reflector with IP address 172.16.0.11. </p>
<p>Here’s the detailed information about the VPNv4 BGP route (BGP next hop and remote MPLS label are highlighted) ...</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: your enterprise network has to provide connectivity to a spin-off organization that has its offices located at several sites. You have to isolate them from the rest of the enterprise network (thus the need for MPLS/VPN) and you usually have to provide them with minimum-latency any-to-any connectivity; the delay of going through a set of central routers in a hub-and-spoke MPLS/VPN-over-GRE scenario is often prohibitively high in large-scale networks.</p>
<h4>More information</h4><p>MPLS/VPN-over-mGRE is just one of many WAN transport solutions described in my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/EnterpriseMPLS"><em>Enterprise MPLS/VPN Deployment</em></a> webinar. The webinar also covers MPLS/VPN transport across:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Serial links, Frame Relay and ATM;</li>
<li>Switched Ethernet, including pseudowires and VPLS services;</li>
<li>GRE tunnels, including IPSec-protected GRE tunnels;</li>
<li>DMVPN, including three methods of running MPLS/VPN over Phase 2 DMVPN networks with direct spoke-to-spoke connectivity.</li>
</ul>
