<p>Did you know that whenever you use Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) tables in your network (be it on routers or on high-end switches), you’re actually benefitting from one of the MPLS/VPN technologies – VRFs were first introduced by Cisco to support the MPLS/VPN technology.</p>
<p>VRFs are pretty common in enterprise networks; the first half of my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/EnterpriseMPLS">Enterprise MPLS/VPN Deployment </a>webinar thus deals with VRFs, Multi-VRF (also known as VRF-Lite) and all sorts of VRF services, including VRF-aware NAT, per-VRF DHCP pools and interesting combinations of VRFs and GRE tunnels. Here’s the part where I explain what VRFs are as compared to VLANs:</p>
