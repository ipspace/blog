<p>The question of high-availability cloud services (let’s agree <em>reliable </em>in this context really means <em>highly available</em>) pops up every time I discuss cloud networking requirements with enterprise-focused experts. While it’s obvious the software- and platform services must be highly available (as their users have few mechanisms to increase their availability), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) remains a grey area.</p>
<p>However, once you look at the question from the business perspective, it seems Amazon probably made a pretty good choice: offer reasonably-available service at a low price. You’ll find more in-depth arguments in the <a href="http://searchcloudprovider.techtarget.com/tip/Cloud-infrastructure-services-Balancing-high-availability-and-cost"><em>Cloud infrastructure services: Balancing high availability and cost</em></a> article I wrote for SearchCloudProvider.com.</p>
