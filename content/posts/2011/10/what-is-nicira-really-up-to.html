<p>Yesterday <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/what-is-nicira-up-to/">New York Times published an article covering Nicira</a>, a semi-stealthy startup working on an open source soft switch (Open vSwitch) and associated OpenFlow-based controller, triggering immediate responses from <a href="http://gigaom.com/cloud/whats-nicira-read-this-and-find-out/">GigaOm</a> and <a href="http://nerdtwilight.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/nicira-downplays-openflow-on-road-to-network-virtualization/">Twilight in the Valley of the Nerds</a>. While everyone got entangled in the buzzwords (or lack of them), not a single article answered the question “what is Nicira really doing?” Let’s fix that.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Short summary</strong>: Nicira is developing a layer-3-aware soft switch for Xen/KVM that could be able to route (not bridge) IP and IPv6 in the hypervisor. Combined with the ability to establish dynamic GRE (or CAPWAP or VXLAN) tunnels between the hypervisors, and an OpenFlow-based scalable controller, they could have the only solution I’m aware of that might be on par with Amazon EC2 VPC. If you want to build <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/05/scaling-iaas-network-infrastructure.html">huge scalable IaaS cloud infrastructure</a>, Nicira is definitely a company you should be talking to.</p>
<p class="warn"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: My contacts within Nicira consistently and politely declined my questions about their products. This blog post is a pure speculation reverse-engineered from publicly available documentation.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt the main focus of Nicira is hypervisor-based soft switching and virtual networks built directly between hypervisors. They are behind the <a href="http://openvswitch.org/">Open vSwitch</a> that is now part of official XenServer distribution. Open vSwitch can act like a simple layer-2 learning switch, or it could be programmed through OpenFlow extended with numerous Nicira-developed features (some of them <a href="http://www.openflow.org/wk/index.php/OpenFlow_1_2_proposal">submitted for inclusion in OpenFlow 1.2</a>).</p>
<p>It’s pretty evident to me Nicira doesn’t want to get involved in core network programming. For example, the Open vSwitch has embedded LACP and 802.1ag support (similar to <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/09/nexus-1000v-lacp-offload-and-dangers-of.html">Nexus 1000V LACP offload</a>) instead of running control protocols through the OpenFlow controller like a purist implementation should do. They also rely on GRE tunnels to get data between hypervisors rather than trying to program hop-by-hop flows throughout the network. Obviously these people are smart and well aware of how hard it is to scale solutions with per-flow state.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://openvswitch.org/cgi-bin/ovsman.cgi?page=utilities%2Fovs-ofctl.8&amp;format=pdf">documentation for Open vSwitch Open Flow Controller CLI</a> is a treasure trove of information about Open vSwitch features (I don’t have the mental energy to browse through the source code and I haven’t found a document describing Nicira’s OpenFlow extensions explicitly – if there’s one, please add the link in the comments). Assuming everything described there actually works, Open vSwitch can do (among other things):</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Layer-2 forwarding (bridging),</li>
<li>802.1Q VLAN tagging,</li>
<li>802.1p-based QoS,</li>
<li>ARP forwarding to OpenFlow controller,</li>
<li>IPv4 and IPv6 matching (ACL) and forwarding,</li>
<li>Forwarding to and from GRE tunnels,</li>
<li>Modifying source and destination IP addresses and port numbers (NAT, server load balancing),</li>
<li>Load balancing across multiple links.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Open vSwitch seems to supports up to 255 independent forwarding tables, so it’s possible to implement <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/04/vcloud-architects-ever-heard-of-mpls.html">numerous layer-3-aware VRFs within the same hypervisor</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The OpenFlow actions listed in the above document do not include TTL handling, so it seems that although Open vSwitch is layer-3 aware, it’s still not a true router – it can forward packets between hypervisors (using GRE tunnels) based on destination IP addresses, but not route between subnets.</p>
<p>Still, the big question is: “how far did they get with their controller?” The <a href="http://www.ntt.co.jp/news2011/1108e/110802a.html">NTT press release</a> and <a href="http://www.ntt.co.jp/news2011/1108e/110802a_1.html">associated diagram</a> hint at <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/08/finally-mac-over-ip-based-vcloud.html">VXLAN-like</a> capability (with proper OpenFlow-based control plane). I hope they didn’t stop at yet another L2-over-GRE solution; it’s perfectly possible to implement a solution equivalent to Amazon EC2 VPC with Open vSwitch (including IPv6 support which is still lacking in VPC), but we don’t know whether Nicira already has truly L3-aware OpenFlow controller.</p>
