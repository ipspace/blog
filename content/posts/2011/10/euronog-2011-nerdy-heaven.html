<p>I just came back from a fantastic conference – <a href="http://euronog.eu/meeting2011">EuroNOG 2011</a> in beautiful Krakow. I’ve been to too many conferences in my life, but this one really stood out for two reasons: the nerdiness factor (where it got to the level of advanced presentations @ Cisco Live) and the fantastic crew organizing it. <!--more--></p>
<p>I managed to learn about new IS-IS and BGP features (LFA, PIC and BGP AddPaths) straight from the source – <a href="http://inl.info.ucl.ac.be/pfr">Pierre Francois</a> who was talking about them was deeply involved in their development – and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/elisaj">Elisa Jascinska</a> told me everything I need to know about sFlow in 30 minutes. Being pulled into an IPv6 round table at the very last moment, having a great interview with the local PR team, and recording three awesome PacketPusher podcasts just added to the fun ... not to mention the great in-depth conversations I had with engineers attending the event (even though some of them involved VPLS and L2 DCI).</p>
<p>The icing on the cake were the social events they organized. A visit to the <a href="http://mlp.h2.pl/indexen.php">Polish Aviation Museum</a> was like a trip to a candy store – being able to (almost) touch tens of aircrafts, from WWI twin-wing relicts and legendary Spitfire to F-104 and Mig 21and Mig 29 was my child dreams come true.</p>

<p>The visit to the nearby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wieliczka_Salt_Mine">salt mine</a> was a totally different experience – imagine a business that was operating continuously for over 900 years. We had the privilege to observe centuries-old stackable infrastructure, the kludges they had to use to get their designs right, and the nervousness IPv6 packets must experience while being pushed into long winding IPv4 tunnels. </p>

<p>All I can say is: Thank you, Andrzej, Emilia, Ela and the <a href="http://proidea.org.pl/">Proidea</a> team for marvelous four days I spent in Krakow, and I’m looking forward to meeting you again at the EuroNOG 2012.</p>
<p>And last, but definitely not least: all the pictures in this post were taken by Greg (@etherealmind) Ferro because I'm too stupid to take my camera with me. Thank you Greg for sharing them with me!</p>
