title: Follow-the-sun workload mobility? Get lost!

<p>A week ago I was writing about the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/09/long-distance-vmotion-for-disaster.html">latency and bandwidth challenges of long-distance vMotion</a> and why it rarely makes sense to use it in disaster avoidance scenarios (for a real disaster avoidance story, <a href="http://www.virtualizationimpact.com/?p=1854">read this post</a> ... and note no vMotion was used to get out of harm’s way). The article I wrote for SearchNetworking tackles an idea that is an order of magnitude more ridiculous: <a href="http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/news/1280099182/Myth-of-VM-mobility-and-follow-the-sun-data-centers">using vMotion to migrate virtual machines around the world to bring them close to the users</a> (follow-the-sun workload mobility). I wonder which islands you’d have to use to cross the Pacific in 10ms RTT hops supported by vMotion?</p>
<p>As described in my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Data_Center_Interconnects">Data Center Interconnects webinar</a> (and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321753887/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cisioshinandt-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=0321753887">Scalability Rules</a> book), the only solution that really works is a scale-out application architecture combined with load balancers.</p>
