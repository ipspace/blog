<p>I spent a lot of time during the last year analyzing various <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Data_Center_Fabric_Architectures_(Descriptions)">data center architectures</a> proposed by networking vendors – from simple solutions like <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/search?q=MLAG">MLAG</a> to complex architectures like <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/search?q=QFabric">QFabric</a> – and presented the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/10/data-center-fabric-architectures.html">summary of my findings</a> in a short presentation @ <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/10/euronog-2011-nerdy-heaven.html">EuroNOG 2011</a> that received positive feedback from <a href="http://twitter.com/CiscoSwitching/status/121658412613382144">Cisco</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/JuniperNetworks/status/121635966493540352">Juniper</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/TheRealLisaC/status/121717624483749888">Brocade</a> (and a <a href="http://ethernetfabric.com/2011/10/fabric-architectures-overview/">post from Brook Reams @ EthernetFabric</a>). That presentation (you can <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/10/data-center-fabric-architectures.html">view it online</a>) was pretty short due to the 45-minute slot I got and I decided to expand it into a proper 2-to-3 hour webinar.<!--more--></p>
<p>The webinar will expand the topics of the presentation and focus on numerous important aspects of modern data center architectures, including layer-2 and layer-3 multipathing, lossless transport (DCB), VM awareness, and FCoE support. I’m planning to include a score sheet for every solution describing how well it actually supports all the above-mentioned requirements.</p>
<p>So far, I’m planning to cover the following vendors and solutions (in alphabetic order): Arista EOS, Avaya/Nortel (SPB and SMLT), Brocade (VCS fabric and Multi-Chassis trundling), Cisco (VSS, vPC, FabricPath, port extenders), Force10 (FTOS and HyperLink), HP (IRF), and Juniper (QFabric, Virtual Chassis, XRE).</p>
