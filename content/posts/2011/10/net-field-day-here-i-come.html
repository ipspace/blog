<p>After more than a year, I’m back in California, anxiously waiting to meet my fellow bloggers and ask some tough questions to a fantastic lineup of vendors presenting at <a href="http://techfieldday.com/2011/nfd2/">Net Field Day 2011</a>. Stephen Foskett’s well-oiled organizing machinery is already in full gear; I’m typing this post from a WiFi-equiped car that picked me up @ SFO airport (you see, dear vendors, it’s so easy to make my inner geek happy ... all I need are some fantastic features that are actually usable and work as well as this WiFi connection).<!--more--></p>
<p>The vendors we’ll see during the next few days include fabric heavyweights Brocade, Cisco and Juniper (in alphabetical order), OpenFlow-focused NEC, our good friends Force10 (now with the Dell logo) and two unknowns: Embrane and Gigamon. I’m positive they’ll surprise me (then unknowns picked by Stephen and Greg Ferro usually do).</p>
<p>So, I’m looking forward to two fantastic days jam-packed with geekiness, technical deep dives (hopefully no Gartner or IDC quotes) and awesome conversations. Hey, and you know what – join us. NFD presentations will be streamed live over the Internet; or you could follow the <a href="http://twitter.com/techfieldday">NFD delegates</a> or #TechFieldDay tag on Twitter.</p>
