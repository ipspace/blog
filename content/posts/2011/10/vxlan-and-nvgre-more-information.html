title: VXLAN and NVGRE – more information
url: /2011/10/vxlan-and-nvgre-more-information.html
---

<p>There’s so much great material being written on VXLAN and NVGRE that I decided to write a separate post listing the best of it (if you still can’t decide whether you should care about VXLAN, <a href="http://vnetintro.eventbrite.com/">register</a> for my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Introduction_to_Virtualized_Networking">Introduction to Virtual Networking</a> webinar).<!--more--></p>
<p>Omar Sultan published a three-part series on Cisco’s Data Center blog:  <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/digging-deeper-into-vxlan/">In-depth VXLAN description</a>, <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/vxlan-deep-dive-part-2-looking-at-the-options/">Comparison with OTV, MAC-in-GRE and LISP</a> and <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/digging-deeper-in-vxlan-pt-3-more-faqs/">More FAQ</a> (including relationship between VN-Tag and VXLAN). The information in these posts is pretty much spot-on and accurate.</p>
<p>Denton Gentry @ Coding Relic wrote another great series: <a href="http://codingrelic.geekhold.com/2011/09/care-and-feeding-of-vxlan.html">Introduction</a>, <a href="http://codingrelic.geekhold.com/2011/09/vxlan-part-deux.html">Encapsulation and Learning</a>, and <a href="http://codingrelic.geekhold.com/2011/09/vxlan-conclusion.html">Transition and Gateways</a>. He also did a deep dive (as far as one could go given the current fuzzy state of the pseudo-draft) on <a href="http://codingrelic.geekhold.com/2011/10/nvgre-musings.html">NVGRE</a> (I simply couldn’t be bothered after figuring out how much of the real stuff is still missing).</p>
<p>Martin Casado <a href="http://networkheresy.wordpress.com/2011/10/03/nvgre-vlxan-and-what-microsoft-is-doing-right/">eloquently pointed to the elephant in the room</a> – lack of control plane – and suggested (what else) OpenFlow as the solution (it’s also nice to see you can get bonus points by not figuring out what needs to be done).</p>
<p>Last but definitely not least, there are two masterpieces from vendors <del>marketing departments to make you laugh</del>: HP claims <a href="http://h30507.www3.hp.com/t5/HP-Networking/VXLAN-consider-the-network-virtualization-technology-cost-angle/ba-p/99211">VXLAN uses more power than EVB</a> (no wonder, as the latter probably only works in PowerPoint) while <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/dell-blogs/enterprise/b/tech-center/archive/2011/09/27/dell-s-approach-to-network-virtualization.aspx">Dell promises to support VXLAN, NVGRE, OpenFlow</a> and unicorn tears.</p>
<p class="update">Vishwas Manral rightfully pointed out that he does not work in HP marketing. Fixed the last paragraph.</p>
