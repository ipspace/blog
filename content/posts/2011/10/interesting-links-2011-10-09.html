<p>I was overloaded during the last few weekends and my Inbox is yet again overflowing with links to excellent content. For a warm-up, look at the <a href="http://etherealmind.com/poster-eight-levels-vendor-acceptance/">eight levels of vendor acceptance</a> (a side effect of a really tough lab test during the <a href="/2011/10/euronog-2011-nerdy-heaven.html">EuroNOG 2011</a> conference).</p>
<p>On a more serious note, the most useful article of this week is probably the <a href="http://bgpmon.net/bgpmonapi.php">BGPmon Web Services API</a> that describes how you can query the global BGP table through whois or SOAP.<!--more--></p>
<h4>Data Center and virtualization</h4><p>Chris Marget shares some <a href="http://www.fragmentationneeded.net/2011/10/vmware-vswitch-nuggets-for-network.html">very interesting IGMP-related vSwitch behavior</a>. The number of kludges they implemented to avoid deploying standard bridging code is astounding.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fragmentationneeded.net/2011/09/bfd-funny-business-on-nexus.html">BFD seems to be implemented on physical ports on the Nexus 7000</a>, so it works great on P2P L3 interfaces, but not so well on VLAN interfaces.</p>
<p><a href="http://devcentral.f5.com/weblogs/macvittie/archive/2011/09/21/the-real-news-is-not-that-facebook-serves-up-1.aspx">The real news is not that Facebook servers 1 trillion pages per month</a> ... but how many requests they have to process internally to generate that content. </p>
<p><a href="http://devcentral.f5.com/weblogs/macvittie/archive/2011/09/19/it-has-shot-itself-in-the-foot.aspx">IT has shot itself in the foot</a>. Another spot-on article from <a href="http://devcentral.f5.com/weblogs/macvittie/Default.aspx">Lori MacVittie</a>. </p>
<p>Jonathan Hudson wrote an interesting article <a href="http://ethernetfabric.com/2011/10/why-can%E2%80%99t-we-all-just-get-along/">comparing the current TRILL/SPB debate to the old IS-IS/OSPF religious wars</a>. He’s right, but he just might be defending an evolutionary dead end. With MAC-over-IP (or IP-over-IP) virtual networking (VXLAN and NVGRE) being introduced in enterprise data centers, the need for large-scale bridging is gone.</p>
<h4>Cloudy skies</h4><p><a href="http://datacenteroverlords.com/2011/09/28/automation-conundrum/">Automation conundrum</a> – a good look at what we actually need to implement blah blah cloud infrastructure. Bonus points for introducing <em>cloudwashing</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://it20.info/2011/09/amazon-netflix-standard-cloud-apis-and-the-inevitable-lock-in/">Amazon, Netflix, Standard Cloud APIs and the Inevitable Lock-in</a>. Until we get a standard cloud API (not likely for at least a few years), we’ll face the same problem we’ve been facing with databases (or networks) for the last 30 years – whenever you want to use an interesting feature, you have to tie your implementation to a specific vendor’s products.</p>
<p><a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/9/21/5-scalability-poisons-and-3-cloud-scalability-antidotes.html">5 Scalability Poisons And 3 Cloud Scalability Antidotes</a> – another great scalability 101 recipe. If you want to outgrow the “mission-critical” craplications, start reading the <a href="http://highscalability.com/">High Scalability blog</a> – it has plenty of excellent links to stuff that really matters.</p>
<p>Another scalability success story: <a href="http://blog.rightscale.com/2011/09/20/rightscale-launches-3-millionth-server/">RightScale has launched its 3 millionth server</a>. In totally unrelated news, some people are forced to migrate running VMs between data centers to implement <a href="/2011/09/long-distance-vmotion-for-disaster.html">disaster avoidance</a> for “<a href="/2011/02/what-exactly-makes-something-mission.html">mission critical</a>” application.</p>
<h4>IPv6</h4><p>Paul Gear nicely exposed <a href="http://libertysys.com.au/blog/nat-is-evil-but-not-bad">many things we take for granted in the IPv4 world that will be gone in NAT-less IPv6 world</a>. Yeah, it will be an interesting journey.</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.ripe.net/Members/gih/routing-ipv6-in-2011">Routing IPv6 in 2011</a> – looks like the IPv6 BGP table explosion won’t be as bad as I thought it would be.</p>
<h4>Security</h4><p><a href="http://dubinko.info/blog/2011/09/27/take-the-facebook-challenge/">Take the Facebook challenge</a> – point facebook.com to 127.0.0.1 in your /etc/hosts, start a local web server (for logging purposes only) and watch in horror all the referrers in the server logs.</p>
<p><a href="http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/dhs-thinks-some-scada-problems-are-too-big-call-bug-092611">Changing bugs into fads (Functions-as-Designed)</a> – if you have too many problems, you simply declare they are not bugs but design features. Great job, DHS.</p>
<h4>Other</h4><p><a href="http://www.netcordia.com/community/blogs/terrys_blog/archive/2011/09/29/application-analysis-using-tcp-retransmissions-part-1.aspx">Application Analysis Using TCP Retransmissions, Part 1</a> ... interesting. Part 2 (buffering) should be even better.</p>
