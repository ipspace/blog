<p>As expected, the demand for the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core">Building IPv6 Core webinar</a> is slowly diminishing – those ISPs that know what IPv6 is all about are already implementing it. The session on March 10<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 80%;">th</span> is thus the last live session in the first half of 2011; if you’d like to attend a live session, now is the time to <a href="http://spipv6.eventbrite.com/">register</a> for it.</p>
<p>Please note that the webinar is not going away: you’ll still be able to <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Recordings">buy the webinar recording</a> or watch the recordings as part of the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Subscription">yearly subscription package</a>.</p>
