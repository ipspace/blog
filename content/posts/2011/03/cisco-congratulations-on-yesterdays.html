<p><a href="http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2011/prod_033011.html">Cisco’s Data Center megalaunch</a> is probably old news by now. They announced numerous new Nexus products, linecards for Catalyst 6500 (will that box ever retire?), UCS servers, tons of FCoE-related features and few extra goodies I’m most interested in (LISP and MPLS/VPN on Nexus 7000). <a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org/2011/03/30/ciscos-data-center-launch/">Scott Lowe</a> and <a href="http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/virtual_geek/2011/03/cisco-megalaunch.html">Chad Sakac</a> already wrote extensive reviews of the new products and features, so I’d just like to say: Congratulations! Well done! Keep surprising me with good news ;)</p>
