<p>One of the interesting problems I was facing in the recent weeks was multi-tenant security. Combine it with fuzzy all-encompassing vapor-based terminology and you have a perfect mix that can fit anything you want to sell. In the <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/tip/Ensuring-cloud-security-for-a-range-of-cloud-services"><em>Ensuring multi-tenant security in cloud services</em></a><em> </em>I wrote for SearchTelecom.com I tried to structure the cloudy visions a bit: let’s figure out <em>which type of service </em>we’re talking about, then we can discuss <em>what security mechanisms </em>make sense.</p>
<p>As you might expect, I find <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service#Infrastructure">IaaS</a> the most challenging as you’re bound to hit a number of roadblocks, from VLAN limitations to architectural limitations of virtual security appliances.</p>
