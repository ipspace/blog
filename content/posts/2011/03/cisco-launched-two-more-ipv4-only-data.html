title: Cisco launched two more IPv4-only Data Center products

<p>Cisco recently launched two very interesting products: <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/release/notes/Rel_5_0_3_N1_1/Nexus5000_Release_Notes_5_0_3_N1_1_1a.html#wp316417">layer-3 routing for the Nexus 5000 switch</a> and the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/vsg/sw/4_2_1_VSG_1_1/release/notes/vsg_rn.html">Virtual Security Gateway</a> (which is a fantastic solution that you’ll hear more about in my future posts). Sadly, both products support only IPv4. </p>
<p>I’m in this industry long enough to understand the need for “baby steps” and “focusing on what customers want” (and I know there are hundreds of great engineers within Cisco who know what needs to be done, but still have to read blog posts like this one), but launching critical products without IPv6 support after the IPv4 global address pool has already been depleted definitely doesn’t look futuristic (just for fun, you might want to watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCCgVh8wFdA">John Chambers talking about Cisco’s IPv6 thought leadership</a>).</p>
<!--more--><p>Color-coded systems (like <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/files/programs/Copy_of_press_release_0046.shtm">this one</a>) seem to be popular, so here’s my current understanding of Cisco’s IPv6 Data Center readiness in  (mostly rosy) vivid colors:</p>
<style>  td.ok { background-color: #C0FFC0; }   td.some { background-color: #FFE8C0; }   td.fail { background-color: #FFC0C0; }   #v6DC tr th,#v6DC tr td { padding: 4px 6px; } </style><table class="codeTable" id="v6DC"><tr><th>Functionality</th><th>IPv6 readiness state</th></tr><tr> <td>Routers</td> <td class="ok">All WAN edge routers are IPv6 ready</td></tr><tr> <td rowspan="2">Switches</td> <td class="ok">Catalyst 6500, Nexus 7000</td></tr><tr> <td class="fail">Nexus 5000 (no IPv6 routing), Nexus 1000V (no IPv6 PACL)</td></tr><tr> <td rowspan="3">Firewalls</td> <td class="ok">ASA</td></tr><tr> <td class="some">FWSM handles IPv6 on main CPU.

No stateful NAT64 support.</td></tr><tr> <td>WAN optimization</td> <td class="fail">IPv6 not supported</td></tr></table><p>Have I missed something? Is the table incorrect? Please let me know!</p>
