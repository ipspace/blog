title: Delegated IPv6 prefixes – RADIUS configuration
url: /2011/03/delegated-ipv6-prefixes-radius.html
---

<p>In the <em><a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Large_IPv6_Service_Provider_Networks">Building Large IPv6 Service Provider Networks</a></em> webinar I described how Cisco IOS uses two RADIUS requests to authenticate an IPv6 user</a> (request#1) and get the delegated prefix (request#2). The second request is sent with a modified username (<strong>-dhcpv6</strong> is appended to the original username) and an empty password (the fact that is conveniently glossed over in all Cisco documentation I found).</p>
<p><a href="http://freeradius.org/">FreeRADIUS server</a> is smart enough to bark at an empty password, to force the RADIUS server to accept a username with no password you have to use <strong>Auth-Type := Accept</strong>:</p>
<pre class="code">Site-A-dhcpv6   Auth-Type := Accept<br/>        cisco-avpair = "ipv6:prefix#1=fec0:1:2400:1100::/56"</pre><!--more--><p>Having a username without a password in your RADIUS database is obviously a huge security hole – anyone can use that username to authenticate PPP sessions or log into your router. When Kurt (<a href="http://twitter.com/networkjanitor">@networkjanitor</a>) Bales stumbled across a similar problem, the first solution he proposed was to use a different set of RADIUS servers for login authentication, but then he wrote a great blog post <a href="http://www.network-janitor.net/2011/01/radius-auth-type-attribute/">describing how you can use additional check items in FreeRADIUS user definitions to ensure a PPP username can never be used for an interactive login session</a>.</p>
<p>FreeRADIUS provides a variety of check items you can use, including <em>lack of an attribute </em>in the incoming request. As RADIUS requests used to get delegated IPv6 prefix have no other attributes but modified username and empty password, I was able to use the absence of other attributes to generate a somewhat foolproof user entry that could not be used for anything but IPv6 prefix delegation:</p>
<pre class="code">Site-A-dhcpv6   Service-Type !* any, NAS-Port-Id !* any, Auth-Type := Accept<br/>        cisco-avpair = "ipv6:prefix#1=fec0:1:2400:1100::/56"</pre><div class="note"><p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>The <strong>!*</strong> syntax indicates the attribute must not be present in RADIUS request. The value of the attribute is ignored.</li>
<li><em>Service-Type</em> RADIUS attribute indicates the type of service the RADIUS client (the router) is authenticating.</li>
<li>Cisco IOS does not include <em>Service-Type</em> attribute when authenticating interactive users. Those requests do include <em>NAS-Port-Id</em> attribute.</li>
</ul>
