<h4>Tip-of-the-week</h4><p>The Tip-of-the-Week award goes to Jeremy (@packetlife) Stretch for his excellent <a href="http://packetlife.net/wiki/tips-starting-it-blog/"><em>Tips for starting an IT blog</em></a><em> </em>advice. He’s also experimenting with a <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2011/mar/25/delayed-blog-feed-available/">three-year-delayed blog feed</a>. Marvelous idea, I have to do something similar.</p>
<h4>IPv6</h4><p>Shortly after my <em><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/03/wheres-my-aaaa-record.html">Where's my AAAA record</a></em> post, RIPE Labs published an <a href="http://labs.ripe.net/Members/emileaben/6to4-why-is-it-so-bad">excellent explanation of the broken-IPv6 phenomena</a>. Most of the problems are caused by 6to4 tunnels; obviously it’s time to get rid of them (but unfortunately they’re built into operating systems like Windows Vista).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/">Geoff Huston</a> published a two-part series on transitioning to IPv6. Part 1 describes <a href="http://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2011-02/transtools-part1.html">dual stack and tunnels</a> and part 2 focuses on <a href="http://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2011-03/transtools-part2.html">Service Provider technologies like CGN, DS-Lite, 6rd and 6PE</a>.</p>
<p>Jason Braddy posted an interesting link in one of the comments to my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/03/ipv6-enabling-your-legacy-applications.html">IPv6-to-IPv4 load balancing post</a>: check out Zeus Traffic Manager; supposedly it can <a href="http://knowledgehub.zeus.com/articles/2008/07/04/getting_your_website_up_and_running_on_i">rewrite web pages on-the-fly</a>.</p>
