title: Framed-IPv6-Prefix used as delegated DHCPv6 prefix

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/chrisionetworks">Chris Pollock</a> from <a href="http://www.ionetworks.com.au/">io Networks</a> was kind enough to share yet another method of implementing DHCPv6 prefix delegation on PPP interfaces in his comment to my <a href="/2011/03/dhcpv6-radius-integration-cisco-way/"><em>DHCPv6-RADIUS integration: the Cisco way</em></a> blog post: if you tell the router not to use the <em>Framed-IPv6-Prefix </em>passed from RADIUS in the list of prefixes advertised in RA messages with the <strong>no ipv6 nd prefix framed-ipv6-prefix</strong> interface configuration command, the router uses the prefix sent from the RADIUS server as delegated prefix.</p>
<p class="warn">This setup works reliably in IOS release 15.0M. 12.2SRE3 (running on a 7206) includes the <em>framed-IPv6-prefix </em>in RA advertisements <em>and </em>DHCPv6 IA_PD reply, totally confusing the CPE.</p>
<!--more--><p>This feature works great for CPE routers connecting to the PE-router (BRAS), but if the PPP session is established directly from an end host, the host still needs an IPv6 prefix on the PPP link itself, so you have to address the virtual access interfaces from a local IPv6 address pool. Complete configuration of the virtual template interface is included below:</p>
<pre class="code">interface Virtual-Template10<br/> mtu 1480<br/> no ip address<br/> peer default ipv6 pool PPP<br/> ipv6 enable<br/> no ipv6 nd prefix framed-ipv6-prefix<br/> ipv6 nd other-config-flag<br/> no ipv6 nd ra suppress<br/> ipv6 dhcp server PPP-Radius<br/> no keepalive<br/> ppp authentication pap<br/> ppp direction callin</pre><p>You have to configure an IPv6 DHCP pool to be able to start DHCP server on the virtual access interface. The DHCP pool needs just the DNS server address:</p>
<pre class="code">ipv6 dhcp pool PPP-Radius<br/> dns-server FEC0::CCCC:4</pre><p>Last but not least, you need a local IPv6 address pool:</p>
<pre class="code">ipv6 local pool PPP FEC0:1:2300::/48 64</pre><p>... and a corresponding route to <em>null </em>interface that you can advertise into your IGP or BGP:</p>
<pre class="code">ipv6 route FEC0:1:2300::/48 Null0</pre><h4>More information</h4><p>Using <em>Framed-IPv6-Prefix </em>as delegated DHCPv6 prefix is only one of the many ways you can configure DHCPv6 prefix delegation on Cisco IOS. Most of them, including local DHCPv6 server, DHCPv6 relay, proprietary RADIUS integration with two usernames and RFC 4818 are described in my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core"><em>Building IPv6 Service Provider Core</em></a> webinar.</p>
