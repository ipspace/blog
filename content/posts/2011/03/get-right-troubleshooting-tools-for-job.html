title: Get the right troubleshooting tools for the job

<p>A while ago Matthew Norwood wrote an excellent article <a href="http://networktherapy.wordpress.com/2011/01/15/programming-bad-performance/">describing the troubleshooting process they used to figure out why a particular web application worked way too slowly</a>. Greg Ferro was quick to point out that it <a href="http://etherealmind.com/perception-is-reality/">doesn’t make sense to assume the network is the problem</a> and work through the whole chain slowly eliminating every potential networking device as the source of the problem when you might be facing an application design issue. However, there’s an even more important consideration: your network troubleshooting toolbox lacks the right troubleshooting tools for this job.</p>
<!--more--><p>Loading a web page is a complex process that can generate tens of individual requests, sometimes going to the same server, sometimes spread over a number of CDN elements. Some requests block other requests (two JavaScript files cannot be loading at the same time), some requests block page rendering (the rendering will not start until all CSS files have been loaded). Before trying to analyze the individual components that can marginally influence the response time of <em>each individual HTTP request </em>it makes sense to look at the big picture: <em>how many requests</em> is the web page generating?</p>
<p>Some of the browsers have all the tools you need already built in:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>In Chrome, open the <em>Developer Tools </em>by right-clicking anywhere on the page and selecting <em>Inspect element.</em> The <em>Network </em>tab in the pop-up window gives you the request timeline.</li>
<li>In Safari, you have to enable development tools in advanced preferences. After that, you can show <em>Web Inspector</em> from the <em>Develop </em>menu and enable resource tracking in the <em>Resources </em>tab.</li>
<li>In Firefox, use the <em>Firebug </em>plug-in; you’ll find the timeline in the <em>Net </em>tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to use a standalone browser-independent tool, download <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">Fiddler</a>, a proxy HTTP server that runs on your workstation, logs all HTTP requests and allows you to see them as a timeline or analyze each one of them. </p>
<p>Regardless of the tool you use, the HTTP request/response timeline gives you a quick insight into web application behavior. For example, compare the redesigned Cisco’s home page to Microsoft’s:</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="/2011/03/s1600-FiddlerCisco.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="151" src="/2011/03/s320-FiddlerCisco.png" width="320"/></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/2011/03/s1600-FiddlerMicrosoft.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="274" src="/2011/03/s320-FiddlerMicrosoft.png" width="320"/></a></div>
<p>After you’ve identified the main culprit (too many HTTP requests or slow response to individual HTTP requests), you can either send the application developers back to the drawing board or investigate individual requests. Most tools allow you to select an individual request from the timeline to inspect the details (in Fiddler, select the <em>statistics </em>tab). Here’s a sample printout from one of my applications where the server does a lot of SQL work before returning the response data.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/2011/03/s1600-FiddlerRequest.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="260" src="/2011/03/s320-FiddlerRequest.png" width="320"/></a></div>
<p>As you can see, you can analyze network latency (TCP connect time), server response time (delta time between <em>ServerGotRequest </em>and <em>ServerBeginResponse</em>), transfer time (between <em>ServerBeginResponse </em>and <em>ServerDoneResponse</em>) and local processing time (between <em>ServerDoneResponse </em>and <em>ClientDoneResponse</em>), yet again giving you the data you need to decide whether to go into network, server or application performance troubleshooting.</p>
