title: Does Bridge Assurance make UDLD obsolete?

<p>I got an interesting question from Andrew: “<em>Would you say that </em><a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12.2SX/configuration/guide/stp_enha.html#Understanding_Bridge_Assurance"><em>bridge assurance</em></a><em> makes UDLD unnecessary? It doesn't seem clear from any resource I've found so far (either on Cisco's docs or on Google).</em>” </p>
<p>It’s important to remember that UDLD works on <em>physical links </em>whereas bridge assurance works <em>on top of STP </em>(which also implies it works above link aggregation/port channel mechanisms). UDLD can detect individual link failure (even when the link is part a LAG); bridge assurance can detect unaggregated link failures, total LAG failure, misconfigured remote port or a malfunctioning switch.</p>
<!--more--><p>Some of the reasons you might want to prefer UDLD would thus include:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>UDLD can detect link problems even when you disable spanning tree (for example, on layer-2 data center interconnect links);</li>
<li>If you cannot use <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/bfd/">BFD</a>, you can run UDLD on routed interfaces to detect link problems faster than the routing protocol hello mechanisms would;</li>
<li>You can run UDLD on individual ports of a static port channel (for example, redundant ports in a layer-2 DCI).</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefits of Bridge Assurance are also obvious: </p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>It can detect STP configuration problems;</li>
<li>You can use it in a mixed-vendor environment, whereas you can use UDLD only between a pair of Cisco’s switches. </li>
</ul>
<p>In complex designs, you’ll probably end up using both.</p>
