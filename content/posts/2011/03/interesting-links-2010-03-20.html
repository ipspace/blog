<h4>Advice of the Week</h4><p>Straight from Scott Adams: true to his (and Dilbert’s) nature, he writes about <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/happiness_engineering/">Happiness Engineering</a>.</p>
<h4>Virtualization</h4><p>Brad Hedlund is back from the corporate overload writing about <a href="http://bradhedlund.com/2011/03/16/inverse-virtualization-for-internet-scale-applications/">inverse virtualization</a> (isn’t that a great name for a server farm – Brad has some serious future in corporate marketing if he ever decides to change jobs again ;)</p>
<!--more--><p>If you’re interested in vShield, VMware’s attempt to enter network security market, start with <a href="http://vsphere-land.com/news/my-new-series-on-the-vmware-vshield-product-family.html">Eric Siebert’s series</a>. After you get totally confused by VMware’s product names and packaging tricks, read the <a href="http://it20.info/2011/03/vshield-products-packaging-explained-with-a-focus-on-vcloud-director/">vShield Product Packaging Explained</a> article by Massimo Re Ferre.</p>
<p>Lori MacVittie has written another great article, this time arguing that it’s time to <a href="http://devcentral.f5.com/weblogs/macvittie/archive/2011/03/04/f5-friday-the-evolution-of-reference-architectures-to-repeatable-architectures.aspx">move from reference architectures to repeatable architectures</a>.</p>
<h4>IPv6</h4><p>In an amazing case of synchronized thinking, Jeff Doyle published his <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/case-enterprise-ipv6?source=nww_rss"><em>The Case for Enterprise IPv6</em></a> article at almost the same time as I wrote my <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/03/you-cant-ignore-ipv6-any-longer-in.html"><em>You can’t ignore IPv6 any longer</em></a> post.</p>
<p>RIPE NCC has published <a href="http://www.ripe.net/training/material/IPv6-for-LIRs-Training-Course/IPv6_addr_plan4.pdf"><em>Preparing an IPv6 Address Plan</em></a> document, documenting some of the best practices you can use to carve /64 prefixes out of your /48 chunk of public address space (you did get a PI chunk, right?)</p>
<p>In my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/EnterpriseIPv6">Enterprise IPv6 webinar</a> (<a href="http://entipv6.eventbrite.com/">register here</a>), I’m always stressing that the applications will become the biggest roadblock on the path to IPv6 deployment. Russell Heilling has <a href="http://perlmonkey.blogspot.com/2011/03/monkeying-around-with-ipv6.html">recently documented another case of IPv6 denial symptom</a>: IPv6 patches for the Twisted framework have been available for over three years, but nobody cared enough to have them merged with the mainstream code. I was more fortunate: PERL, <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/new_features_2_0.html">Apache</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1196">Mediawiki</a> had IPv6 support for years.</p>
