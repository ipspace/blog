<p>A few days ago I used Google to search for an article I’d written. My article was among the top results, but there was also another web site with very similar text. I’m used to blockheads publishing content stolen from my RSS feed (which is one of the primary reasons you won’t see a full feed of my blog any time soon), but this guy seemed to be copying the whole articles ... only they sounded somewhat crazy. For example,</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Yesterday I described how the IPv6 architects split the functionality of IPCP into three different protocols (IPCPv6, RA and DHCPv6). While the split undoubtedly makes sense from the academic perspective, the service providers offering PPP-based services (including DSL and retrograde uses of PPP-over-FTTH) went berserk.  </blockquote>
<p>... became ...</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Yesterday we dеѕсrіbеd hοw thе IPv6 architects rip thе functionality οf IPCP іntο 3 odd protocols (IPCPv6, RA аnd DHCPv6). Whіlе thе rip positively mаkеѕ clarity frοm thе educational perspective, thе use providers charity PPP-based services (counting DSL аnd opposing uses οf PPP-over-FTTH) wеnt berserk.  </blockquote>
<!--more--><p>Finally it dawned on me: someone is manually copying my text, running it through a thesaurus service (or maybe doing Google translation to Elbonian and back), probably hoping to bypass detection and/or copyright issues, and publishing it as his own. Oh, and I’m in a good company: he’s also stealing from Etherealmind, Network World, Perlmonkey and a bunch of other sites. He even has the guts to steal directly from Cisco and title his site <em>Cisco Systems</em>.</p>
<p>Usually I would just ignore a scam like this, but the results are so hilarious I simply have to share them with you. Ladies and gentlemen, <a href="http://huuuh.com/" rel="nofollow">here’s the most amazing moron I’ve encountered so far</a>.</p>
