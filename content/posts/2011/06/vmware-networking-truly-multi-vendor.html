title: VMware networking – a truly multi-vendor webinar
url: /2011/06/vmware-networking-truly-multi-vendor.html
---

<p>When I started developing the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/VMnet">VMware networking webinar</a> (<a href="http://vnetwork.eventbrite.com/">register here</a>), I planned to cover VMware’s products (including vShield and vCloud Director) and Cisco’s Nexus 1000V, but then the early reviewers pointed out numerous other interesting products around vSphere:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Firewalls: HP’s TippingPoint vController, Juniper’s vGW Virtual Gateway and Cisco’s Virtual Security Gateway;</li>
<li>Access switch solutions: VM Tracer from Arista and HyperLink from Force10;</li>
<li>Virtual appliances from F5, Vyatta and Zeus.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of them are now described in the webinar (to be honest, the appliances got an honorable mention), as is Cisco’s Adapter FEX (VN-Tag), VM-FEX (VN-Link) and (to make it balanced) the EVB/VEPA standard.</p>
