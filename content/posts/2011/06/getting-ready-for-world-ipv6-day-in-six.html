<p>In a few minutes <a href="http://www.pragma.si/resume/index.html">Jan Žorž</a>, a true IPv6 evangelist, will open the <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sl&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fgo6.si%2F5-slo-ipv6-summit%2F">Fifth Slovenian IP Summit</a>. The event is focused on the World IPv6 Day and I decided to use a hypothetical case study: imagine your CIO just came back from an <a href="http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2007-05-23/">off-site social networking event</a> where everyone got all hyped up about the <a href="http://www.worldipv6day.org/">World IPv6 Day</a>. </p>
<p>Next thing you know, you’re in his office and he’s telling you the PR gurus have decided your organization simply has to participate in this revolutionary event. Assuming you haven’t invested in IPv6 yet, my presentation might serve as a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/IOSHints/getting-ready-for-world-ipv6-day-in-6-days">short survival guide</a> (hint: you have only 6 days left).</p>
