title: DMVPN New Features webinar is cancelled

<p><a href="http://www.ioshints.info/DMVPN150"><em>New DMVPN features in IOS release 15.x</em></a> is obviously a topic without a broad audience ... although Cisco did introduce some nifty new things that can help you scale a large DMVPN network or make a DMVPN network more manageable.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I had to cancel next week’s webinar. I don’t plan to have another live session in a near future, but you can still <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Recordings?code=DMVPN150">buy a recording</a> (or <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Subscription">watch it as part of the yearly subscription</a>).</p>
