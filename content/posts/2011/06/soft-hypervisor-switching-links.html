<p><a href="http://networkheresy.wordpress.com/bio/">Martin Casado</a> and his team have published a great series of blog articles describing hypervisor switching (for the VMware-focused details, check out my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/VMnet">VMware Networking Deep Dive</a>). It starts with an <a href="http://networkheresy.wordpress.com/2011/06/06/an-extremely-brief-conceptual-introduction-to-open-vswitch/">overview of Open vSwitch</a> (the open source alternative for VMware’s vSwitch, commonly used in Xen/KVM environments), describes <a href="http://networkheresy.wordpress.com/2011/06/14/the-rise-of-soft-switching-part-i-introduction-and-background/">the basics of hypervisor-based switching</a> and <a href="http://networkheresy.wordpress.com/2011/06/25/the-rise-of-soft-switching-part-ii-soft-switching-is-awesome-tm/">addresses some of the performance myths</a>. There’s also an interesting response from Intel <a href="http://networkheresy.wordpress.com/2011/06/20/sr-iov-is-not-passthrough-response-to-the-rise-of-soft-switching-part-1/">setting straight the SR-IOV facts</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>After reading all those articles, you should start wondering:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Why the heck would I need Cisco’s VN-Link (remember: it’s not the same as <a href="/2011/06/vn-tag8021qbh-basics.html">VN-Tag</a>)?</li>
<li>What is EVB bringing to the table? (hint: you might find the answer <a href="/2011/05/edge-virtual-bridging-evb-8021qbg-eases.html">here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p class="warn">As a side effect, you might also agree with me that VEPA is truly totally broken.</p>
