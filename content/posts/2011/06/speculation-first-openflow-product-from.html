<div class='update'>2021-01-03: I was totally wrong. I thought they would go for Nexus OS as OpenFlow controller, but they implemented a horrible OpenFlow agent on Nexus OS &ndash; just enough to get a tick-in-the-box in the RFP process.</div>
<p>Sometime around the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/03/open-networking-foundation-fabric.html">Open Networking Foundation launch</a>, Paul McNab  VP/CTO of the Data Center Switching and Services Group, supposedly said “<a href="http://www.itworldcanada.com/news/the-next-revolution-in-networking-is-months-away/142810">[OpenFlow] would be built into the NX-OS operating system of high end Nexus switches</a>.” A bit later, the story changed to “<a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/openflow-pulling-networking-into-the-application-stack/">I prefer not to pre-announce</a>.” As I wrote before, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/04/openflow-bios-does-not-server-make.html">I don’t think Cisco’s first move will be to implement OpenFlow API in NX7K</a> and allow third parties to replace NX-OS and/or mess up the NX7K TCAM. So what could it be?<!--more--></p>
<p>NX-OS is used in more products than just high-end Data Center switches. It’s also the control plane for Nexus 1000V and the foundation platform for the Virtual Security Gateway (VSG). Just a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/06/what-exactly-is-nexus-1000v.html">quick look at the Nexus 1000V architecture</a> tells you it’s perfectly aligned with the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/04/what-is-openflow.html">OpenFlow concepts</a>. You just have to implement controller-side OpenFlow in NX-OS and the Nexus 1000V VSM can control <a href="http://openvswitch.org/">Open vSwitch</a> (running in Xen and KVM) as well as VMware-resident VEM, giving Cisco a perfect multi-vendor hypervisor control plane solution.</p>
<p>The goodies don’t stop there. MPLS/VPN and LISP are already in the NX-OS code base (<a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/04/vcloud-architects-ever-heard-of-mpls.html">this is why at least MPLS/VPN could matter</a>) and OpenFlow 1.1.0 can already be used to implement MPLS/VPN PE-router functionality. Open vSwitch does not support that particular data structure yet, but those guys are evolving pretty quickly.</p>
<p>The support for more generic IP-in-IP, IP-in-something or MAC-in-something encapsulations that could be used to implement LISP, GRE or other IP transports are not yet part of OpenFlow protocol’s data structures, but I don’t doubt someone will shove them into the next release (after all, they are trivial to implement on software-based platforms as soon as you have L2 or L3 lookup capabilities).</p>
<p>Based on all these facts, what do you think Cisco’s first OpenFlow product will be?</p>
