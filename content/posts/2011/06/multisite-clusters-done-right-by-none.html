title: Multisite clusters done right ... by none other than Microsoft

<p>I had to check the Microsoft clustering terminology a few days ago, so I used Google to find the most relevant pages for “Windows cluster” and landed on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/failover-clustering-main.aspx"><em>Failover clustering</em></a><em> </em>home page where the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/failover-clustering-multisite.aspx"><em>Multisite Clustering</em></a><em> </em>link immediately caught my attention. Dreading the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/06/stretched-clusters-almost-as-good-as.html">humongous amount of layer-2 DCI stupidities</a> that could lurk hidden behind such a concept, I barely dared to click on the link ... which unveiled one of the most pleasant surprises I’ve got from an IT vendor in a very long time. Microsoft actually understands that some people prefer to keep their IT infrastructure stable and supported <em>multi-subnet clusters</em> for quite some time. What a revolutionary concept for the L2-crazed flat-earth world some other vendors are busy promoting.<!--more--></p>
<p>The <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947048/en-us">details of Microsoft’s multisite cluster implementation</a> made me smile (and some people know that’s a tough call) – cluster resources register their A and AAAA records with DNS (yes, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/02/another-nexus-1000v-ipv6-fail.html">contrary to some networking vendors</a>, Microsoft does support IPv6 in the data center) and there are two property settings that you can fine-tune: the DNS TTL and the registration of all (or just one) IP address. </p>
<p>The failover between subnets is completely controlled by DNS – not suitable for web servers due to browsers’ DNS pinning, but let’s hope your application architects know a scale-out approach is a better fit for a web server farm than a failover cluster. However, the DNS-based failover is a pretty good fit for other back-end services, for example the SQL server (don’t forget that a service needs to be <em>restarted </em>in a failover cluster and the restart time is significantly longer than the DNS failover time). What Microsoft does is almost exactly the same concept I was recommending in my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/DCI">Data Center Interconnects</a> webinar; the only difference is the implementation method – they use their own DNS, I recommended using local and global load balancing.</p>
<p>Assuming more OS vendors see the same light Microsoft did, the shiny new L2 DCI technologies just might land where they belong – the same technology graveyard where LANE and ATM-to-the-desktop are lovingly preserved. Oh, and whenever the application people or server administrators tell you they need L2 DCI for Windows failover clusters, tell them Microsoft solved their problem over a year ago in Windows Server <em>2008</em>.</p>
