<p>In early autumn of 2010, a “<em>DRAFT on Cisco Nexus 1000V LISP Configuration Guide</em>” appeared on CCO. It’s gone now (and unfortunately I haven’t saved a copy), but the possibilities made me really excited – with LISP in Nexus 1000V, we could do close-to-perfect vMotion over any IP infrastructure (including inter-DC vMotion that requires stretched VLANs and L2 DCI today). Here’s what I had to say on this topic during my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/DCI">Data Center Interconnect</a> webinar (<a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Recordings?code=DCI">buy a recording</a>).</p>
