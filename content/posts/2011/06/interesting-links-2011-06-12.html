<p>Article of the week: “<a href="http://networkheresy.wordpress.com/2011/06/05/what-openflow-is-and-more-importantly-what-its-not/">What OpenFlow is (and more importantly, what it’s not)</a>” by <a href="http://networkheresy.wordpress.com/bio/">Martin Casado</a>, CTO of Nicira Networks and consulting professor at Stanford. It’s so refreshing to see someone deeply involved with OpenFlow having almost the same perspective as I do.</p>
<p>Another highly relevant article: “<a href="http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/the-wrong-problem/">You’re solving the wrong problem</a>” Read it every time someone tells you to build layer-2 DC interconnects to support stretched clusters.</p>
<p>Tweet of the week: “<em>Synergizing end to end webinar verticals for maximum customer value impact!</em>” (<a href="http://twitter.com/networkjanitor">@networkjanitor</a> commenting my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Roadmap">webinar roadmaps</a>).<!--more--></p>
<p>Other good stuff (somewhat randomly):</p>
<h4>OpenFlow</h4><p><a href="http://www.openflowhub.org/wp/2011/05/why-openflow-hub/">Why OpenFlow Hub</a> – as I expected, the OpenFlow technology got hyped and commercialized too early in its development cycle. Next step: every startup will roll out totally proprietary product, all of them claiming to be able to control merchant silicon switches. Welcome back to the early 80s; Doc Brown must be so proud.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openflowhub.org/display/routeflow/RouteFlow+Home">RouteFlow</a> – some OpenFlow developers have realized there might be a marginal use for hated old-world routing protocols.</p>
<h4>IPv6</h4><p><a href="http://www.circleid.com/posts/dhcp_for_ipv4_vs_ipv6_what_you_need_to_know/">DHCP for IPv4 and IPv6</a> – nice high-level overview of their differences.</p>
<p><a href="http://pktmaniac.info/2011/04/lisp-ipv6-over-ipv4-transition/">IPv6 over IPv4 transition with LISP</a> – another fantastic must-read article by Yandy the Packet Maniac.</p>
<h4>Fog, clouds and other meteorological events</h4><p>VMware published <a href="http://www.vmware.com/cloud-computing/cloud-architecture/">vCloud Architecture Toolkit</a> document.</p>
<h4>Other</h4><p><a href="http://dankaminsky.com/2011/06/09/securid/">On The RSA SecurID Compromise</a> – great analysis by Dan Kaminsky.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.paulmyoung.net/2011/06/beware-cult-of-roi.html">Beware the cult of ROI</a> – like any other cargo cult, cult of ROI might be dangerous if pursued by the pointy-haired individuals.</p>
<p><a href="http://lonesysadmin.net/2011/06/03/why-bring-your-own-device-is-seriously-flawed/">Why “Bring Your Own Device” Is Seriously Flawed</a>. Bob Plankers obviously has to deal with BYOD-induced stupidities on a daily basis. This article is full of well thought-out arguments against lemming-like BYOD rollout.</p>
