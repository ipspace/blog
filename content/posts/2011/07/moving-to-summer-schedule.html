<p>My web site statistics are (yet again) confirming the inevitable truth: the holiday season has started in the northern hemisphere. I hope you’ll be busy doing things that are more fun than reading my blog, so I’ll publish only two or three articles per week to prevent information overload, returning to the regular daily schedule in late August. </p>
