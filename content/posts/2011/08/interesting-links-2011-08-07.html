<p>Accumulated in my Inbox during the second half of July:</p>
<h4>Virtualization</h4><p>Duncan Epping wrote a long series of posts describing the new VMware’s High Availability implementation: <a href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2011/07/22/ha-architecture-series-fdm-15/">Fault domain manager</a>, <a href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2011/07/25/ha-architecture-series-primary-nodes-25/">Primary nodes</a>, <a href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2011/07/26/ha-architecture-series-datastore-heartbeating-35/">Datastore heartbeating</a>, <a href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2011/07/27/ha-architecture-series-restarting-vms-45/">Restarting VMs</a> and finally <a href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2011/07/28/ha-architecture-series-advanced-settings-55/">Advanced settings</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>Jason Nash wrote a <a href="http://www.trainsignaltraining.com/vsphere-vshield">nice overview of various vShield products</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://it20.info/2009/12/from-scale-up-vs-scale-out-to-scale-down/">From Scale Up to Scale Down</a> – a bit older but still extremely relevant article from Massimo Re Ferre (more so with after the vTax launch).</p>
<h4>Data centers</h4><p>Derick Winkworth is <a href="http://blinking-network.blogspot.com/2011/07/why-juniper-should-worry-about-ciscos.html">even more enthusiastic about MPLS support on NX-OS</a> than I am. </p>
<p>Joe Onisick argues that <a href="http://www.definethecloud.net/why-fcoe-standards-matter">FCoE standards and interoperability matter</a>. I totally agree with him, but still feel a bit like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote">this gentleman</a>.</p>
<p>Yandy Ramirez made an interesting discovery: <a href="http://pktmaniac.info/2011/07/nexus-two-way-vpc-good-to-know/">bridge assurance doesn’t work on vPC-based port channels</a> as only one Nexus in the vPC pair receives incoming STP BPDUs.</p>
<p><a href="http://nerdtwilight.wordpress.com/2011/07/19/cisco-the-merchant-silicon-question/">Yet another article on Cisco and merchant silicon</a> from the <em>Twilight in the valley of nerds</em>.</p>
<p>Seems like we are about to have an open networking trilogy: <a href="http://openvswitch.org/topics/openstack/">OpenStack</a> has joined OpenFlow and Open vSwitch.</p>
<p><a href="http://devcentral.f5.com/weblogs/macvittie/archive/2011/07/26/web-2-and-cloud-make-paas-middleware-obsolete.aspx">Web 2.0 killed the middleware star</a> - Lori MacVittie describes why the middleware is no longer as relevant as it’s been a decade ago.</p>
<h4>IP routing</h4><p>Chris Marget wrote a nice article describing how <a href="http://www.fragmentationneeded.net/2011/07/black-holes-in-ospf-topology.html">asynchronous convergence in different OSPF areas can impact the network</a>.</p>
<h4>Security</h4><p>I usually say that those that don’t know history tend to repeat old mistakes (resurrection of large-scale bridging comes to mind); Robert Graham has a similar (but slightly different) perspective – <a href="http://erratasec.blogspot.com/2011/07/those-who-dont-know-state-of-art-are.html">those that don’t know the state of the art will reinvent the wheel</a>. I know absolutely nothing about IDS/IPS technology, but he also seems to imply HP TippingPoint is not really the shining star HP is claiming it to be.</p>
<h4>Other</h4><p><a href="http://www.zoion.com/~erlkonig/writings/programmer-beekeeping.html">How software companies die</a>. Published in 1995 but still relevant.</p>
<p>Chuck Hollis is expanding his topics – <a href="http://chucksblog.emc.com/chucks_blog/2011/07/a-tale-of-two-economies.html">this time into economy</a>. Interesting reading.</p>
<p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6305">RFC 6305 – I’m being attacked by PRISONER.IANA.ORG</a>. The lapses some people make are astounding. This RFC deals with those that try to map internal RFC 1918 addresses to hostnames using public DNS servers.</p>
