<p>Some of my African readers couldn’t buy the yearly webinar subscription in the past due to variety of credit card-related problems. I spent a few days with NIL Africa’s wonderful team after a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/08/quotes-of-week.html">fun consulting engagement</a> that brought me to South Africa ... and managed to find a solution – get in touch with <a href="http://www.itweb.co.za/office/nil/contacts.htm">Lefkia Swart @ NIL Africa</a> and she’ll send you an invoice. </p>
