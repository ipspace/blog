<p>Most persuasive argument of the week: “<a href="http://www.commcham.com/traffic-charges"><em>Are traffic charges needed to avert a coming capex catastrophe?</em></a>” by Robert Kenny. This is how you rebut the claims of the greedy Service Providers (and their hired guns), not by hysterical screaming and spitting perfected by some net neutrality zealots.</p>
<p>Most insightful talk: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVs7Pc99S7w"><em>An Attempt to Motivate and Clarify Software-Defined Networking</em></a><em> </em>by Scott Shenker. While he’s <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/handwave.html">handwaving</a> across a lot of details, the framework does make sense. <!--more--></p>
<p>The prime example of eloquent blah blah cloud poetry I came across lately: <a href="http://www.definethecloud.net/the-need-to-design-for-workload-mobility-in-the-cloud-dr-and-roi-considerations"><em>The Need to Design for Workload Mobility in the Cloud: DR and ROI Considerations</em></a>. Now I know who’s pushing the idea of inter-DC VM mobility: the consultants who need new engagements (and vendors who are keen to sell new gear).</p>
<p>BTW, anyone who manages to mention 100% available environments and the need for VM mobility to implement them has just proven he has no clue what he’s talking about ... see <a href="/2011/08/high-availability-fallacies.html">HA fallacies</a> for more details. The only one way to get more nines is still the same: scale-out applications with redundant local and global load balancing (or significant change in the TCP stack).</p>
<p>And here are the other links that accumulated in my Inbox:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Are you ready for IPv6 – <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary.html?storyid=11317">part 1</a> and <a href="http://isc.sans.edu/diary.html?storyid=11416">part 2</a>. Getting IPv6 routing and packet forwarding up and running is just part of the solution.</li>
<li><a href="http://datacenteroverlords.com/2011/08/19/multi-path-ethernet-the-flying-cars-of-the-data-center/">Multi-path Ethernet and the flying cars</a>. I love the analogy and still hope that the whole thing will <a href="/2011/08/imagine-ruckus-when-hypervisor-vendors.html">quickly become irrelevant</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/08/new_undeletable.html">Undeletable web cookie</a>. Nasty. The scary part is that it’s so simple to implement (I had working code for years as I had to solve user-specific caching behavior).</li>
<li><a href="http://packetpushers.net/cisco-6500-sort-of-gets-multichassis-lacp-without-vss-in-12-2sxj-train/">MLAG Lite (active/passive LACP) on a pair of 6500s without VSS</a>. Sort-of interesting ... maybe.</li>
<li><a href="http://devcentral.f5.com/weblogs/macvittie/archive/2011/07/08/infrastructure-scalability-pattern-sharding-streams.aspx">Another sharding idea from F5</a>. I’m always amazed by what modern load balancers can do.</li>
</ul>
