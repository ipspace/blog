<p>I’ve spent the last few days with a fantastic group of highly skilled networking engineers (can’t share the details, but you know who you are) discussing the topics I like most: BGP, MPLS, MPLS Traffic Engineering and IPv6 in Service Provider environment.  </p>
<p>One of the problems we were trying to solve was a clean split of a POP into two sites, retaining redundancy without adding too much extra equipment. The strive for maximum redundancy nudged me to propose the unimaginable: layer-2 interconnect between four tightly controlled routers running BGP, but even that got shot down with a memorable quote from the senior network architect:<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite">I would always prefer slightly reduced redundancy over increased failure domain.</blockquote>
<p>In the end, we figured out that without the layer-2 interconnect our design can’t survive a particular rare combination of two simultaneous failures, but even there we found a workaround that allowed us to retain slightly reduced functionality after a total failure of those two critical components without resorting to stretched subnets. As they say, where there’s will, there’s way.</p>
<p>During the evenings we kept discussing various “interesting” scenarios we’ve seen in the past, including people who tried to cram way too many features into a single router (like trying to run <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/04/l2tp-revenge-of-hardware-switching.html">IPSec and L2TP inside a VRF in an ASR</a> or VTI-over-DMVPN on a 2900). I will definitely use the very short explanation I got in some future discussions:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">People need to understand that even though they have a Swiss army knife, they can’t use all of its features at the same time.</blockquote>

<p>And the last one probably needs no introductory context:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">You need high pressure to get diamonds. Without it, you’re left with coal.</blockquote>
