title: 'VXLAN: MAC-over-IP-based vCloud networking'

<p>In one of my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/11/vcloud-disruptiveness-nothing-new.html">vCloud Director Networking Infrastructure rants</a> I wrote “<em>if they had decided to use IP encapsulation, I would have applauded.</em>” It’s time to applaud: Cisco has just demonstrated Nexus 1000V supporting MAC-over-IP encapsulation for vCloud Director isolated networks at VMworld, solving at least <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/04/vcloud-director-networking.html">some of the scalability problems MAC-in-MAC encapsulation has</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/06/what-exactly-is-nexus-1000v.html">Nexus 1000V VEM</a> will be able to (once the new release becomes available) encapsulate MAC frames generated by virtual machines residing in isolated segments into UDP packets exchanged between VEMs. <!--more--></p>
<p>The MAC-in-IP encapsulation seems to be based on the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan-00">VXLAN draft</a> (released just a few days ago). The VXLAN packet header includes a 24-bit segment ID, allowing you to create 16 million virtual segments. Using pseudo-random source UDP ports (probably hash-generated based on original MAC frame), you can get very good load balancing between the Nexus 1000V VEM and the physical switch using the 5-tuple-based load balancing while still preserving inter-VM packet order.</p>
<p>IP multicast is used to handle layer-2 flooding (broadcasts, multicasts and unknown unicasts). Support for layer-2 flooding allows everyone involved to pretend they’re still dealing with a traditional L2 broadcast domain (and use dynamic MAC learning); not an ideal solution (I would like to see <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/05/scaling-iaas-network-infrastructure.html">Amazon-like prohibition of flooding with ARP caching</a>) but still much better than what vCDNI offers today. If a VM running in a MAC-over-IP virtual segment goes bonkers, the damage will be limited to the ESX servers hosting VMs in the same virtual segment and the multicast path between them; with MAC-in-MAC encapsulation, the whole data center is affected.</p>
<p>As one would expect from a Nexus-based product, the new Nexus 1000V has a decent range of QoS features, allowing you to define per-tenant SLA. With full support for 802.1p and DSCP markings, you can extend the per-tenant QoS into the physical network, giving the cloud providers the ability to offer differentiated IaaS services.</p>
<p>More good news: the new encapsulation is fully integrated with vCloud Director. Finally we’ll be able to roll out scalable vCloud Director-based networks.</p>
<p>Even more good news: <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/08/imagine-ruckus-when-hypervisor-vendors.html">good bye, large-scale bridging and EVB</a>, we don’t need you for VM mobility anymore; we can go back to time-tested large-scale IP+multicast designs that kept the Internet running for the last few decades.</p>
<p>However, all is not rosy in the vCloud land. Cisco has implemented scalable virtual layer 2 segments, but the communication between segments still requires multi-NIC VMs (like vShield Edge) and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/04/virtual-network-appliances-benefits-and.html">traverses the userland</a>, the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/02/traffic-trombone-what-it-is-and-how-you.html">traffic trombones still wind their way around the data center</a>, and you cannot terminate the virtual segments on physical switches or tie them to physical VLANs. </p>
<p>Even with the remaining drawbacks, the MAC-in-IP encapsulation is way better than VLANs or MAC-in-MAC encapsulation we had so far, and I’m positive Cisco will eventually make the next logical steps.</p>
