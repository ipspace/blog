<p>Brandon Carroll has recently launched <a href="http://myipv6tutor.com/join?ap_id=ioshints">MyIPv6Tutor.com</a>, an e-learning program targeted at engineers that want to learn IPv6 basics at their own pace. I know Brandon is an excellent instructor, so there are at least four IPv6 training options I can wholeheartedly recommend.</p>
<p>If you need a <strong>high-level overview and an action plan</strong>, my Enterprise IPv6 – the first steps webinar is the right choice (<a href="http://entipv6.eventbrite.com/">register for an online session</a> or <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Recordings?code=IPv6E101">buy a recording</a>).<!--more--></p>
<p>If you’re interested in <strong>baseline technical details</strong> like IPv6 addressing, packet structure and basic router/host configuration, Brandon’s <a href="http://myipv6tutor.com/join?ap_id=ioshints">MyIPv6Tutor</a> is the best choice (<a href="http://myipv6tutor.com/join?ap_id=ioshints">register</a>).</p>
<p>Working for a Service Provider? You’ll find all the <strong>intricate details of deploying your IPv6 core</strong> and <strong>providing IPv6 to your enterprise and residential customers</strong> in my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Building_IPv6_Service_Provider_Core">Building Service Provider IPv6 Core</a> webinar (<a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Recordings?code=IPv6SPCore">buy a recording</a> or <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Subscription">yearly subscription</a>).</p>
<p>Last but definitely not least, if you need in-depth knowledge of major Cisco IOS IPv6 features, take the weeklong <a href="http://www.nil.com/ls/IP6FD30">IPv6 Fundamentals, Design, and Deployment v3.0</a> course.</p>
