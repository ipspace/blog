title: EVB (802.1Qbg) – the S component
url: /2011/05/evb-8021qbg-s-component/

<div class='update'>Update 2021-01-03: IBM implemented EVB in Linux bridge, and Juniper added EVB support to Junos, but I haven't seen (or heard of) a single EVB implementation since I wrote this blog post almost 9 years ago.</div>
<p>The Edge Virtual Bridging (EVB; 802.1Qbg) standard solves two important layer-2-based virtualization issues:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Automatic provisioning of access switches based on hypervisor-signaled information (discussed in the <a href="/2011/05/edge-virtual-bridging-evb-8021qbg-eases/">EVB eases VLAN configuration pains article</a>)</li>
<li>Multiplexing of multiple logical 802.1Q links over a single physical link.</li>
</ul>
<p>Logical link multiplexing might seem a solution in search of a problem until you discover that VMware-related design documents usually recommend <a href="http://www.kendrickcoleman.com/index.php?/Tech-Blog/vsphere-host-nic-design-6-nics.html">using 6 to 10 NICs per server</a> – an approach that either wastes switch ports or is hard to implement with blade servers’ mezzanine cards (due to limited number of backplane connections).<!--more--></p>
<p>Cisco was the first vendor that decided to use NIC virtualization to keep VMware happy – the Palo adapter can create up to 128 virtual NICs on the same physical silicon (and 2 10GE uplinks give you plenty of bandwidth and uplink redundancy). The Palo adapter uses proprietary VN-tag encapsulation, which Cisco promises will be replaced by 802.1Qbh.</p>
<p>The S component of the EVB standard tries to solve the same problem using 802.1ad (Q-in-Q) encapsulation to allow EVB to run on existing hardware. The outer 802.1ad VLAN tag is used to indicate the logical link; the edge relay (virtual switch) can use the inner VLAN tag to provider 802.1Q-capable bridging functionality to the virtual machines. You can also connect a virtual machine’s NIC (Virtual Station Interface – VSI) directly to the S-component, for example in a hypervisor bypass (VMdirect) scenario.</p>

<p>EVB (802.1Qbg) standard also specifies S-Channel Discovery and Configuration Protocol (CDCP) that allows the hypervisor host (EVB station) to create on-demand S-channels with the access switch (EVB bridge).</p>

<h4>Does S-component of EVB make sense today?</h4><p>As I explained in the <a href="/2011/05/edge-virtual-bridging-evb-8021qbg-eases/">EVB eases VLAN configuration pains article</a>, it’s very hard to implement Virtual Ethernet Bridge (VEB) and VSI Discovery Protocol (VDP) without the hypervisor support. You can, however, implement the S-component and CDCP within BIOS/NIC firmware without the hypervisor support. EVB-compliant switches and NICs could thus provide an alternative to Cisco’s Palo/VN-Tag.</p>
<h4>EVB (802.1Qbg) or VN-Tag/802.1Qbh?</h4><p>EVB’s S-component’s only advantage is its reliance on 802.1ad, making it implementable with existing 802.1ad-compliant hardware. Disregarding the legacy perspective, VN-Tag/802.1Qbh has two clear advantages:</p>
<p><strong>802.1Qbh uses its own encapsulation scheme</strong> and thus provides totally transparent point-to-point Ethernet channel; you can run 802.1Q, 802.1ad or 802.1ah on top of 802.1Qbh. 802.1Qbg provides 802.1Q-compliant logical channels.</p>
<p><strong>802.1Qbh supports multicast replication</strong> between logical links. 802.1Qbg supports multicast replication only within the hypervisor switch; when the access switch has to send the same multicast/broadcast packet across more than one logical link, it has to send multiple copies of the same packet.</p>
<p>A full-blown EVB with VEB/VEPA/VDP hypervisor support would be a clear winner despite the S-component limitations due to tight hypervisor/access switch integration it provides. </p>
<p class="info">Quick reality check: apart from vague “we will provide EVB support once the standard is ratified” statements, I haven’t heard anything about EVB-compliant hypervisors yet.</p>
