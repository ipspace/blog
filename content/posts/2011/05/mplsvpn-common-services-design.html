<p>The <em>Common Services </em>MPLS/VPN topology is the topology in which multiple customers access the same common servers without being able to access each other’s networks. You can implement this requirement with <a href="http://learning.nil.com/assets/Tips-/Flexible-Extranet-Implementation.pdf">judicious use of inter-VRF NAT</a> or with controlled route leaking between customers’ and common services VRFs (assuming the customers don’t use overlapping address space).<!--more--></p>
<p>A simple implementation of <em>Common Services </em>topology adds customer route targets to the common services VRF (Jeremy Stretch from Packetlife.net wrote an <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2011/may/19/mpls-vpn-common-services/">excellent in-depth description of this setup</a>). Modifying common services VRF whenever a new customer is added obviously does not scale; a truly scalable solution uses asymmetrical import/export route targets as explained in the following video:</p>
