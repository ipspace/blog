<p>... as some of its supporters seem to believe every now and then (I do get severe allergic reaction when someone claims it will <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/03/open-networking-foundation-fabric.html">change the laws of physics</a> or when I’m faced with <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/052511-openflow-expert.html">technical inaccuracies</a> not to mention <a href="http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2011/05/25/juniper-auriga-cuts-to-hold-watch-out-for-openflow/">knee-jerking financial experts</a>). Even more, assuming it can <a href="http://etherealmind.com/openflow-why-it-can-cross-the-adoption-gap/">cross the adoption gap</a>, it could fundamentally change the business models of networking vendors (maybe not in the way you’d like them to be changed). You can read more about my OpenFlow views in the <a href="http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/news/2240036095/Is-OpenFlow-networking-bunk-What-vendors-dont-want-to-discuss">article I wrote for SearchNetworking</a>.</p>
<p>On the more technological front, I still don’t expect to see miracles. Most OpenFlow-related ideas I’ve heard about have been tried (and failed) before. I fail to see why things would be different just because we use a different protocol to program the forwarding tables.</p>
