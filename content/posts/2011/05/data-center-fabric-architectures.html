title: Data Center Fabric Architectures update#1

<p>Two months ago I wrote the <a href="/2011/03/data-center-fabric-architectures/">Data Center Fabric Architectures</a> post jokingly defining <em>Borg </em>and <em>Big Brother </em>architectures. In the meantime, a number of vendors have launched (or announced) their fabric products and the post badly needed an update.</p>
<p>I decided to <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabric_Architectures_(Descriptions)">move the updated text to my main web site</a> (where it will be easier to edit), wrote an introductory section, removed a few tongue-in-cheek comments (after all, it’s time to get serious if Cisco’s Data Center blog <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/is-the-new-data-center-fabric-really-a-combination-of-borg-and-big-brother-answer-on-march-30th/">links to your article</a>) and added numerous links to in-depth articles and examples of individual architectures.<!--more--></p>
<p>So, without further ado, here’s the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabric_Architectures_(Descriptions)">Revision 2 of the Data Center Fabric Architectures</a>.</p>
<p>I plan to add two more architectures, reword the <em>Big Brother </em>one and add more in-depth OpenFlow-related information during the next few weeks.</p>
<p>As always, please leave a comment if I made a mistake or missed a product (try to limit yourself to things that are reasonably close to general availability).</p>
