<p>Occasionally I get e-mails from readers that can’t believe my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription">description of yearly webinar subscription</a> is correct. A few days ago I got this set of questions:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">If I pay the $199.00 does that mean I have access to ALL of your webinars?  </blockquote>
<p>Absolutely, <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Recordings">all sixteen of them</a> (with new ones being added every two or three months). And don’t forget you also get unlimited access to all live webinars.<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite">Do I have to watch them within a fixed time?  Do they expire?</blockquote>
<p>They don’t expire, but you can only watch them as long as your subscription is valid (a year after you purchase it). However, you can watch the recordings of live webinars you’ve attended indefinitely (regardless of the subscription expiry date).</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Do you provide additional references and material for further investigation after your webinars?</blockquote>
<p>Numerous webinars have tons of related router configurations; the Data Center one has a long recommended reading list. You can <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Materials">check the detailed contents of all webinars</a>. </p>
<p>Last but definitely not least, if you’re regretting you haven’t followed the “it’s better to buy the subscription” recommendations like <a href="http://twitter.com/balbler/statuses/61404913502126080">this one</a>, there’s always the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Upgrade">upgrade path</a>.</p>
