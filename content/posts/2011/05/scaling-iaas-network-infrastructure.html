title: Scaling IaaS network infrastructure

<p>I got totally fed up with the currently popular “flat-earth with long-distance bridging” architecture paradigm while developing the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/DCI">Data Center Interconnects</a> webinar. It all started with the <a href="/2011/02/layer-3-gurus-asleep-at-wheel/">layer-2 hypervisor switches and lack of decent L3 network-side solutions</a>; promoting <a href="/2011/04/vcloud-director-networking/">non-scalable cloudy solutions</a> doesn’t help either. </p>
<p>The network infrastructure would scale better if the <a href="/2011/04/vcloud-architects-ever-heard-of-mpls/">hypervisors would work as MPLS/VPN PE-routers</a>, but even MPLS would hit scalability limits when the number of servers grows into tens of thousands. The only truly scalable solution is <a href="/2011/05/complexity-belongs-to-network-edge/">IP-over-IP or MAC-over-IP implemented in the hypervisor switches</a>.</p>
<p>I tried to organize all these thoughts in the “<a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/tip/How-to-build-a-scalable-IaaS-cloud-network-infrastructure"><em>How to build a scalable IaaS cloud network infrastructure</em></a>” article that was recently published by SearchTelecom ... and just a few days after the article was published, Brad Hedlund pointed me to <a href="http://cloudscaling.com/pdf/IaaS_Building_Guide_v1.pdf">Infrastructure as a Service Builder’s Guide</a> document, which is saying almost the same thing (and coming to flawed conclusions because they had to promote OpenFlow and NEC).</p>
