<p>Working on the May Day feels like an oxymoron, but Sundays are about the only time I can clean up my overflowing Inbox.</p>
<p>The best post I’ve stumbled across recently is undoubtedly <a href="http://zenhabits.net/38/"><em>38 life lessons I’ve learned in 38 years</em></a><em> </em>(thank you, <a href="http://about.me/greg.meehan">@greg_meehan</a>). I will try to remember the <em>slow down </em>one. Another great one: <a href="http://www.storagebod.com/wordpress/?p=575"><em>Managing IT people</em></a> from Storagebod. Been there, seen that (and failed a few times).</p>
<p>And here’s the usual long list of links:<!--more--></p>
<h4>IPv6</h4><p>The NAT64 drafts finally got their RFC numbers: <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6144">RFC 6144 describes the framework</a>, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6145">RFC 6145 the stateless IP/ICMP translation</a>, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6146">RFC 6146 stateful NAT64</a> and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6147">RFC 6147 DNS64</a>. There’s also <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6156">RFC 6156 describing the TURN (NAT traversal) extensions for IPv6</a>.</p>
<p>The IPv6 CPE requirements draft became <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6204">RFC 6204</a>. Next step: hopefully the CPE vendors (I’m looking at you, Cisco/Linksys) will wake up and realize the IPv4 address exhaustion has already <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/723.html">whooshed by</a>.</p>
<p>Stretch continues his IPv6 education efforts, this week with the <a href="http://packetlife.net/blog/2011/apr/28/ipv6-link-local-addresses/">description of IPv6 link-local addresses</a>.</p>
<h4>Data Centers </h4><p>Mike Courtney is building L2 DCI (not a good idea) with Brocade gear and <a href="http://networkarch.blogspot.com/2011_04_01_archive.html">decided to document the configuration process</a> (excellent idea).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thestoragearchitect.com/2011/04/28/rise-of-the-it-generalist-a-bad-idea/">Rise of IT Generalist – a bad idea?</a> explains why the know-it-all engineers might be good enough for SMB environments (where you can’t afford to have more than one IT engineer anyway) but not for reasonably-sized data centers.</p>
<p><a href="http://lonesysadmin.net/2011/04/19/vmware-fault-tolerance-determinism-and-smp/">VMware Fault Tolerance, Determinism, and SMP</a> by the Lone Sysadmin is an excellent description of how VMware FT works and why it’s limited to VMs with a single vCPU.</p>
<p>Brad Hedlund’s <a href="http://bradhedlund.com/2011/04/21/data-center-scale-openflow-sdn/">view of OpenFlow is way more optimistic than mine</a>. Reminds me of all the enthusiasm I had a decade or two ago.</p>
<h4>Cloudy Failures</h4><p>Just in case you’ve just arrived from Mars: Amazon had a large-scale failure a few days ago, giving everyone loads of reasons to write why they love/hate/embrace/bash clouds.</p>
<p>Greg Ferro made a very valid observation: <a href="http://etherealmind.com/complex-systems-complex-failures-cloud-computing">complex systems have complex failures</a> that are hard to troubleshoot and recover from.</p>
<p>Massimo ReFerre got philosophical and <a href="http://it20.info/2011/04/tcp-clouds-udp-clouds-design-for-fail-and-aws/">wrote about UDP and TCP clouds</a>. While I agree that the cloudy services should provide reliable infrastructure, IaaS is definitely the wrong model to do it. Reliable PaaS/DBaaS would make way more sense.</p>
<p>Last but definitely not least, companies offering cloud-related products simply had to tell how everyone would be better off using their software. If you skip the self-promoting part, <a href="http://www.cloudswitch.com/page/amazon-outage-winners-and-losers">this article</a> is not bad.</p>
<p><strong>Large-scale networks</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.employees.org/~jevans/johnevans-plnog_sep09_x.pdf">Best practices in Network Planning</a> is an excellent in-depth tutorial. And now imagine some people claiming they’ll do something similar with OpenFlow.</p>
