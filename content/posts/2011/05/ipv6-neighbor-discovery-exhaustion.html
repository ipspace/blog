title: IPv6 Neighbor Discovery exhaustion attack and IPv6 subnet sizes

<p>A few days ago I got an <a href="http://twitter.com/frank_be/status/70031914781782016">interesting question</a>: “What’s your opinion on the <a href="http://inconcepts.biz/~jsw/IPv6_NDP_Exhaustion.pdf">IPv6 NDP exhaustion attack</a> and the recommendation to use /120 instead of /64?”</p>
<p>I guess we all heard the fundamentalist IPv6 mantra by now: “Every subnet gets a /64.” Being a good foot soldier, I included it in my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/IPv6E101">Enterprise IPv6 webinar</a>. Time to fix that slide and admit what we also knew for a long time: IPv6 is classless and we have yet to see the mysterious device that dies in flames when sniffing a prefix longer than a /64.<!--more--></p>
<p>Before you rush out and change all your 64s prefixes to 120s, a few words of caution:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>You have to use /64 prefixes on subnets running SLAAC.</li>
<li>I wouldn’t be surprised if some host stacks would be broken enough to die when faced with a local prefix not equal to /64. Conclusion: use /64 on all subnets to which workstations are attached.</li>
<li>Likewise, I wouldn’t expect consumer CPE vendors to understand IPv6 can be classless. As above, use /64s in consumer environment.</li>
<li>If a layer-3 forwarding device breaks down when having a prefix longer than /64 in its IPv6 routing table, throw it away.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jeff Wheeler <a href="http://inconcepts.biz/~jsw/IPv6_NDP_Exhaustion.pdf">proposes to use /120 on all (data center?) subnets</a>. I never tested this idea in practice and have no clue whether common server operating systems (Linux, Windows) would work with static IPv6 addresses out of a /120 prefix. Real-life experience? Please write a comment!</p>
<p>As a precaution against yet-to-be-discovered bugs, you could decide to use a single /120 prefix out of a /64 prefix on server-facing subnets (if the /120 prefix fails, you can easily go back to a /64 prefix without renumbering anything else but the affected subnet).</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could decide to be on the safe side, use the /64 prefixes on server subnets, assign static IPv6 addresses with high bits set to zero to servers (for example, use only 2001:DB8:C001:BABE::2/64 through 2001:DB8:C001:BABE::FE/64) and deploy inbound access lists on the L3 switches dropping packets sent to IPv6 addresses outside of that range.</p>
<p>Last but definitely not least, using /64 prefixes on point-to-point core links (and being exposed to script kiddies) is ridiculous. Juniper formalized this line of thinking with a <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6164">standard-track RFC</a>, recommending /127 prefixes on point-to-point links. And once you leave the 64-everywhere dogma behind, you can make the final step and allocate /128s to loopback addresses (I’ve tested this in Cisco IOS – works like a charm). Welcome back to the VLSM world.</p>
