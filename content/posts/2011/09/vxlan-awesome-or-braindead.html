<p>Just a few hours after <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/08/finally-mac-over-ip-based-vcloud.html">VXLAN was launched</a>, I received an e-mail from one of my readers asking (literally) if VXLAN was awesome or braindead. I decided to answer this question (you know the right answer is <em>it depends</em>) and a few others in a <a href="http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/news/1280091200/Virtual-Extensible-LAN-Awesome-or-braindead">FastPacket blog post published by SearchNetworking</a>.</p>
<p class="note">I wrote the post before <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/09/nvgre-because-one-standard-just-wouldnt.html">NVGRE</a> was published and missed the “brilliant” idea of using GRE key as virtual segment ID.</p>
