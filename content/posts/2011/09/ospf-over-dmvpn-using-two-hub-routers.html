<p>One of my readers sent me the following question a few days ago:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Do you have a webinar that covers Dual DMVPN HUB deployment using OSPF? If so which webinar covers it?</blockquote>
<p>I told him that the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/DMVPN"><em>DMVPN: From Basics to Scalable Networks</em></a> webinar covers exactly that scenario (and numerous others), describing both Phase 1 DMVPN and Phase 2 DMVPN design and implementation guidelines. Interestingly, he replied that the information on this topic seems to be very scant:<!--more--></p>
<blockquote class="cite">There is very little information about how to accomplish a dual hub, dual cloud DMVPN using OSPF. ("Maybe for good reasons?")</blockquote>
<p>I can’t see a good reason why you wouldn’t do that (assuming you keep the <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2010/10/dmvpn-scalability.html">number of remote sites reasonably low</a> and use a stub/NSSA area over DMVPN) and the “little information” part is definitely fixed in my DMVPN webinar. Even more, you get <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/DMVPN#Router_configurations">twenty sets of tested router configurations</a>, covering everything from simple OSPF/BGP/EIGRP/RIP/ODR designs to IPsec offload and Inter-AS MPLS/VPN over Phase 2 DMVPN.</p>
<p>Speaking of dual-hub designs, there is a slight gotcha: if you’re running <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/01/ospf-configuration-in-phase-1-dmvpn.html">Phase 1 DMVPN and using P2MP OSPF</a>, it doesn’t matter if you place both hub routers in the same DMVPN cloud. You’re way better off putting each hub in its separate DMVPN cloud (and IP subnet) in <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/01/configuring-ospf-in-phase-2-dmvpn.html">Phase 2 DMVPN</a> or you’ll eventually get hit by the <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/05/nhrp-convergence-issues-in-multi-hub.html">NHRP convergence issues</a> which can disrupt the DMVPN traffic for up to three minutes.</p>
