<p>Imagine you’d actually want to run VXLAN between two data centers (I wouldn’t but that’s beyond the point at this moment) and the only connectivity between the two is IP, no multicast. How would you implement IP multicast across a generic IP backbone? Anything goes, from duct tape (GRE) to creative solutions ... and don’t forget those pesky RPF checks. </p>
