<p>The <em>Mixed Feelings</em> award of the week goes to Doug Gourlay and his <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/why-fcoe-dead-its-not-buried-yet"><em>Why FCoE is Dead, But Not Buried Yet</em></a> article. While I agree with everything he’s saying about L2 and L3, the FCoE part of the post is shaky enough to generate tons of comments (or maybe that was the goal). For a hilarious perspective on the same topic, read <a href="http://datacenteroverlords.com/2011/09/14/fibre-channel-and-ethernet-the-odd-couple/"><em>Fiber Channel and Ethernet – the odd couple</em></a>.</p>
<p>And here are the other great articles I stumbled upon during the last few days:<!--more--></p>
<h4>Data Center and Virtualization</h4><p><a href="http://packetpushers.net/internet-as-a-service-in-an-mpls-cloud/">Internet-as-a-Service in a shared MPLS cloud</a>. Derick definitely knows what MPLS is and how it can be used in enterprise environments.</p>
<p>Fantastic <a href="http://pktmaniac.info/2011/08/nexus-1000v-features-mindmap/">Nexus 1000V Features Mindmap</a> from Yandy the Packet Maniac.</p>
<p><a href="http://packetpushers.net/cisco-catalyst-6500-supervisor-2t-technical-highlights-will-sup2t-stop-you-from-buying-nexus/">Cisco Catalyst 6500 Supervisor 2T Technical Highlights</a> from Ethan Banks. Must-read if you’re sitting anywhere close to a Cat6500.</p>
<p><a href="http://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/cto/security-and-networking/blog/2011/09/06/vxlans-and-the-cloud-infrastructure-suite">VXLANs and the Cloud Infrastructure Suite</a> – the “official” VMware’s view of VXLAN.</p>
<p><a href="http://lippisreport.com/2011/09/lippis-report-178-nearly-2-years-after-hp-buys-3com-for-2-7b-it-has-very-little-to-show-for-it-can-hp-make-it-in-networking/">Can HP Make It in Networking?</a> You know how much I love Gartner&amp;co, but once in a blue moon, there’s an analyst article worth linking to.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org/2011/09/14/the-end-of-the-infrastructure-engineer/">The End of the Infrastructure Engineer?</a> by Scott Lowe – excellent article &amp; great comments. We’re definitely not going away, but it doesn’t hurt if you understand more about how other Data Center technologies (servers, storage and virtualization) work and know a little bit about applications ... which brings me to the next category of links:</p>
<h4>Web apps and Scalability</h4><p><a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/9/13/must-see-5-steps-to-scaling-mongodb-or-any-db-in-8-minutes.html">Five steps to scaling any database</a>. Making sure your applications don’t overload the database is the first step, but there are a few others worth considering (note: sharding is the last one on the list).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thespanner.co.uk/2011/09/12/protecting-against-xss/">Protecting against XSS attacks</a> – most of the books and code samples programmers happily cut-and-paste into their applications are vulnerable to XSS attacks. No wonder nobody bothers attacking TCP stacks anymore; there are so many easier targets out there.</p>
