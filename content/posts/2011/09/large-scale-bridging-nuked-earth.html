<p>If you’re not working for a data center fabric vendor (in which case please read <a href="/2011/09/data-center-fabrics-did-i-miss-anything/">the other today’s post</a>), you’ll probably enjoy the excellent analogy <a href="http://packetattack.org/">Ethan Banks</a> made after reading my <a href="/2011/09/trill-goes-to-wan-bridging-craze/">TRILL-over-WAN post</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Think of a network topology like a road map. There's boulevards, major junction points, highways, dead ends, etc. Now imagine what that map looks like after it's been nuked from orbit: flat. Sure, we blew up the world, but you can go in a straight line anywhere you want.</blockquote>
<p>... and don’t forget to be nice to the <a href="/2010/10/coping-with-long-distance-vmotion/">people asking for inter-DC VM mobility</a> ;)</p>
