<p>If you’re not working for a data center fabric vendor (in which case please read <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/09/data-center-fabrics-did-i-miss-anything.html">the other today’s post</a>), you’ll probably enjoy the excellent analogy <a href="http://packetattack.org/">Ethan Banks</a> made after reading my <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/09/trill-goes-to-wan-bridging-craze.html">TRILL-over-WAN post</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">Think of a network topology like a road map. There's boulevards, major junction points, highways, dead ends, etc. Now imagine what that map looks like after it's been nuked from orbit: flat. Sure, we blew up the world, but you can go in a straight line anywhere you want.</blockquote>
