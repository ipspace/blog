<p>I’ll be in Krakow for the <a href="http://plnog.pl/spotkanie-7-wrzesien/agenda">PLNOG</a>/<a href="http://euronog.eu/meeting2011/schedule">EuroNOG</a> conferences Wednesday through Friday. <a href="http://plnog.pl/spotkanie-7-wrzesien/impreza">This</a> is not the primary reason I’m arriving on Wednesday (although it does look tempting) – I wanted to have enough time for discussions with fellow networking engineers and Thursday afternoon/Friday will probably be pretty busy. So, if you’d like to chat with me about exciting networking technologies, just find me in the crowd (unfortunately I won’t be wearing <a href="http://packetpushers.spreadshirt.co.uk/ivan-pepelnjak-thinks-your-network-stack-sucks-A15652319/customize/color/1">this T-shirt</a>) ... and if you’d like to have a more serious (and longer) discussion, <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Contact">get in touch with me</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/ioshints">send me a tweet</a>.</p>
