<p>When I <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/08/finally-mac-over-ip-based-vcloud.html">started writing about VXLAN</a>, I received a few tweets along the lines of “<em>I have no clue what you’re writing about</em><em>.</em>” Here’s a chance to fix that: I’ll run an <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/VMintro">Introduction to Virtualized Networking</a> webinar in early October (<a href="http://vnetintro.eventbrite.com/">register</a>), trying to demystify the acronyms and marketectures. It doesn’t assume you know anything about server virtualization or IaaS; we’ll start from scratch and cover as much ground as possible.</p>
<p class="warn">If you’ve attended the <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/DC30">Data Center 3.0</a> or <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/VMnet">VMware Networking Deep Dive</a> webinars, you won’t learn anything new from this one; it’s a prequel to the other two.</p>
