Occasionally my readers ask me if I would be available for a consulting/design project (or send me questions that are actually design review/second opinion challenges). 

**TL&DR**: No... but I created [ExpertExpress service](http://www.ipSpace.net/ExpertExpress) in 2011 to address those cases.

**How can you use it?** Anything goes. We've been doing technology briefings, design reviews, router configurations, troubleshooting... Just make sure your problem is well-defined so we won't spend time trying to figure out what the problem is.

**What do you need?** An interesting challenge and some spare budget. Network diagrams and documentation help. We'll use GoToWebinar or Zoom, so it makes sense to have a diagram that approximates your network topology to draw on.

**How does it work?** It's just a few simple steps:

-   You send us the description of the topic you'd like to cover. We might say no -- after all, although we have a team providing this service, we're not experts in everything network-related;
-   We send you a link to purchase the service, you swipe your credit card, we schedule the online whiteboarding call, and we try to solve your problem.

**No paperwork?** No paperwork. Not negotiable.

No NDA. If you're concerned about your confidential data, change the network diagrams/addressing/configurations, and contact us from your private e-mail address. Also, don't forget that we're in a reputation-based business; we can't afford to be a blabbermouth.

No SOW. The service definition is clear & simple -- we'll try to solve your problem in a live  conference call, we'll spend between one and one and a half hour, and we'll refund you (actually, cancel the credit card transaction) if you're not happy with the results.

**Exclusions?** Sure -- don't expect us to read book-size network designs or write extensive follow-up reports.

**Next steps?** Read the [service definition](http://www.ipSpace.net/ExpertExpress), find an interesting challenge, and [get in touch](https://www.ipspace.net/Contact#Consulting).
