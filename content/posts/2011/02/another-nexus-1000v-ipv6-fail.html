title: Another Nexus 1000V IPv6 FAIL
url: /2011/02/another-nexus-1000v-ipv6-fail.html
---

<p>The keynote speeches during this week’s Cisco Live Europe were full of data centers, virtualization and cloudy promises. Mysteriously absent was IPv6; looks like a 15 year old protocol is no longer sexy enough to be mentioned.</p>
<p>Cisco’s execution obviously follows its vision – <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus1000/sw/4_2_1_s_v_1_4/release/notes/n1000v_rn.html">new version of Nexus 1000V software</a> was released at the same time. Limitations and Restrictions section is very clear: <a href="#wp65087">IPv6 ACLs are still not supported</a>. Is this a sign of a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2010/11/ipv6-in-data-center-after-year-cisco-is.html">deliberate IPv6-less Data Center strategy</a> or is it something different? </p>
<p>In totally unrelated news, the last two blocks of IPv4 address space have been allocated to APNIC this week, triggering the allocation of the remaining five blocks to regional RIRs; the event <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=iPocalypse">lovingly known as IPocalypse</a>. So far, I haven’t seen a reasonable alternative to IPv6, so I guess we’re stuck with it for good.</p>
<!--more--><p>But maybe it’s all part of a grand vision: lack of IPv6 in data centers might trigger faster embracement of cloud services. Or maybe not ... in the next totally unrelated bit of (missing) news, Amazon EC2 still lacks native IPv6 connectivity.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the enterprise networking engineers, some companies did manage to combine two seemingly unrelated visions: if you need to offer your legacy IPv4 data center applications to the brave new world of IPv6 clients, F5 will be more than happy to sell you a few (field-tested) BIG IP boxes. After all, if they’re good enough for Facebook, they just might survive your traffic load as well.</p>
