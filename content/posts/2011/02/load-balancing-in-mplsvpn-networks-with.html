title: Load sharing in MPLS/VPN networks with route reflectors

<p>Some of the e-mails and comments I received after writing the “<a href="/2011/02/changing-vpnv4-route-attributes-within.html"><em>Changing VPNv4 route attributes</em></a><em>” </em>post illustrated common MPLS/VPN misconceptions, so it’s worth addressing them in a series of posts. Let’s start with the simplest scenario: load <del class="error">balancing</del><ins class="corr">sharing</ins> toward a multi-homed customer site. We’ll use a very simple MPLS/VPN network with three customer sites, four CE-routers, four PE-routers a route reflector:</p>

<!--more--><p>Let’s assume that we use the default MPLS/VPN RT/RD design rules: one RD and one import/export RT per simple VPN. The IPv6 (or IPv4) default routes received by PE-A and PE-B are transformed into VPNv6 (or VPNv4) routes (<tt>[RD]::/0</tt> or <tt>RD:0.0.0.0/0</tt>) and sent to RR. </p>
<p>RR receives two identical VPNv6 (or VPNv4) routes from two sources (PE-A and PE-B), installs both of them in its BGP table, <em>selects the best one </em>and <em>sends the best one to the other BGP neighbors</em>. PE-C and PE-D thus receive only <em>a single default route</em> and forward all traffic toward PE-A or PE-B (based on the decision BGP made on RR). There is <em>absolutely no way </em>to change the RR behavior – it’s one of those BGP rules that nobody wanted to touch (yet): only the best routes in the BGP table are propagated to BGP neighbors.</p>
<p class="note">The above statement is not entirely correct – the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/iproute_bgp/configuration/guide/irg_best_external.pdf">BGP Best External</a> feature is violating that rule and advertising <em>best external </em>route even when <em>better internal </em>route exists.</p>
<p>To enable PE-C and PE-D to forward traffic toward PE-A <em>and </em>PE-B, you have to make the two default routes somehow different. The <em>only </em>trick that works is changing the RD on one of them:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>PE-A advertises the default route received from CE-A as <tt>[RD1]::/0</tt> (or <tt>RD1:0.0.0.0/0</tt>)</li>
<li>PE-B advertises the default route received from CE-B as <tt>[RD2]::/0</tt> (or <tt>RD2:0.0.0.0/0</tt>)</li>
<li>RR receives <em>two different routes </em>(within the VPNv6 address family, <tt>[RD1]::/0</tt> and <tt>[RD2]::/0</tt> are different routes) and propagates <em>both of them </em>to PE-C and PE-D.</li>
<li>PE-C and PE-D receive <em>both routes</em> and import <em>both of them </em>into the same VRF (remember: imports are based on RT, not RD) , enabling true load sharing toward PE-A and PE-B.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">You have to configure BGP load sharing with the <strong>maximum-paths ibgp </strong><strong><em>number </em></strong>router configuration command within the IPv4 VRF address family on PE-C and PE-D, otherwise they will not insert more than one BGP route into the VRF IP routing table (even though two routes are present in the BGP table).</p>
