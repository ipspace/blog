<p>Numerous interesting technical articles I found during the last week:</p>
<p>The loopback interface is always reachable ... or <a href="http://evilrouters.net/2011/01/31/when-isnt-a-loopback-always-reachable/">maybe it’s not, depending on your software release</a>. In totally unrelated news, <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/012011-gartner-slams-cisco-single-vendor.html">Gartner is telling your CIO how a multi-vendor network reduces the overall costs</a>. Maybe it’s time to factor <em>all </em>the hidden costs in the calculation. BTW, while you’re reading Gartner reports and talking to your vendors, <a href="http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html">keep this list handy</a>.</p>
<p>Joe Onisick wrote a <a href="http://www.definethecloud.net/otv-and-vplex-plumbing-for-disaster-avoidance">fantastic Disaster Avoidance introductory article</a>. If you need the basics, this is the first thing you should read. If you need more Data Center Interconnect (DCI) details, <a href="http://dci.eventbrite.com/">register for</a> my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/DCI">DCI webinar</a>.</p>
<!--more--><p><a href="http://www.unifiedcomputingblog.com/?page_id=5">Dave Alexander</a> has <a href="http://www.unifiedcomputingblog.com/?p=234">updated his 8Gb FC versus 10Gb FCoE post</a>, making it another must-read item for anyone interested in FC/FCoE debate. The fact that <a href="#!/BRCDbreams">BRCDBreams</a> decided to write a comment including “<em>There is much dispute regarding the future market for FCoE vs. Fibre Channel</em>” makes it even more fun to read.</p>
<p>Marko continues his myth debunking crusade. This week’s target: <a href="http://blog.ipexpert.com/2011/01/19/old-ccie-myths-vlan-1/">VLAN 1</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/01/canada-gets-first-bitter-dose-of-metered-internet-billing.ars">Canadian ISP going crazy</a> – you probably know what my position on the Net Neutrality issue is, but this is plain stupid.</p>
<p>Yandy (the Packet Maniac) wrote a <a href="http://blog.bright-network.info/2011/01/31/vpc-and-vss-features-and-comparison/">nice comparison of vPC and VSS features</a>. You’ll find even <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/search/label/Link%20aggregation">more MLAG architectures in my blog</a> and in my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/DataCenterIntro">Data Center</a> webinar (<a href="http://datacenter20.eventbrite.com/">register</a> or <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/Recordings">buy a recording</a>).</p>
<p>I am positive Gartner told you a while ago that outsourcing will lower your overall costs. For whatever reason, <a href="http://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/news/2240031466/Texas-rebids-IBM-data-center-consolidation-project">some outsourcing projects</a> turn out the same way as some multi-vendor networks.</p>
