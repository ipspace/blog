title: How would you use VPLS transport in L2 DCI?

<p>One of the questions answered in my <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/DCI">Data Center Interconnect</a> webinar is: “what options do I have to build a layer-2 interconnect with transport technology X”, with X <span>∈</span> {dark-fiber, DWDM, SONET, pseudowire, VPLS, MPLS/VPN, IP}. VPLS is one of the tougher nuts to crack; it provides a switched LAN emulation, usually with no end-to-end spanning tree (which you wouldn’t want to have anyway).</p>
<p>Imagine the following simple scenario where we want to establish redundant connectivity between two data centers and the only transport technology we can get is VPLS (or some other Carrier Ethernet LAN service):</p>

<p>I could figure out two obvious ways of using VPLS:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Use it as an IP+MPLS subnet and run customer-side VPLS-over-MPLS, VPLS-over-MPLS-over-GRE (which makes no sense unless you need IPsec) or OTV over this subnet;</li>
<li>Run TRILL over VPLS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there any others? Please tell me in the comments!</p>
<p class="note">TRILL supports standard bridges and VLANs between RBridges and can thus work over VPLS service. FabricPath and Shortest Path Bridging (SPB; 802.1aq) require point-to-point links between FP/SPB-enabled switches and might work over EoMPLS/L2TPv3 pseudowires (depending on how transparent they are), but not over VPLS.</p>
