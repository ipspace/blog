<p>One of the questions answered in my <a href="http://www.ioshints.info/DCI">Data Center Interconnect</a> webinar (<a href="http://dci.eventbrite.com/">register here</a>) is: “what options do I have to build a layer-2 interconnect with transport technology X”, with X <span>∈</span> {dark-fiber, DWDM, SONET, pseudowire, VPLS, MPLS/VPN, IP}. VPLS is one of the tougher nuts to crack; it provides a switched LAN emulation, usually with no end-to-end spanning tree (which you wouldn’t want to have anyway). </p>
<p>Imagine the following simple scenario where we want to establish redundant connectivity between two data centers and the only transport technology we can get is VPLS:</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/2011/02/s1600-DCI_VPLS.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="95" src="/2011/02/s320-DCI_VPLS.png" width="320"/></a></div>
<!--more--><p>I could figure out two obvious ways of using VPLS:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>Use it as an IP+MPLS subnet and run customer-side VPLS-over-MPLS, VPLS-over-MPLS-over-GRE (which makes no sense unless you need IPsec) or OTV over this subnet;</li>
<li>Run TRILL over VPLS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there any others? Please tell me in the comments!</p>
<p class="note">TRILL supports standard bridges and VLANs between RBridges and can thus work over VPLS service. FabricPath and Shortest Path Bridging (SPB; 802.1aq) require point-to-point links between FP/SPB-enabled switches and might work over EoMPLS/L2TPv3 pseudowires (depending on how transparent they are), but not over VPLS.</p>
