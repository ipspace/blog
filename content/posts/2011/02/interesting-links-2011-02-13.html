<p>If there were a “blog post of the week” award, Brad Hedlund would definitely deserve it for his <a href="http://bradhedlund.com/2011/02/09/emergence-of-the-massively-scalable-data-center/">Emergence of the Massively Scalable Data Center</a> article ... but then I may be biased as he came to the same conclusions I did: we need VM agility, but bridging doesn’t scale and routing is too rigid (because we <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/02/layer-3-gurus-asleep-at-wheel.html">never tried to make it flexible</a>), so we need a fundamental change in network architecture.</p>
