<p>Some of my readers wanted to buy the <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription"><em>yearly subscription</em></a><em> </em>but couldn’t decide which webinar to register for first (the yearly subscription was sold as webinar tickets). Fortunately the database structure I used for <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Recordings">recordings</a> turned out to be easily extendable; you can now buy the yearly subscription directly from my website with Google Checkout.</p>
<p>The amount of the material you get with the yearly subscription is also growing: you get <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Recordings">access to recordings of sixteen webinars</a> (and growing), <a href="https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Materials">all corresponding PDFs</a> and well over 150 router configurations ... plus unlimited access to all live webinar sessions for the duration of your subscription.</p>
