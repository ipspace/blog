title: VEPA or vCloud Network Isolation?

<p>If I could design my dream data center with total disregard to today’s limitations (and technologies from an alternate universe), it would have optimal connectivity between any two endpoints (real or virtual), no limits on VM mobility and on-demand L4-7 services insertion (be it firewalling, load balancing or something else) ... all of that implemented on truly scalable trombone-free networking infrastructure (in a dream world I don’t care whether it’s called <em>routing </em>or <em>bridging</em>).</p>
<!--more--><p>Every single networking and virtualization vendor is claiming to have the keys to this nirvana ... if only we would buy their products. Most of the claims turn out to be pure marketing, aimed solely at getting as much of our budgets as possible. I already <a href="http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/vCloud-Director-Sure-hand-the-network-over-to-server-admins">wrote about vCloud Director Network Isolation</a>; it turns out Edge Virtual Bridging (EVB; 802.1Qbg) and VEPA are not much better (although HP <a href="http://h30499.www3.hp.com/hpeb/attachments/hpeb/bladesblog00/130/1/VEPA-EVB%20Industry%20Whitepaper.pdf">promises heavens-on-earth</a> once they get it implemented). Instead of focusing on what we really need to build scalable data centers, networking and virtualization vendors prefer to fight over distribution of our budgets.</p>
