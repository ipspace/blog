title: Why would FC/FCoE scale better than iSCSI?
url: /2011/02/why-would-fcfcoe-scale-better-than.html
---

<p>During one of the iSCSI/FC/FCoE tweetstorms @stu <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/stu/status/4272998110461952">made an interesting claim</a>: <em>FC scales to thousands of nodes; iSCSI can’t do that</em>. </p>
<p>You know I’m no storage expert, but I fail to see how FC would be inherently (architecturally) better than iSCSI. I would understand someone claiming that existing host or storage iSCSI adapters behave worse than FC/FCoE adapters, but I can’t grasp why properly implemented iSCSI network could not scale. </p>
<p>Am I missing something? Please help me figure this one out. Thank you!</p>
