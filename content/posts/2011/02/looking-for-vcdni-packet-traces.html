<p>One of the things I wanted to test in my <a href="/2011/01/vmware-cluster-up-and-running-in-three/">UCS lab</a> was the vCloud Director; I was interested in the details of the MAC-in-MAC implementation used by vCDNI. Unfortunately vCD requires an Oracle database and I simply didn’t have enough time to set that up. If you have vCD up and running and use vCDNI to create isolated networks, I would appreciate if you could take a few packet traces of traffic exchanged between VMs running on different ESX servers and send them to me. What I would need most are examples of:</p>
<ul class="ListParagraph"><li>ARP request between VMs. Clear the ARP cache on one VM and ping the other;</li>
<li>Regular traffic (a telnet session or HTTP request would be just fine);</li>
<li>IP broadcast, for example pinging 255.255.255.255 (works on Linux, but not on Windows);</li>
<li>IP multicast. Pinging 224.0.0.1 or 224.0.0.2 should do the trick.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you!</p>
