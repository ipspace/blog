Erik Auerswald sent me a pointer to a blog post by Dave Taht: [The state of fq_codel and sch_cake worldwide](https://blog.cerowrt.org/post/state_of_fq_codel/). It's so nice to see what a huge impact Dave made since he started the [Bufferbloat project](https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/).

**Hint**: if you have no idea what Bufferbloat or fq_codel are, you REALLY SHOULD explore Dave's web site.
