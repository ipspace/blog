I [migrated my blog to Hugo](/2020/03/ipspace-blog-runs-on-hugo/) two years ago, and never regretted the decision. At the same time I implemented version control with Git, and started using GitHub (and GitLab for a convoluted set of reasons) to host the blog repository.

After hesitating for way too long, I decided to go one step further and made the [blog repository](https://github.com/ipspace/blog) public. The next time a blatant error of mine annoys you fork it, fix my blunder(s), and submit a pull request (or write a comment and I'll fix stuff like I did in the past).
