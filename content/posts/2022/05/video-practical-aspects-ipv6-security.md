[Christopher Werny](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Christopher_Werny) has tons of hands-on experience with IPv6 security (or lack thereof), and described some of his findings in the [Practical Aspects of IPv6 Security](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/IPv6Sec/E3%20-%20Practical%20Aspects.mp4?doccode=IPv6Sec&start=89) part of [IPv6 security webinar](https://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_security), including:

* Impact of dual-stack networks
* Security implications of IPv6 address planning
* Isolation on routing layer and strict filtering
* IPv6-related requirements for Internet- or MPLS uplinks
