ipSpace.net subscribers are probably already familiar with the Design Clinic: a monthly Zoom call in which we discuss [real-life design- and technology challenges](https://designclinic.ipspace.net/pages/submit/). I started it in September 2021 and it quickly became reasonably successful; we covered [almost two dozen topics so far](https://designclinic.ipspace.net/).

Most of the challenges contributed for the [June 2022 session](https://designclinic.ipspace.net/posts/2022/06/) were focused on VXLAN use cases (quite fitting considering I just updated the [VXLAN Technical Deep Dive](https://www.ipspace.net/VXLAN_Technical_Deep_Dive) webinar), including:

* Can we implement Data Center Interconnect (DCI) with VXLAN? (Yes, but...)
* Can we run VXLAN over SD-WAN (and does it make sense)? (Yes/No)
* What happened to traditional MPLS/VPN Enterprise core and can we use VXLAN/EVPN instead? (Still there/Maybe)
* Should we use routers or switches as data center WAN edge devices, and how do we integrate them with VXLAN/EVPN data center fabric? (Yes ðŸ˜Š)

For more details, join us on June 6th. There's just a minor gotcha: you have to be an active [ipSpace.net subscriber](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/) to do it.
