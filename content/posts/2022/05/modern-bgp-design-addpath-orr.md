title: Modern IBGP Design with AddPath and ORR
---
Nicola Modena created an [interesting presentation](http://blog.modena.to/2022/04/modern-bgp-design.html) describing IBGP designs using BGP [Additional Paths](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/12/bgp-multipath-addpath.html) and [Optimal Route Reflection functionality](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/10/bgp-optimal-route-reflection.html)

Hope you'll enjoy the presentation as much as I did... and make sure you understand [potential circular dependencies](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/10/circular-dependencies-considered-harmful.html) you might be introducing when running a route reflector as a virtual machine.
