title: Modern IBGP Design with AddPath and ORR
---
Nicola Modena created an [interesting presentation](http://blog.modena.to/2022/04/modern-bgp-design.html) describing IBGP designs using BGP [Additional Paths](/2021/12/bgp-multipath-addpath/) and [Optimal Route Reflection functionality](/2021/10/bgp-optimal-route-reflection/)

Hope you'll enjoy the presentation as much as I did... and make sure you understand [potential circular dependencies](/2021/10/circular-dependencies-considered-harmful/) you might be introducing when running a route reflector as a virtual machine.
