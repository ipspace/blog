I stumbled upon an interesting article in one of my RSS feeds: should we build [smart highways or smart cars?](https://circleid.com/posts/20220614-smart-highways-or-smart-cars)

The article eloquently explains how ridiculous and expensive it would be to put the smarts in the infrastructure, and why most everyone is focused on building smart cars. The same concepts should be applied to networking, but of course the networking vendors furiously disagree -- the network should be as complex, irreplaceable, and expensive as possible. I collected [a few examples seven years ago](/2013/06/network-virtualization-and-spaghetti/), and nothing changed in the meantime.
