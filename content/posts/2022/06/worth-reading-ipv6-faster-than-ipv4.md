In a recent blog post, [Donal O Duibhir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/podomere/) claims 
[IPv6 is faster than IPv4](https://pansift.com/blog/is-ipv6-faster-than-ipv4/)... 39% of the time, which at a quick glance makes as much sense as "[60% of the time it works every time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjvQFtlNQ-M)". The real reason for his claim is that there was no difference between IPv4 and IPv6 in ~30% of the measurements.

Unfortunately he measured only the Wi-Fi part of the connection (until the first-hop gateway); I hope he'll keep going and measure response times from well-connected dual-stack sites like Google's public DNS servers.
