IPv6 security-focused presentations were usually an awesome opportunity to lean back and enjoy another round of whack-a-mole, often starting with an attacker using IPv6 Router Advertisements to divert traffic (see also: [getting bored at Brussels airport](/2011/11/ipv6-security-getting-bored-bru-airport.html)) .

Rogue IPv6 RA challenges and the corresponding countermeasures are thus a mandatory part of any IPv6 security training, and [Christopher Werny](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Christopher_Werny) did a great job [describing them](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/IPv6Sec/E5.2%20-%20Rogue%20RA%20Challenges.mp4?doccode=IPv6Sec) in [IPv6 security webinar](https://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_security).
