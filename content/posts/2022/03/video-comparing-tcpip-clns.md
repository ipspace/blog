If you were building networks in early 1990s you probably remember at least a half-dozen different network protocols. Only one of them survived (IPv6 came later), with another one (CLNP) providing an interesting view into a totally different parallel universe that evolved using a different set of fundamental principles.

After [introducing the network-layer addressing](/2022/02/video-network-layer-addressing.html), I [compared the two and pointed out where one or the other was clearly better](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/NA3.2%20-%20Comparing%20IP%20and%20CLNP%20Addressing.mp4?doccode=Net101). 

You might think that it makes no sense to talk about protocols that were rarely used in old days, and that are almost non-existent today, but as always _those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it_, this time reinventing CLNP principles in [IPv6-based](https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/09/coming-full-circle-on-ipv6-address.html) [layer-3-only data center fabrics](https://blog.ipspace.net/2015/05/reinventing-clns-with-l3-only-forwarding.html).
