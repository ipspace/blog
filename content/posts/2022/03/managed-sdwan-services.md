Should service providers offer managed SD-WAN services? According to _[Betteridge's law of headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines)_, the answer is **NO**, and that's exactly what I explained in a [short video with the same name](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/NetBiz/MS1%20-%20Should%20Service%20Providers%20Offer%20Managed%20SD-WAN%20Services.mp4?doccode=NetBiz).

Turns out there's not much to explain; even with my usual verbosity I was done in five minutes, so you might want to watch _[SD-WAN Technical Challenges](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/NetBiz/MS2%20-%20SD-WAN%20Technical%20Challenges.mp4?doccode=NetBiz)_ as well.
