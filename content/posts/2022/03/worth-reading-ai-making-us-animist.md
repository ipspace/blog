Erik Hoel published a [wonderful article](https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/ai-makes-animists-of-us-all) describing how he's fighting the algorithm that is deciding whether to approve a charge on his credit card.

> My credit card now has a kami. Such new technological kamis are, just like the ancient ones, fickle; sometimes blessing us, sometimes hindering us, and all we as unwilling animists can do is a modern ritual to the inarticulate fey creatures that control our inboxes and our mortgages and our insurance rates.

There are networking vendors unleashing similar "spirits" on our networks. Welcome to the brave new world ;)
