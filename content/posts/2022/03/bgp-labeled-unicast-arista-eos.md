A week ago I described how [Cisco IOS implemented BGP Labeled Unicast](bgp-labeled-unicast-cisco-ios.html). In this blog post we'll focus on Arista EOS using [the same lab as before](https://github.com/ipspace/netsim-examples/tree/master/MPLS/ldp-bgp-lu):

{{<note info>}}Arista EOS has two sets of routing daemons configured as *ribd* or *multi-agent* model. This blog post is describing the behavior of *multi-agent* model.{{</note>}}

Arista EOS treats Labeled Unicast as a completely separate address family:

An IP prefix can be advertised with or without a label, but it has to be listed in a **network** statement in the corresponding address family (or redistributed into it).

While it looks like BGP routing processes on Arista EOS store labeled and unlabeled prefixes in the same BGP RIB (at least according to the **show ip bgp** printouts), the RIB contains two copies of the same prefix if they were advertised over the two address families. 

For example, the RIB table on PE1 contains two copies of all IPv4 prefixes advertised in our lab apart from the prefix advertised by CE1 which does not use IPv4 Labeled Unicast.

Looking at an individual prefix, you'll notice that both copies are the **best** routes (in their corresponding address families):

```

Even more interesting, Arista EOS does not enter the labeled unicast prefixes into the IP routing table by default. After deactivating the neighbors in the IPv4 address family on the route reflector (turning the central AS into BGP-LU-only AS), the routing table on PE2 no longer contains the BGP route for CE1.

You have to configure **bgp labeled-unicast rib ip** within the BGP routing process to use labeled unicast prefixes for IP forwarding. Doing that on PE1 brings the BGP prefix for CE2 into the routing table, including the label stack built from BGP-LU and LDP labels:

The **bgp labeled-unicast rib ip** nerd knob solves the IP forwarding challenges on PE1, but we're still missing the BGP prefix for CE1 on PE2 -- CE1 advertises its prefix only over IPv4 AF and that advertisement never gets across IPv4-LU-only route reflector.

I couldn't find a way to import routes from IPv4 address family into IPv4 Labeled Unicast address family, so it looks like we have these design options:

* Use BGP-LU to distribute next hop labels for other services (Inter-AS MPLS/VPN Option C typically uses this approach as does SR-MPLS-over-BGP). IPv4-LU/IPv6-LU address families are totally independent from the IPv4/IPv6 address families and are not used for IP forwarding.
* Use BGP-LU to distribute BGP prefixes that can be used for IP forwarding. Labeled prefixes are preferred over unlabeled ones, but you SHOULD run labeled- and unlabeled address families in parallel in a non-homogeneous environment to ensure at least one of them has a usable prefix.

Have I missed something? Please write a comment!

### Summary: Arista EOS

* Labeled unicast is configured as an independent address family. BGP neighbors have to be activated within the **ipv4 labeled-unicast** or **ipv6 labeled-unicast** address family.
* BGP prefixes must be originated within **ipv4/ipv6** and/or **ipv4 labeled-unicast/ipv6 labeled-unicast** address families. Unlabeled BGP prefixes cannot be imported into labeled address family or vice versa. Routes redistributed into BGP are not redistributed into **labeled-unicast** address families[^NN].
* Separate updates are sent for labeled and unlabeled prefixes.
* Labeled prefixes are not inserted into the IP routing- and forwarding tables unless you configure **bgp labeled-unicast rib ip** within the BGP routing process.

[^NN]: Or I missed another nerd knob, in which case please write  a comment and I'll fix the blog post.
