One of ipSpace.net subscribers sent me the following feedback on _[Ansible for Networking Engineers](https://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers)_ webinar:

>  The "Ansible for Network Engineers" webinar is of the highest caliber. I've taken Ansible courses with your CCIE peers, and though they are good, I objectively feel, that I get more of a total comprehensive understanding with network automation here at ipSpace. Also, I enjoy your professional care-free tone, and how you pepper humor into the subject matter.
>
> I've setup a virtual lab with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS server, and am using both Aruba and Cisco switches/routers. Ansible has lots of nuances that will take me time to fully get a grip-on-- but, that's why I subscribe with the network pros like ipSpace.
