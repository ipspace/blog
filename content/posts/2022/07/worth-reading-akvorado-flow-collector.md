The results you can get when you know how to apply proper glue to a bunch of open-source tools never cease to amaze me. The latest entrant in that category: [Akvorado](https://github.com/vincentbernat/akvorado), a Netflow/IPFIX collector and analyzer by [Vincent Bernat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentbernat/).

Some of the sample graphs (shown in the GitHub repo) are not far off from those that knocked our socks off during the first [Kentik Networking Field Day presentation](/2017/09/nfd16-first-impressions.html). Definitely a tool worth exploring ;)
