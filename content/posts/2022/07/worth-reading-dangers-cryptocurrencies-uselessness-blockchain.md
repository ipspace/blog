[Bruce Schneier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Schneier) wrote an article on [the dangers of cryptocurrencies and the uselessness of blockchain](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2022/06/on-the-dangers-of-cryptocurrencies-and-the-uselessness-of-blockchain.html), including this gem:

> From its inception, this technology has been a solution in search of a problem and has now latched onto concepts such as financial inclusion and data transparency to justify its existence, despite far better solutions to these issues already in use.
