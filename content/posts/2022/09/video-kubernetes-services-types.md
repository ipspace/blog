Kubernetes services are like networking standards: there are so many to choose from. In his brief [introduction to Kubernetes service types](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Kubernetes/1.8%20-%20Kubernetes%20Service%20Types.mp4?doccode=Kubernetes), [Stuart Charlton](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Stuart_Charlton) listed six of them, and I'm positive there are more. That's what you get when you're trying to reinvent every network load balancing method known to mankind ;)
