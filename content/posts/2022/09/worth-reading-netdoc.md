Andrea Dainese released an interesting tool that [performs automated network discovery](https://www.adainese.it/blog/2022/08/28/netdoc-automated-network-discovery-and-documentation/), pushes the discovered data into NetBox, and then uses *netbox-topology-views* plugin to create network topology diagrams.

Definitely worth exploring!
