In the previous MLAG Deep Dive blog posts we discussed the innards of a standalone MLAG cluster. Now let's see what happens when we connect such a cluster to a VXLAN fabric -- we'll use our standard MLAG topology and add a VXLAN transport underlay to it with another switch connected to the other end of the underlay network.

A few notes before we get to the cumbersome details:

* We still need the peer link between the MLAG cluster members. Replacing the peer link with a virtual link over the VXLAN fabric is another interesting topic that we'll deal with some other time.
* Connecting MLAG clusters in a [traditional bridging fabric](https://blog.ipspace.net/2022/09/mlag-bridging-evpn.html) is boring. Every MLAG cluster looks like a dual-homed host to adjacent clusters.
* Considerations similar to the ones described in this blog post apply to other transport technologies (TRILL, SPBM) or [proprietary fabric solutions](https://blog.ipspace.net/2022/05/cisco-fabric-path-and-friends.html), but we won't discuss them because those technologies aren't exactly mainstream anymore.

### Dynamic MAC Learning Ruins the Day

In a typical VXLAN-based fabric, we'd assign a unique VXLAN tunnel endpoint (VTEP) IP address to every leaf switch. That approach does not work for MLAG clusters *if we want to rely on dynamic MAC learning instead of using EVPN control plane*.

Imagine host A having a lot of TCP or UDP sessions with host Z:

* If the host A uses the typical 5-tuple hashing algorithm, it will probably use both uplinks (toward S1 and S2) to send Ethernet frames to Z.
* Ethernet frames with the same source MAC address (A) will be encapsulated into VXLAN frames on S1 and S2 and sent toward Sx.
* Sx might receive frames from the same source MAC address coming from two different source VTEPs (S1 and S2). That will totally confuse Sx if it uses dynamic MAC learning to build MAC-to-VTEP mapping tables

**Conclusion**: S1 and S2 must use the same source IP address when encapsulating the traffic coming from a dual-attached (MLAG) host.

**Aside**: The requirement to use an anycast VTEP IP address complicates the device configuration. VTEP IP address is usually attached to a loopback interface, and IP addresses configured on loopback interfaces are commonly used to set OSPF or BGP router ID.

Having two routers with the same router ID in a network running a link-state routing protocol produces interesting results. To alleviate that pitfall, vendors usually recommend configuring two loopback interfaces[^SSH], and using a static IGP router ID to ensure the automatic process doesn't select the VTEP loopback interface as the source of router ID.

[^SSH]: In case you need a stable unique IP address per box.

**Back to VXLAN**. The use of anycast VTEP IP address has an interesting side effect: load balancing works out of the box. S1 and S2 are advertising the same IP address with the same cost, and assuming the VXLAN transport network uses a leaf-and-spine topology, traffic from host Z to host A uses both switches (based on the source UDP port in the VXLAN packets).

### Orphan Hosts

Orphan hosts are (as always) a source of pain. Imagine host X communicating with host Z:

* The traffic from X to Z will be encapsulated in VXLAN packets with anycast VTEP source IP address.
* Sx will use the anycast VTEP IP address to send the traffic from Z to X, and approximately half of those packets will end on the wrong egress switch (S2).
* S2 will have to use the peer link to send the packets received over the VXLAN fabric to X.

There's a simple solution to this conundrum: use a different source VTEP IP address when encapsulating Ethernet packets received from orphan hosts. To do that, your ASIC has to support:

* Multiple destination VTEP addresses per switch -- one for dual-attached hosts, another one for orphan hosts[^CPIP]
* Selecting the source VTEP address based on the ingress interface.

[^CPIP]: It looks like the ASICs used in Cisco Nexus switches can do that -- this is exactly the functionality required for their EVPN vPC Multihoming implementation.

Looking at various VXLAN implementations, it seems like the above requirements aren't exactly a walk in the park. Obviously we don't know what data center switch ASICs can do ([thanks a million](https://blog.ipspace.net/2016/05/what-are-problems-with-broadcom.html), Broadcom, NVIDIA and friends), and people who could answer that question are not allowed to, but if you could say something without violating an NDA signed in blood, or send me an anonymous hint, you'd be most welcome. 

Finally, this is the perfect moment for EVPN pundits to tell me how all the problems I just described get solved with EVPN multihoming. That's not exactly true, and we'll discuss the nuances in the next blog post in this series.

### Flooding Considerations

Now that we know how unicast forwarding works in MLAG clusters connected to a VXLAN fabric, let's see how complex the flooding of BUM packets is.

Outbound direction is easy: 

* Packets received from a host (orphan or MLAG-connected) are flooded to all other hosts, the peer link *and the VXLAN fabric*.
* Packets received from the peer link *should not be flooded to the VXLAN fabric*, as the MLAG peer already did that. From the perspective of the egress ACL discussed in [MLAG Layer-2 Flooding](/2022/06/mlag-deep-dive-flooding.html) blog post, VXLAN interface should be treated like an MLAG interface.

Now for the inbound direction, where the fabric could use IP multicast or ingress replication to flood BUM traffic.

When the VXLAN fabric uses **multicast-based** BUM flooding, all egress devices listening to the VNI IP multicast address receive all the flooded traffic, and the MLAG cluster members might have a fun time deciding who should forward the flooded packets to the MLAG hosts[^OHE].

The easiest solution to this challenge is to use a single MLAG cluster member as a dedicated flooder and register the VNI IP multicast address only on that node[^REGALL]. The Ethernet frames received from the VXLAN fabric would be flooded to all ports on the dedicated flooder -- including the peer link -- and the other member(s) of the MLAG cluster would use the exact [same procedures they used in standalone MLAG cluster](/2022/06/mlag-deep-dive-flooding.html).[^REGCOM]

[^REGALL]: Alternatively, all members of MLAG cluster could listen to the VNI IP multicast address, and everyone but the dedicated flooder ignores BUM packets received over the VXLAN interface. Not listening to IP multicast might be simpler ;)

[^REGCOM]: If you're keen on generating tons of interesting hardware bugs, you could go for a more complex implementation where all cluster members listen to the VNI IP multicast traffic, the dedicated flooder sends the VXLAN BUM packet to all local ports _but not the peer link_, and all other MLAG members send the VXLAN BUM packet only to the orphan ports. Have fun.

What about VXLAN fabrics using **ingress replication**? That's an even easier one. All MLAG cluster members advertise the same anycast VTEP IP address, and that address is used in the ingress replication lists on all other VTEPs. 

When an ingress VTEP sends a replicated BUM packet to the anycast VTEP IP address, it's received by a random MLAG cluster members. That switch can treat the flooded packet like it would be coming from an MLAG host: flood it to all other ports and the peer link. The [standard MLAG flooding procedures](/2022/06/mlag-deep-dive-flooding.html) take care of further flooding.

[^OHE]: Orphan hosts are easy ;)
