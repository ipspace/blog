[Etienne-Victor Depasquale](https://www.um.edu.mt/profile/etiennedepasquale), a researcher at University of Malta, is trying to figure out what technologies service providers use to build real-life metro-area networks, and what services they offer on top of that infrastructure.

If you happen to be involved with a metro area network, he'd love to hear from you -- [please fill in this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCKLr82hwoJSYUP4AuWHz2TgDjD3q_ezkbafPWZC8K_q9JGA/viewform) -- and he promised that he'll share the results of the survey with the participants.
