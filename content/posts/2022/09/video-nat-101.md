The last video in the 2-hour-long *[Network Addressing](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Net101#ADDR)* part of *[How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work)* discusses [Network Address Translation](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/NA6%20-%20Network%20Address%20Translation.mp4?doccode=Net101).

After watching it, you might want to spend some extra quality time (with a bit of soap opera vibe) enjoying the recent *â€Œ[Dual ISP deployment operational issues and uncertainties](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/v6ops/u0JH7vote1uQnYwWXMwQ1hxDuPw/)* thread on the v6ops mailing list with a "surprising" result: [NPTv6 or NAT66 is the least horrible way to do it](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/v6ops/KLco291CsytXvDGa-GBd1y5JOh8/).
