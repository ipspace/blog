In the [last blog post in the *VLANs and VRFs in netlab*](/2022/06/netsim-vlan-vrf.html) series, I described how we can combine VLANs and VRFs and create a VRF Lite solution with stretched VLANs. Wonder how hard would it be to create a routed multi-hop [VRF Lite](/2022/04/netsim-vrf-lite.html) topology? It's trivial.

Let's start with the nodes. We won't need any extra attributes on individual nodes, so we can define them as a simple list:

```
nodes: [r1, r2, r3, h1, h2, h3, h4 ]
```

Next, we'll define two groups: Linux *hosts* and *routers*. We won't define the device type in the *routers* group so you can use [whatever devices you want](https://netlab.tools/platforms/) as long as they [support VLANs, VRFs and OSPF](https://netlab.tools/platforms/#supported-configuration-modules) -- the [configuration modules](https://netlab.tools/module-reference/) we need to get the virtual interfaces and routing protocols up and running.

```
groups:
  routers:
    members: [ r1,r2,r3 ]
    module: [ vlan,vrf,ospf ]
  hosts:
    device: linux
    members: [ h1,h2,h3,h4 ]
```

Next, we need two VRFs and two VLANs (one per VRF). The magic trick that makes VRF Lite work is **mode: route** in VLAN definition that changes VLANs from a stretched bridging thingy to an interface encapsulation thingy -- a different IP subnet is assigned to the VLAN instance on every physical link.

```
vrfs:
  red:
  blue:

vlans:
  red:
    mode: route
    vrf: red
  blue:
    mode: route
    vrf: blue
```

Speaking of links: here's the list of links. The links between routers are VLAN trunks; the links between hosts and routers are simple Ethernet interfaces in VRFs:

```
links:
- r1:
  r2:
  vlan.trunk: [ red, blue ]
- r2:
  r3:
  vlan.trunk: [ red, blue ]  
- h1:
  r1:
    vrf: red
- h3:
  r1:
    vrf: blue
- h2:
  r3:
    vrf: red
- h4:
  r3:
    vrf: blue
```

That's it. Execute **netlab up -d _your-device_**[^HW] (after downloading the [final topology file](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/blob/master/VLAN/vlan-trunk-vrf/topology.yml)) and you'll have a multi-VRF lab using VLAN trunks.

[^HW]: Assuming you completed your homework, [installed the software](https://netlab.tools/install/), and created a Vagrant box for your network devices.

Here are the relevant parts of Arista EOS configuration in case you're wondering what we achieved with this simple lab topology file:
