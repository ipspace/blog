title: 'netlab Release 1.3.3: Bug Fixes'
---
Just FYI: I pushed out [*netlab*](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/) release 1.3.3 yesterday. It's a purely bug fix release, new functionality and a few breaking changes are coming in release 1.4 in a few weeks.

[Some of the bugs we fixed](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release/1.3.html#bug-fixes-in-release-1-3-3) weren't exactly pleasant; if you're using release 1.3.2 you might want to upgrade with `pip3 install --upgrade networklab`.
