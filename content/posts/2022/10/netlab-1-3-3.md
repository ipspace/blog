title: 'netlab Release 1.3.3: Bug Fixes'
---
Just FYI: I pushed out [*netlab*](https://netlab.tools/) release 1.3.3 yesterday. It's a purely bug fix release, new functionality and a few breaking changes are coming in release 1.4 in a few weeks.

[Some of the bugs we fixed](https://netlab.tools/release/1.3/#bug-fixes-in-release-1-3-3) weren't exactly pleasant; if you're using release 1.3.2 you might want to upgrade with `pip3 install --upgrade networklab`.
