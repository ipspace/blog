In this week's update of the *[Data Center Infrastructure for Networking Engineers](https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Infrastructure_for_Networking_Engineers)* webinar, we talked about VLANs, VRFs, and modern data center fabrics.

Those videos are available with [Standard or Expert ipSpace.net Subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/); if you're still sitting on the fence, you might want to watch the [_how networks really work_ version of the same topic](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/BR4.1%20-%20Bridging%20Beyond%20Spanning%20Tree%20Protocol.mp4?doccode=Net101) that's available with [Free Subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free) -- it describes the principles-of-operation of bridging fabrics that don't use STP (TRILL, SPBM, VXLAN, EVPN)
