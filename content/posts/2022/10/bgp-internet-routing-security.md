I'm always a bit in a bind when I get an invitation to speak at a security conference (after all, I know just enough about security to make a fool of myself), but when the organizers of the [DEEP Conference](https://deep-conference.com/) invited me to talk about Internet routing security I simply couldn't resist -- the topic is dear and near to my heart, and I planned to do a  related webinar for a very long time.

The [slides for the conference talk](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=BGPSec) are already online (available with [standard subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual)). I plan to add tons of details -- the slot in the conference agenda is 45 minutes long, and you know I can always spend an hour or two on any interesting-enough topic -- and have a [live webinar session](https://www.ipspace.net/Internet_Routing_Security) sometime during the winter.

That also gives you a perfect opportunity to influence what's in the webinar. Review the slide deck and tell me which of the topics mentioned in it you find most interesting and what details you'd like to see.
