Jeroen Van Bemmel created another interesting *[netlab](https://netlab.tools/)* topology: [EVPN/VXLAN between SR Linux fabric and FRR on Linux hosts](https://srlinux-at-your-service.medium.com/revisiting-bgp-evpn-vxlan-to-the-hosts-with-sr-linux-22-6-3-586df95f730c) based on his work implementing VRFs, VXLAN, and EVPN on FRR in [netlab release 1.3.1](https://netlab.tools/release/1.3/).

**Bonus point**: he also described how to do multi-vendor interoperability testing with *netlab*.

If only he wouldn't be publishing his articles on a platform that's almost as user-data-craving as Google.
