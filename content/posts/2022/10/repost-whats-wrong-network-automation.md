Responding to my *[Infrastructure as Code Sounds Scary](/2022/09/infrastructure-as-code-sounds-scary.html)* blog post, [Deepak Arora](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anetworkartist/) posted an interesting (and unfortunately way too accurate) [list of challenges](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ivanpepelnjak_infrastructure-as-code-sounds-scary-ipspacenet-activity-6975503760752050176-x2b6/) you might encounter when trying to introduce network automation in an enterprise environment.

He graciously allowed me to repost his thoughts on my blog.

Why don't we agree on that :
<!--more-->
1. Automation never really took off well despite all efforts from vendors and communities side. My best guess is even today close to 80% of network infrastructure is deployed and managed in a manual fashion. The ratios might be bit here and there and I can imagine North America as region would be ahead of everyone else.

2. Most automation engineers I have interviewed in the past couple of years had absolutely no idea about how to sell it to management for seeking investment. At best they will often be found throwing another set of marketing slides at them.

3. Let's admit that when we ask people what network automation really means and can do, 90% of people will just spell out "Python, DevOps, Ansible and Terraform".

4. How many engineers in the network automation community treat is as an architecture in itself rather than as a very tactical thingy?

Automation is a great tool like many others available to the network engineering community, but most of them are still looking at it as if it is a silver bullet, and being very tactical in their approach.

I was trying to address #4 (and a bit of #2) in [automation webinars](https://www.ipspace.net/Roadmap/Network_Automation_webinars) and the [network automation online course](https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions), but according to Deepak's feedback it looks I wasn't making much of an impact.
