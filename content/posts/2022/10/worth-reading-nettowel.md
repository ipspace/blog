A few months ago, Urs Baumann created [NetTowel](https://github.com/InfrastructureAsCode-ch/nettowel), a very nice CLI wrapper around several popular libraries, including Jinja2, TTP, NetMiko and netaddr. Although it seems he got busy with other things in recent months, and the development stalled a bit, the tool is definitely worth exploring.
