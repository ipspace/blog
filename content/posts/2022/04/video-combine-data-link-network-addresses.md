The previous videos in the _[How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work)_ webinar described some interesting details of data-link layer addresses and network layer addresses. Now for the final bit: how do we map an adjacent network address into a per-interface data link layer address? 

If you answered ARP (or ND if you happen to be of IPv6 persuasion) you're absolutely right... but is that the only way? Watch the _[Combining Data-Link- and Network Addresses](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/NA3.3%20-%20Combining%20Data-Link%20and%20Network%20Addresses.mp4?doccode=Net101)_ video to find out.
