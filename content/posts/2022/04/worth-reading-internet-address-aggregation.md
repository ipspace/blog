Every now and then someone tells me how much better the global Internet would be if only we were using recursive layers (RINA) and hierarchical addresses. I always answer "_that's a business problem, not a technical one, and [you cannot solve business problems by throwing technology at them](/2014/09/youve-been-doing-same-thing-for-last-20.html)_", but of course that has never persuaded anyone who hasn't been running a large-enough business for long enough.

Geoff Huston is doing a much better job in the 
[March 2022 ISP Column](https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2022-03/ietf113-iepg.html) -- read the _Higher Levels of Address Aggregation_, and if you still need more technical details, there's 30+ pages of [RFC 4984](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4984.html).
