Straight from the "Bad Ideas Never Die" (see also RFC 1925 Rule 11) department: Geoff Huston [described a proposal to use hop-by-hop IPv6 extension headers to implement Path MTU Discovery](https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2022-04/hopbyhop.html). In his words:

> It is a rare situation when you can create an outcome from two somewhat broken technologies where the outcome is not also broken.

IETF should put rules in place similar to the ones used by the patent office (Thou Shalt Not Patent [Perpetual Motion Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_motion)), but unfortunately we're way past that point. Back to Geoff:

> It appears that the IETF has decided that volume is far easier to achieve than quality. These days, what the IETF is generating as RFCs is pretty much what the IETF accused the OSI folk of producing back then: Nothing more than voluminous paperware about vapourware!
