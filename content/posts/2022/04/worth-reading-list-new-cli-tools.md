Julia Evans published a [long list of new(ish) Linux command line tools](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/04/12/a-list-of-new-ish--command-line-tools/). For example, did you ever want to have directory listing in nicely formatted JSON? How about `ls -l | jc --ls | jq .`?

Quite a few of these tools also work on Mac and can be installed with HomeBrew. Some are written in a scripting language, so you could (in theory) also use them on Windows (without WSL).
