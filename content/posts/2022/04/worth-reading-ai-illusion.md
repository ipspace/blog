[Russ White](https://rule11.tech/)'s Weekend Reads are full of gems, including a recent pointer to the [AI Illusion – State&#x2d;of&#x2d;the&#x2d;Art Chatbots Aren&#8217;t What They Seem](https://mindmatters.ai/2022/03/the-ai-illusion-state-of-the-art-chatbots-arent-what-they-seem/) article. It starts with "_Artificial intelligence is an oxymoron. Despite all the incredible things computers can do, they are still not intelligent in any meaningful sense of the word._" and it only gets better.

While the article focuses on natural language processing (GPT-3 model), I see no reason why we should expect better performance from AI in networking (see also: _[AI/ML in Networking -- The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly](https://www.ipspace.net/AI_and_ML_in_Networking)_).
