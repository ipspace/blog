title: Creating VRF Lite Labs With netlab
---
I always found VRF lab setups a chore. On top of the usual IPAM tasks you have to create VRFs, assign route targets and route distinguishers, do that on every PE-router in your lab... before you can start working on interesting things.

I tried to remove as much friction as I could with the *netlab* [VRF configuration module](https://netlab.tools/module/vrf/) -- let me walk you through a few simple examples[^FANBOY] which will also serve to [illustrate the VRF configuration differences between Cisco IOS and Arista EOS](/2022/04/netsim-vrf-lite/#differences).

[^FANBOY]: Yes, I'm a fanboy, but it's a great tool ;)

## Single PE Router, Two VRFs

Ignoring the trivial case (single VRF, single PE-router), the next simplest possible scenario has two VRFs (red and blue) on a single PE-router:

{{<figure src="/2022/04/vrf-lite-simple.png">}}

You need just a few lines to describe the VRFs in [*netlab* topology file](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/blob/master/VRF/vrf-lite-hosts/multi-vrf.yml):

{{<cc>}}VRF definitions{{</cc>}}
```config
vrfs:
  red:
  blue:
```

That's it. RD and RT values are assigned automatically, and you get user-friendly names you can use in link definitions.

{{<note info>}}*netlab* uses 2-byte-AS RT/RD format. If you don't use BGP in your lab, the default AS number is taken from the `vrf.as` global parameter which has the default value of 65000. RT/RD values for *red* VRF will thus be set to 65000:1.{{</note>}}

Next, we have to define the lab devices. We'll use Linux hosts and an Arista EOS router in the middle (the router needs VRF configuration module).

{{<cc>}}Lab devices{{</cc>}}
```config
defaults.device: linux

nodes:
  rtr:
    module: [ vrf ]
    device: eos
  h1:
  h2:
  h3:
  h4:
```

The interesting part of the topology file is the *links* section where I had to specify VRFs on the PE-router connection to each link:

```config
links:
- rtr: { vrf: red }
  h1:
- rtr: { vrf: red } 
  h2:
- rtr: { vrf: blue }
  h3:
- rtr: { vrf: blue }
  h4:
```

And that's it. If you have a Ubuntu host handy:

* [Install *netlab*](https://netlab.tools/install/ubuntu/)
* Use `netlab install ubuntu ansible containerlab` to install all software packages
* [Install Arista cEOS container](https://netlab.tools/install/ubuntu/)
* Copy [topology file](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/blob/master/VRF/vrf-lite-hosts/multi-vrf.yml) into an empty directory
* Execute `netlab up -p clab multi-vrf.yml` to start the lab ([more details](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/tree/master/VRF/vrf-lite-hosts))

After a few minutes, you'll have a fully configured lab -- H1 will be able to ping H2, and H3 will be able to ping H4. Here's the Arista EOS configuration generated by **netlab up** or **netlab initial** command.

{{<note info>}}Arista EOS configures route distinguishers in VRF instances and route targets in BGP process. No route targets are configured in this setup as we have no VRF route leaking.{{</note>}}

{{<cc>}}Simple VRF configuration on Arista EOS{{</cc>}}
```
vrf instance blue
   rd 65000:2
!

   rd 65000:1

   description rtr -> [h1] [stub]
   mac-address 52:dc:ca:fe:01:01
   vrf red
   ip address 172.16.0.1/24
!
interface Ethernet2
   description rtr -> [h2] [stub]
   mac-address 52:dc:ca:fe:01:02
   vrf red

   description rtr -> [h3] [stub]
   mac-address 52:dc:ca:fe:01:03
   vrf blue
   ip address 172.16.2.1/24

   description rtr -> [h4] [stub]
   mac-address 52:dc:ca:fe:01:04

   ip address 172.16.3.1/24
!
interface Loopback0
   ip address 10.0.0.1/32
!
ip routing
ip routing vrf blue
ip routing vrf red
!
end
```

If you start the lab with a router running Cisco IOS (execute `‌netlab up -s nodes.rtr.device=csr multi-vrf.yml`), you'll get the following router configuration:

```
vrf definition blue
 rd 65000:2
 route-target export 65000:2
 route-target import 65000:2
 !
 address-family ipv4
 exit-address-family
!
vrf definition red
 rd 65000:1
 route-target export 65000:1
 route-target import 65000:1
 !
 address-family ipv4
 exit-address-family
!
interface GigabitEthernet2
 description rtr -> [h1] [stub]
 vrf forwarding red
 ip address 172.16.0.1 255.255.255.0
!
interface GigabitEthernet3
 description rtr -> [h2] [stub]
 vrf forwarding red
 ip address 172.16.1.1 255.255.255.0
!
interface GigabitEthernet4
 description rtr -> [h3] [stub]
 vrf forwarding blue
 ip address 172.16.2.1 255.255.255.0
!
interface GigabitEthernet5
 description rtr -> [h4] [stub]
 vrf forwarding blue
 ip address 172.16.3.1 255.255.255.0
```

Not too shabby for a few lines of YAML, right? But wait, it gets better...

### Overlapping VPNs and VRF Route Leaking

VRFs become fun when you're trying to implement non-trivial topologies like overlapping- or shared services VPNs. Let's try out the simplest possible overlapping VPN topology: two hosts accessing a common server:

{{<figure src="/2022/04/vrf-lite-common.png">}}

The easiest way to implement overlapping VPN topology is to play with the route targets:

* *red* VRF should import *red* and *common* routes
* *blue* VRF should import *blue* and *common* routes
* *common* VRF should import *common*, *red* and *blue* routes

{{<note info>}}In a single-router setup you don't have to import routes into the same VRF (example: *red* routes into *red* VRF), but it's good to get things right from the start or you'll have fun troubleshooting session when you'll try to migrate this scenario into a multi-node MPLS/VPN setup.{{</note>}}

Defining these requirements in [*netlab* lab topology file](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/blob/master/VRF/vrf-lite-hosts/vrf-route-leaking.yml) is as simple as this:

{{<cc>}}VRF definition for overlapping VPN service{{</cc>}}
```
vrfs:
  red:
    import: [ red, common ]
  blue:
    import: [ blue, common ]
  common:
    import: [ red, blue, common ]
```

As before, the system allocates RD and RT values, and you can use VRF names instead of RT/RD values to specify import route targets.

{{<note info>}}The default value for import and export route targets is the VRF RD. All three VRFs export their routes with a single route target.{{</note>}}

There's nothing new in the device- and link definitions:

{{<cc>}}Overlapping VPN services: node and link definitions{{</cc>}}
```
defaults.device: linux

nodes:
  rtr:
    module: [ vrf ]
    device: eos
  h1:
  h2:
  srv:

links:
- rtr: { vrf: red }
  h1:
- rtr: { vrf: blue } 
  h2:
- rtr: { vrf: common }
  srv:
```

Start this lab using the same commands as before (replace `multi-vrf.yml` with `vrf-route-leaking.yml`), and you'll get the following parameters configured on the Arista EOS router:

* VRFs are defined with `vrf instance` commands
* Interfaces are assigned to VRFs
* IP routing is started in VRFs with `ip routing vrf` commands
* VRF route leaking is implemented through BGP -- a BGP process is started using the default `vrf.as` AS number
* VRFs and import/export route targets are defined in the BGP routing process

Here's the final (VRF-related) Arista EOS configuration generated during the lab startup process:

      route-target export vpn-ipv4 65000:1
      router-id 10.0.0.1
      redistribute connected
```

It's interesting to compare Arista EOS VRF route leaking configuration with Cisco IOS one:
{#differences}

* Import/export route targets are defined in `vrf definition` on Cisco IOS. They are defined within `vrf` section of `router bgp` configuration on Arista EOS.
* IPv4/IPv6 address families have to be configured within a `vrf definition` on Cisco IOS. `ip routing` has to be configured for each VRF on Arista EOS.
* VRFs are defined as `address-family` within a BGP process on Cisco IOS. Arista EOS uses `vrf` sections within `router bgp` configuration.

Told you -- labbing VRFs has never been easier ;)

### Build Your Own

You'll find the [lab topology files on GitHub](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/tree/master/VRF/vrf-lite-hosts). To use them:

* [Install *netlab*](https://netlab.tools/install/) and your preferred lab environment. These days I find it easiest to use Arista cEOS with containerlab.
* Copy [topology files](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/tree/master/VRF/vrf-lite-hosts) into an empty directory
* Execute **netlab up** with the parameters described above.
