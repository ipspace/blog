title: 'Worth Reading: Full-Stack Network Automation'

LÃ­vio Zanol Puppim published a series of blog posts describing a [full-stack network automation](https://livio.zanol.com.br/full-stack-it-automation-part-1), including GitOps with GitLab, handling secrets with Hashicorp Vault, using Ansible and AWX to run automation scripts, continuous integration with Gitlab CI Runner, and topped it off with a REST API and React-based user interface.

You might not want to use the exact same components, but it's probably worthwhile going through his solution and [explore the source code](https://github.com/liviozanol/full-stack_automation). He's also looking for any comments or feedback you might have on how to improve what he did.
