Remember the *[Cloud Models, Layers and Responsibilities](/2019/12/video-cloud-models-layers-and.html)* video by [Matthias Luft](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Matthias_Luft)? He continued his introduction of cloud services with *Cloud Services Hierarchy*, explained the differences between *infrastructure*, *platform*, *function* and *software* as a service, and concluded with a *there's no free lunch* message.
