Tom Hollingsworth published a [more eloquent version of what I've been saying for ages](https://networkingnerd.net/2022/01/28/the-network-does-too-much/):

* Complexity belongs to the end nodes;
* Network should provide end-to-end packet transport, not a fix for every stupidity someone managed to push down the stack;
* There's nothing wrong with being a well-performing utility instead of pretending your stuff is working on unicorn farts and fairy dust.

Obviously it's totally against the vested interest of any networking vendor out there to admit it.
