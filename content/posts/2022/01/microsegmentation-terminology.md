While I liked reading the *[Where to Stick the Firewall](https://netcraftsmen.com/where-to-stick-the-firewall-part-1/)* blog post by Peter Welcher, it bothered me a bit that he used *microsegmentation* to mean *security groups*.

I know that *microsegmentation* became approximately as well-defined as *cloud* or *SDN*[^MSG], but let's aim our shiny lance [^SL] at the nearest windmill and gallop away...

[^SL]: It's been neatly polished during the New Year break

[^MSG]: Gartner [claims to have](https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2017/03/21/microsegmentation/) *an official definition*, but it's behind a paywall so whatever.

The way it was initially defined[^VMD], **microsegmentation** is the ability to protect **every individual endpoint**, which means a packet filter in front of every VM, container, or end-user device. You get that level of protection in most cloud environments, with VMware NSX Distributed Firewall, or with Cisco ACI (to some extent[^ACIV]).

[^VMD]: IIRC: by VMware at the NSX launch

[^ACIV]: Cisco ACI has a problem with virtual endpoints on VMware ESXi as they cannot control the VMware virtual switch. I have no idea how the [Application Virtual Switch](https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/03/running-vsphere-on-cisco-aci-think-twice.html) SNAFU ended; the usual workarounds are _run virtual switch in a VM_ or _run private VLANs_. Oh, the beauties of [fixing suboptimal architecture](https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/06/network-virtualization-and-spaghetti.html) with complex kludges.

The packet filters in front of the endpoints could be stateless (Cisco ACI[^SESS]), stateful (AWS or Azure security groups), or have some deep packet inspection capabilities (VMware NSX).

[^SESS]: Per-session 5-tuples needed to implement stateful packet filters cannot fit into any reasonably sized TCAM -- another wonderful side effect of insisting on using the wrong hammer for the job.

Then we have *Security groups* or *security tags*. They could be just a convenient configuration mechanisms (in most cases) or data-plane markers (Cisco ACI) that simplify packet filters[^SCALE]... but they are nothing more than another application of RFC 1925 Rule 6. Regardless of PowerPoint-promised magic and dancing unicorns, the traffic filtering rules using *object tags* or *sets of objects* have to be transformed into the usual 5-tuple packet filters (modulo optimizations like object groups). Thereâ€™s no other way to do it at reasonable speed.

[^SCALE]: See [Scaling the Cloud Security Groups](https://blog.ipspace.net/2014/11/scaling-cloud-security-groups.html) for more details.

Finally, while [Matthias Luft somewhat disagrees with me](https://blog.ipspace.net/series/host-firewalls.html), I think the microsegmentation packet filter should be outside of the protected endpoint to prevent root exploits from disabling it.
