In the _[Local Area Network Addressing](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/NA2.2%20-%20Local%20Area%20Network%20Addressing.mp4?doccode=Net101)_ video (part of _[How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work)_ webinar) I covered numerous obscure LAN addressing details including:

* There's no layer-2 address in Fibre Channel frames (because [FC is routing not bridging](https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/07/is-fibre-channel-switching-bridging-or.html));
* Why is the multicast bit lowest bit (0x01) in first byte on Ethernet but highest bit (0x80) on Token Ring or FDDI;
* How some NIC manufacturers never got the memo on what OUI really means.
