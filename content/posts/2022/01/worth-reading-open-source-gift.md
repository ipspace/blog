I'm positive that this pointer to _[The Gift of It's Your Problem Now](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20211229)_ by Avery Pennarun will generate similar comments to the [blockchain one](/2021/11/worth-reading-bitcoin-fail/): "_he's an idiot, and you're an idiot for wasting my time posting this_".

That might be true, but in that case he's my kind of idiot, and you shouldn't complain about a gift anyway -- there are tons of high-quality lolcats videos waiting for you instead.
