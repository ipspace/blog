title: 'Worth Reading: Egress Anycast in Cloudflare Network'

Cloudflare has been using [ingress anycast](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/11/anycast-principles.html) (advertising the same set of prefixes from all data centers) for ages. Now they did a giant leap forward and implemented another "_this thing can never work_" technology: egress anycast. Servers from multiple data centers use source addresses from the prefix that's advertised by all data centers.

Not only that, in the long-established tradition they [described their implementation](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-servers-dont-own-ips-anymore/) in enough details that someone determined enough could go and implement it (as opposed to the typical _[look how awesome our secret sauce is](https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/11/worth-reading-ai-replication-self-promotion.html)_ approach from Google).
