[Two hundred forty](/2022/) blog posts and [sixteen webinar sessions](https://www.ipspace.net/Webinars/#Recent_webinars) later, it's time for yet another "year gone by" blog post -- I'm shutting down my virtual office and will disappear until mid-January. I'll read my email should someone experience an urgent support problem but won't reply to 90% of the other stuff coming in.

I hope you'll find a few days to disconnect from the crazy pace of the networking world, forget all the marketing shenanigans you encountered in 2022, and focus on your loved ones. I would also like to wish you all the best in 2023!

Finally, I couldn't resist posting a few teasers of what's coming in early 2023[^SITG]:
