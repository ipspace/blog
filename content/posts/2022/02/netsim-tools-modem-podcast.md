A few weeks ago, [Nick Buraglio](https://www.ipspace.net/Expert:Nick_Buraglio) and [Chris Cummings](https://slash64.tech/) invited me for an [hour-long chat about netsim-tools on the Modem Podcast](https://www.modem.show/post/s02e01/).

We talked about why one might want to use [netsim-tools](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) instead of another lab orchestration solution and the high-level functionality offered by the tool. Nick particularly loved its IPAM features which got so extensive in the meantime that I had to write a [full-blown addressing tutorial](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example/addressing-tutorial.html). But there's so much more: you can also get a fully configured OSPFv2, OSPFv3, EIGRP, IS-IS, SRv6, or BGP lab built from [more than a dozen different devices](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/platforms.html). In short (as Nick and Chris said): you can use netsim-tools to make labbing less miserable.
