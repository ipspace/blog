title: netsim-tools (now netlab) on the Modem Podcast
---
A few weeks ago, [Nick Buraglio](https://www.ipspace.net/Expert:Nick_Buraglio) and [Chris Cummings](https://slash64.tech/) invited me for an [hour-long chat about netlab on the Modem Podcast](https://www.modem.show/post/s02e01/)[^NL].

[^NL]: *netlab* was known as *netsim-tools* when we were recording that podcast.

We talked about why one might want to use [netlab](https://netlab.tools/) instead of another lab orchestration solution and the high-level functionality offered by the tool. Nick particularly loved its IPAM features which got so extensive in the meantime that I had to write a [full-blown addressing tutorial](https://netlab.tools/example/addressing-tutorial/). But there's so much more: you can also get a fully configured OSPFv2, OSPFv3, EIGRP, IS-IS, SRv6, or BGP lab built from [more than a dozen different devices](https://netlab.tools/platforms/). In short (as Nick and Chris said): you can use netlab to make labbing less miserable.
