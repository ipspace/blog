title: 'Using netlab with containerlab: Welcome to the World of Tomorrow'
---
Julio Perez wrote a wonderful blog post describing how he 
[combined netlab and containerlab](https://juliopdx.com/2022/02/13/network-simulation-tools-and-containerlab/)[^NL] to build Arista cEOS labs.

[^NL]: *netlab* was known as *netsim-tools* at the time he wrote the blog post

**Hint**: when you're done with that blog post, keep reading and add his blog to your RSS feed -- he wrote some great stuff in the past.
