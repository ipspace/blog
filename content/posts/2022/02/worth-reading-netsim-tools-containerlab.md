Julio Perez wrote a wonderful blog post describing how he 
[combined netsim-tools and containerlab](https://juliopdx.com/2022/02/13/network-simulation-tools-and-containerlab/) to build Arista cEOS labs.

**Hint**: when you're done with that blog post, keep reading and add his blog to your RSS feed -- he wrote some great stuff in the past.
