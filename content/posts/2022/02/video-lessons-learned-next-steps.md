I tried to wrap up my [Lessons Learned](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetBiz#LL) presentation on a [positive note](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/NetBiz/L5%20-%20The%20Way%20Forward.mp4?doccode=NetBiz): what are some of the things you can do to avoid all the traps and pitfalls I encountered in the almost four decades of working in networking industry:

* Get invited to architecture and design meetings when a new application project starts.
* Always try to figure out what the [underlying actual business needs are](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetBiz#BF).
* Just because you can doesn't mean that you should.
* Keep it as simple as possible, but no simpler.
* Work with your peers and explain how networking works and why you face certain limitations.
* Humans are not perfect -- automate as much as it makes sense, but no more.
