Here's another BGP Route Reflector myth:

> In a redundant design, you should use Route Reflector Cluster ID to avoid loops.

TL&DR: No.

While BGP route reflectors [can cause permanent forwarding loops](https://blog.ipspace.net/2013/10/can-bgp-route-reflectors-really.html) in sufficiently broken topologies, the Cluster ID was never needed to stop a routing update propagation loop:
<!--more-->
* The only way to generate an update propagation loop is a cycle of route reflectors with every route reflector being a client of other route reflectors[^LOOP]
* Even in that case, every RR adds its cluster ID (router ID is used as the default value) to the *cluster list* attribute on every reflected BGP prefix, and checks the *cluster list* on incoming updates.

**Long story short**: *cluster list* serves the same role within an autonomous system as *AS path* does across autonomous systems (without the plethora of nerd knobs that would allow you to turn off sanity checks).

[^LOOP]: The proof is left as an exercise for the reader.

OK, so it looks like we don't need to set *cluster id* on route reflectors -- the update loops are detected in any case and life is good. As always things aren't as simple as they look; it's time for an analogy: if you squint just right, an autonomous system with a set of route reflectors and clients looks an awful lot like a leaf-and-spine fabric (route reflectors are spines, RR clients are leafs).

In an EBGP leaf-and-spine fabric we commonly use the same AS number on all spines to prevent *path hunting*. Using the analogy, it seems that we should use the same *cluster ID* on all route reflectors. Fortunately, route reflector path hunting isn't nearly as bad as EBGP path hunting.

Never heard of *path hunting*? Let's see what's going on behind the scenes, using the [simplest possible lab topology](https://github.com/ipspace/netsim-examples/tree/master/BGP/RR-cluster-id):

### Without Route Reflector Cluster ID

Without BGP Route Reflector Cluster ID configured on RR1 and RR2, the following updates are sent when PE1 advertises its loopback:

* PE1 sends an update to RR1 and RR2
* RR1 and RR2 reflect the updates to each other, PE2, and PE1[^UG]
* PE1 ignores the received update because it's router ID matches the *originator* attribute.
* PE2 installs both updates in BGP RIB and selects one of them as the best route.
* RR1 and RR2 install the reflected update from the other route reflector in BGP RIB and ignore it because it's not the best route (due to *cluster list* length).

[^UG]: PE1 and PE2 are in the same BGP update group. PE1 thus receives a [reflected update of its own announcement](https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/04/bgp-route-reflector-update-groups.html).

{{<cc>}}BGP RIB entries for PE1 loopback (10.0.0.3) on RR1{{</cc>}}
```
rr1#sh ip bgp 10.0.0.3
BGP routing table entry for 10.0.0.3/32, version 9
Paths: (2 available, best #2, table default, RIB-failure(17))
  Advertised to update-groups:
     1          2
  Refresh Epoch 1
  Local
    10.0.0.3 (metric 20) from 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2)
      Origin IGP, metric 0, localpref 100, valid, internal
      Originator: 10.0.0.3, Cluster list: 10.0.0.2
      rx pathid: 0, tx pathid: 0
  Refresh Epoch 2
  Local, (Received from a RR-client)
    10.0.0.3 (metric 20) from 10.0.0.3 (10.0.0.3)
      Origin IGP, metric 0, localpref 100, valid, internal, best
      rx pathid: 0, tx pathid: 0x0
```

When PE1 shuts down (simulated with **no router bgp 65000** configuration command) it closes the BGP session with RR1 and RR2 (debugging printouts were collected on RR1):

```
%BGP-5-NBR_RESET: Neighbor 10.0.0.3 reset (Peer closed the session)
%BGP-5-ADJCHANGE: neighbor 10.0.0.3 Down Peer closed the session
%BGP_SESSION-5-ADJCHANGE: neighbor 10.0.0.3 IPv4 Unicast topology base removed from session
```

RR1 removes the original route from PE1 and finds an alternate route in BGP RIB -- the reflected update received from RR2:

```
Revise route installing 1 of 1 routes for 10.0.0.3/32 -> 10.0.0.3(global) to main IP table
```

As RR1 is now using a route from RR2, it sends an *unreachable* update[^WM] to RR2:

[^WM]: Technically, a WITHDRAW BGP message

```
BGP(0): (base) 10.0.0.2 send unreachable (format) 10.0.0.3/32
```

It also sends a modified version of the 10.0.0.3/32 prefix (that we know is bogus, but RR1 doesn't) to PE2:

```
BGP(0): (base) 10.0.0.4 send UPDATE (format) 10.0.0.3/32, next 10.0.0.3, metric 0, path Local
```

RR2 goes though the same steps and arrives at the same conclusions (including sending an *unreachable* update to RR1). Immediately after sending an update to PE2, RR1 receives an update from RR2 saying _hey, I have no idea where 10.0.0.3 is_:
 
```
BGP(0): 10.0.0.2 rcv UPDATE about 10.0.0.3/32 -- withdrawn
BGP(0): no valid path for 10.0.0.3/32
BGP: topo global:IPv4 Unicast:base Remove_fwdroute for 10.0.0.3/32
```

As the final step, RR1 has to send yet another update to PE2 saying _gee, I was wrong -- I have no idea where 10.0.0.3/32 is_:

```
BGP(0): (base) 10.0.0.4 send unreachable (format) 10.0.0.3/32
```

### The Impact of BGP Route Reflector Cluster ID

With the same RR Cluster ID configured on RR1 and RR2, RR1 rejects a reflected update coming from RR2:

```
BGP: 10.0.0.2 RR in same cluster. Reflected update dropped
BGP(0): 10.0.0.2 rcv UPDATE w/ attr: nexthop 10.0.0.3, origin i, localpref 100,
  metric 0, originator 10.0.0.3, clusterlist 10.0.0.1...
BGP(0): 10.0.0.2 rcv UPDATE about 10.0.0.3/32 -- DENIED due to: reflected from the same cluster;
```

There's also no path hunting after the session with PE1 fails. RR1 has no alternate path in its BGP RIB and immediately sends an *unreachable* update to PE2:

```
%BGP-5-NBR_RESET: Neighbor 10.0.0.3 reset (Peer closed the session)
BGP(0): no valid path for 10.0.0.3/32
BGP(0): (base) 10.0.0.2 send unreachable (format) 10.0.0.3/32
BGP(0): (base) 10.0.0.4 send unreachable (format) 10.0.0.3/32
```

### To Cluster or Not To Cluster?

Based on the above, it seems like we should be using *cluster ID* on route reflectors to reduce the amount of BGP updates. On the other hand, similar to [removing IBGP session between route reflectors](/2022/02/bgp-rr-myths.html), setting the *cluster ID* on route reflectors reduces the resilience of the design -- a misbehaving BGP session combined with a route reflector crash (or two lost BGP sessions) could result in connectivity loss similar to the [impact of valley-free routing](https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/09/valley-free-routing-in-data-center.html).

The decision becomes simpler if you use more than two route reflectors[^MRR]:

[^MRR]: There's usually no need to do that, but bear with me

* The probability of connectivity loss is significantly lower -- you'd need more than two strategically placed failures to get there;
* The BGP update traffic goes through the roof, particularly if you set IBGP update timers to zero to speed up the convergence[^AEX].

[^AEX]: Another exercise for an interested reader

As always, you have to identify the tradeoffs (BGP update traffic versus resiliency) and choose the design that fits your requirements -- the state that's best summarized with *It Depends™*
