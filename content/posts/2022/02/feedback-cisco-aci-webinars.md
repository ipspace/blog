I just wanted to pass you my feedback about the documentation and content of the above webinars. Excellent content, very well organized. 

My expectation is always high about your content because I’ve become used to it with other webinars you published. I always look for non-marketing content to understand the technology. 

I don’t want to criticize vendors based on assumptions or personal agendas from interested people but evaluate whether or not it is the right path forward for the problem I want to solve, knowing the pros and cons. So again, both webinars about Cisco ACI have given me excellent visibility of the solution. Thank you very much!
