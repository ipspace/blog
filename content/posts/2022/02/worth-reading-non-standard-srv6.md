Years ago, I [compared EVPN to SIP](https://blog.ipspace.net/2017/02/evpn-all-that-glitters-is-not-gold.html) -- it has a gazillion options, and every vendor implements a different subset of them, making interoperability a nightmare.

According to Andrew Alston, [SRv6 is no better](https://medium.com/@AndrewLiquid/non-standard-standards-srv6-aa7b360e8e20) (while being a [security nightmare](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/11/worth-reading-srv6-insecure.html)). No surprise there.
