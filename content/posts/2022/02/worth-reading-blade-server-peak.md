Stumbled upon a [totally unexpected fun fact](http://www.bladesmadesimple.com/2022/01/are-vendors-getting-out-of-the-blade-server-market/):

> Every server vendor either peaked or hits the peak of maximum units sold per quarter in 2015. In the years that follow, the monthly averages drop.

Keep that in mind the next time Cisco sales team comes along with a UCS presentation.
