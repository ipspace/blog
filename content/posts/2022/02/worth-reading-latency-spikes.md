Found a pointer to another *you cannot beat the laws of physics or networking* result: [you cannot avoid latency spikes with end-to-end congestion control](https://blog.apnic.net/2022/01/26/beyond-bufferbloat-end-to-end-congestion-control-cannot-avoid-latency-spikes/) regardless of the amount of unicorn dust or hype you're throwing at the problem ([original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00488)).
