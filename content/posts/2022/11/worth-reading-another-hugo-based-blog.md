[Bruno Wollmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wollmannbruno/) migrated his blog post to Hugo/GitHub/CloudFlare  (the exact toolchain I'm using for one of my personal web sites) and [described his choices and improved user- and author experience](https://brunowollmann.com/2022/11/this-site-now-cooked-by-hugo/).

As I keep telling you, always make sure you own your content. There's absolutely no reason to publish stuff you spent hours researching and creating on legacy platforms like WordPress, third-party walled gardens like LinkedIn, or "free services" obsessed with gathering visitors' personal data like Medium.
