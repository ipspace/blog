Geoff Huston published a lengthy article (as always)
[describing talks from recent OARC meeting](https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2022-10/oarc39.html), including resolver-less DNS and DNSSEC deployment risks.

Definitely worth reading if you're at least vaguely interested in the technology that supposedly causes all network-related outages (unless it's BGP, of course)
