Every time I mention unnumbered BGP sessions in a webinar, someone inevitably asks "_and how exactly does that work?_" I always replied "_gee, that's a blog post I should write one of these days,_" and although some readers might find it long overdue, here it is ;)

We'll work with a simple two-router lab with two parallel unnumbered links between them. Both devices will be running Cumulus VX 4.4.0 (FRR 8.4.0 container generates almost identical printouts).

Just in case you want to replicate the results, here's the [netlab topology I used](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/tree/master/BGP/Unnumbered):

netlab configures loopback IPv4 address on unnumbered Linux interfaces. While that doesn't change the results, I removed it to prove that Linux happily sends and receives IPv4 packets over an interface that does not have an IPv4 address[^IPSEC]:

[^IPSEC]: Keep that in mind the next time you'll think that removing an IPv4 address from a Linux interface makes it impossible to break in through that interface.

We know that unnumbered BGP sessions use IPv6 link-local addresses, and that FRR advertises IPv4 prefixes with IPv6 next hops using encoding specified in [RFC 5549](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5549.html) (now [RFC 8950](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8950)).

A quick look at the BGP neighbors on R1 confirms that:

* The IP address of the BGP neighbor is a link-local IPv6 address;
* The BGP session has been established between IPv6 link-local addresses;
* The routers have negotiated _extended next hop_ capabilities for IPv4 address family
* The local next hop used on outgoing updates will be the local link-local IPv6 address

BGP table (displayed by FRR) confirms FRR uses IPv6 next hops for IPv4 prefixes:

Interestingly, the IPv4 routing table in Linux kernel still uses the IPv6 next hops[^6NH]:

[^6NH]: One of many Linux Kernel contributions made by Cumulus engineers

{{<cc>}}IPv4 routing table on R1{{</cc>}}
```
r1(bash)#ip route
10.0.0.2 nhid 23 proto bgp metric 20
	nexthop via inet6 fe80::a8c1:abff:fe14:ea9e dev swp1 weight 1
	nexthop via inet6 fe80::a8c1:abff:feaf:4333 dev swp2 weight 1
```

However, keep in mind that the role of next hops in any forwarding table is to point to ARP/ND entries that contain the next-hop MAC address[^NHG] -- the thing the router has to insert into the destination MAC address of the forwarded packets.

[^NHG]: I'm ignoring [nexthop groups](https://lwn.net/Articles/763950/) in this blog post.

Here are the ND entries for the BGP next hops:

{{<cc>}}IPv4 routing table on R1{{</cc>}}
```
r1(bash)#ip neigh
169.254.0.1 dev swp1 lladdr aa:c1:ab:14:ea:9e PERMANENT proto zebra
169.254.0.1 dev swp2 lladdr aa:c1:ab:af:43:33 PERMANENT proto zebra
fe80::a8c1:abff:feaf:4333 dev swp2 lladdr aa:c1:ab:af:43:33 router REACHABLE
fe80::a8c1:abff:fe14:ea9e dev swp1 lladdr aa:c1:ab:14:ea:9e router REACHABLE
```

By now it should be evident how Linux kernel makes the packet forwarding decisions:

* IPv4 packet can be received on any interfaces, even if that interface doesn't have an IPv4 address
* Forwarding table lookup results in a next hop that could belong to a different address family
* A lookup into the neighbor table produces the MAC address of the next hop
* The next hop MAC address is used as the destination MAC address when building the outgoing MAC header.

The above explanation works well for software-based forwarding, but what happens on a Cumulus Linux switch where the packet forwarding is done in hardware, and the hardware forwarding tables are derived from Linux kernel tables? According to [_TA_](#1513), the forwarding hardware is surprisingly flexible:

{{<long-quote>}}
On Mellanox ASICs, routes will index into a host table using (next-hop IP, egress router interface) as the key, and the address-family of the next-hop does not need to match the address-family of the route. The host entry determines the DMAC that will be used after the Ethernet header is re-written post-routing.

On Broadcom ASICs, routes don't directly point to a next-hop or host table; instead they index into an "egress" table by ID. So Broadcom natively has a decoupling of a route and the L2 rewrite information returned by the LPM lookup, this allowing the control plane to choose what rules it wishes to enforce with regards to address-families of routes vs next-hops. Another fun tidbit, the ARP/NDP tables are actually collapsed into the LPM lookup as if they were host routes, and these entries also index into the same egress table.

Finally, what's the deal with the fake static ARP entries for 169.254.0.1? They were needed in the old days when Linux kernel didn't support IPv6 next hops for IPv4 routes, and they're left there in case someone disables nexthop-groups, or as [Donald Sharp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donaldsharp/) explained:

{{<long-quote>}}
The 169.254.0.1 neighbor table entries are an artifact from pre-nexthop group implementations in FRR. Prior to nexthop groups the linux kernel would not accept a v6 nexthop for a v4 prefix. So the routes were entered with a 169.254.0.1/outgoing-intf as the actual nexthop.

The code to add this entry just has not gotten removed yet, since they have not done any current harm. Additionally they are there for when the operator enters the command to turn off nexthop groups for installation into the linux kernel.
