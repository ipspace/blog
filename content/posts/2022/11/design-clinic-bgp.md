The [ipSpace.net Design Clinic](https://designclinic.ipspace.net/) has been running for a [bit over than a year](/2021/09/design-clinic.html). We covered tons of interesting technologies and design challenges, resulting in over 13 hours of content (so far), including several BGP-related discussions:

* [BGP route servers](https://designclinic.ipspace.net/topic/bgp-route-server/)
* [Redundant BGP-Based Internet Access](https://designclinic.ipspace.net/topic/redundant-internet-access/)
* [Secure BGP Configuration on Customer Routers](https://designclinic.ipspace.net/topic/securing-customer-bgp-setup/)
* [Enterprise WAN Routing Design](https://designclinic.ipspace.net/topic/enterprise-wan-routing/)

All the Design Clinic discussions are available with [Standard or Expert ipSpace.net Subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/), and anyone can [submit new design/discussion challenges](https://designclinic.ipspace.net/pages/submit/).
