Last week I completed the first part of the annual [Azure Networking](https://www.ipspace.net/Microsoft_Azure_Networking) update. The _[Azure Firewall](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=AzureNet#FIREWALL)_ section is already online; hope you'll find it useful. I already have the materials for the _Private Link_ and _Gateway Load Balancer_ services, but haven't decided whether to schedule another live session to cover them, or just create a short video.

Then there are a half-dozen smaller things I found while processing a year worth of Azure networking News. You'll find them (and links to documentation) in [New Azure Services and Features](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/AzureNet/Azure-Update.md?doccode=AzureNet) document.
