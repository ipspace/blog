<a href="http://www.nil.com/C1256F0A00429755/html/remote_labs_portfolio"><img border="0" src="/images/remote-labs.gif" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px; cursor:pointer;"/></a>In one of his recent articles, Scott Morris provided <a href="http://tcpmag.com/qanda/article.asp?EditorialsID=380#answer">an excellent summary</a> why IPv6 is still on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon">horizon</a>. The point I like most (as it's often forgotten by the techies) is this:<br/><blockquote style="FONT-STYLE: italic"><p>“After all of the pieces (network, applications, OS, etc.) are done, do you have enough people with enough knowledge to manage and design things? Now may be a good time for some training!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cisco has already included IPv6 in its mainstream BSCI course (so IPv6 is now officially part of CCNP certification). Apart from visiting the BSCI classroom course, you also have a few other options to get your hands on IPv6 training material:</p>
<ul><li>Get the <a href="http://www.nil.com/C1256F0A00429755/html/bs_portfolio">BSCI 3.0 blended solution</a> that includes student guide and access to on-line lab exercises (<a href="http://www.nil.com/C1256F0A00429755/html/remote_labs_info">real routers, no simulations </a>:).</li>
<li>If you're a Cisco partner, you can get the BSCI lab exercises from Partner E-learning Connection. To help you get past the site complex navigation, <a href="http://cisco.partnerelearning.com/peclms/lang-en/management/TAX_Search.asp?SearchStr=IPv6+BSCI&amp;AdvType=2&amp;FindBy=1&amp;Delivery+Type=1&amp;LearnPartner=500&amp;UserMode=0&amp;VSC=TAX_CiscomView_All&amp;VSO=A&amp;MPopFrom=&amp;MPopThru=#Results">click this link</a> after <a href="http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/front.x/wwtraining/PELC/main.cgi" target="_blank">logging into PEC</a>.</li>
