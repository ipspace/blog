title: The “show ip interface” command I've always wanted to have

---

Recently I was investigating MTU-related problems and got mightily upset when I had to search for the interface IP MTU size in the long printout produced by the <strong>show ip interface</strong> command. Obviously I could display the IP MTU size of a single interface with the <strong>show ip interface <em>name</em> | include MTU</strong> filter, but I wanted to have a nice tabular printout. Obviously it was time for <a href="http://www.zaplana.net/Articles/index.asp?view=tcl/ipInterfaces.tcl">another Tcl script</a>.<br/><br/>To use it, <a href="http://www.zaplana.net/Articles/index.asp?load=tcl/ipInterfaces.tcl">download it</a> and store it into the flash memory of your router. Configure <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2006/10/use-command-aliases-to-simplify-cisco.html"><strong>alias exec ipconfig tclsh flash:ipInterfaces.tcl</strong></a> and you can use <strong>ipconfig</strong> or <strong>ipconfig active</strong> to display interface IP addresses.<!--more-->Included below are sample printouts:<pre class="code">ro#<strong>ifconfig</strong><br/>Interface         IP Address      Mask            MTU  State<br/>=================================================================<br/>FastEthernet0/0   172.18.25.1     255.255.255.0   1500 up<br/>FastEthernet0/1   no address                           admin down<br/>Serial0/0/0       no address                           up<br/>Serial0/0/0.101   192.168.201.2   255.255.255.252 1500 up<br/>Serial0/1/0       no address                           up/down<br/>Serial0/1/1       no address                           down<br/>Tunnel0           FastEthernet0/0                 1476 up<br/><br/>ro#<strong>ifconfig active</strong><br/>Interface         IP Address      Mask            MTU  State<br/>=================================================================<br/>FastEthernet0/0   172.18.25.1     255.255.255.0   1500 up<br/>Serial0/0/0.101   192.168.201.2   255.255.255.252 1500 up<br/>Tunnel0           FastEthernet0/0                 1476 up</pre>
