It makes perfect sense in hindsight, but I was nonetheless pleasantly surprised: when the router acting as a DHCP client (configured with the **ip address dhcp** interface configuration command) receives the DHCP reply packet containing the default gateway option (option #3), it installs a static default route toward that next-hop.

Even better, the default route is installed with the administrative distance 254 (floating static route), making sure that the default route you've configured manually or the default route received via a routing protocol are not overwritten.

To add icing on the cake, starting with IOS release 12.3(8)T you can disable this behavior with the **no ip dhcp client request router** interface-configuration command.

The following listing contains a sample debugging session documenting this behavior:

``` code
DHCP: Received a BOOTREP pkt

DHCP: Scan: Server ID Option: 192.168.0.1 = C0A80001
