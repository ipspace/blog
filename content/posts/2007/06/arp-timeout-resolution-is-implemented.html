Under some circumstances, you might want to tune the ARP timers on the router (for example, when using ARP as a keepalive mechanism to detect whether the host is up). Unfortunately, although you can set the per-interface <strong>arp timeout</strong> in seconds, the actual timer resolution is in minutes. For example, if you set the ARP timeout to 10 seconds, the router will age the ARP entries once per minute.<!--more-->Here's a sample debugging output produced on a router running IOS release 12.4(9)T with the <strong>arp timeout 10</strong> interface configuration command. As you can see from the timestamps, the ARP entry is aged and refreshed exactly once per minute.<blockquote class="code">Jun  7 16:34:49: IP ARP: sent req src 192.168.0.1 0016.c7fe.f150, dst 192.168.0.2 000c.293a.b455 FastEthernet0/0.100<br/>Jun  7 16:34:49: IP ARP: rcvd rep src 192.168.0.2 000c.293a.b455, dst 192.168.0.1 FastEthernet0/0.100<br/>Jun  7 16:34:49: IP ARP: creating entry for IP address: 192.168.0.2, hw: 000c.293a.b455<br/>Jun  7 16:35:49: IP ARP: sent req src 192.168.0.1 0016.c7fe.f150, dst 192.168.0.2 000c.293a.b455 FastEthernet0/0.100<br/>Jun  7 16:35:49: IP ARP: rcvd rep src 192.168.0.2 000c.293a.b455, dst 192.168.0.1 FastEthernet0/0.100<br/>Jun  7 16:35:49: IP ARP: creating entry for IP address: 192.168.0.2, hw: 000c.293a.b455<br/>Jun  7 16:36:49: IP ARP: sent req src 192.168.0.1 0016.c7fe.f150, dst 192.168.0.2 000c.293a.b455 FastEthernet0/0.100<br/>Jun  7 16:36:49: IP ARP: rcvd rep src 192.168.0.2 000c.293a.b455, dst 192.168.0.1 FastEthernet0/0.100<br/>Jun  7 16:36:49: IP ARP: creating entry for IP address: 192.168.0.2, hw: 000c.293a.b455</blockquote>
