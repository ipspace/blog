They are an ideal companion to books or <a href="http://www.nil.com/C1256F620032CACB/NILLookup/BS_SNRS20?Open&amp;dm=B&amp;s=1&amp;rid=C1256F0A00429755">e-learning material</a> if you're preparing for the <a href="http://www.nil.com/C1256F0A00429755/html/CCSP">CCSP</a> exam. You can also use them as a great practice environment if you have to support security-related IOS features in your network, but simply don't have the extra equipment to test them out before deploying them.</p>
<p>As a side note, what really amazes me is the fact that Cisco has rolled out a mainstream certification course that supports pretty recent features (up to IOS release 12.4(6)T), including control-plane policing, management-plane protection, zone-based firewalls and Web VPN.</p>
