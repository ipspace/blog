If you use EEM applets with action syslog commands, the messages generated by those commands will be displayed in the same format as the debugging messages, regardless of their severity. This might be a problem if you decide to use different timestamps for debugging and regular syslog messages (or <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2006/12/remove-timestamps-from-syslog-messages.html">disable debugging timestamps completely</a>).<!--more-->For example, the following configuration ...<blockquote class="code">service timestamps debug uptime<br/>service timestamps log datetime<br/> <br/>event manager applet Serial_Down<br/> event track 1 state any<br/> action 1.0 syslog priority errors msg "IP routing on Serial 0/1/0 is $_track_state"</blockquote>
... produces these messages after an interface failure ...<blockquote class="code"><span class="high">Aug 14 11:18:32:</span> %LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface Serial0/1/0, changed state to up<br/><span class="high">1d16h:</span> %HA_EM-3-LOG: Serial_Down: IP routing on Serial 0/1/0 is up</blockquote>
