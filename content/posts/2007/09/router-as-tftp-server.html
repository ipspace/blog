Shaun needed an extra TFTP server in CCNP labs and asked whether you could use a router to act as one. The read-only (download only) TFTP functionality has been available in Cisco IOS for a long time, but the common wisdom was that you could only use the TFTP server function to serve current IOS image. <br/><br/>Fortunately, as of IOS 11.0, the function is more generic; you can serve any file residing on the router (you still cannot upload files), but you have to <a href="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios124/124cr/hcf_r/cfn_12h.htm#wp1039250">declare each file to be served with the <strong>tftp-server <em>path</em></strong></a> global configuration command. You could even specify an <strong>alias</strong> to have the file available under a different name and attach an access list to each configured file to restrict its availability.<br/><p class="note"><span>Note: </span>This article is part of <a href="/2007/01/youve-asked-for-it-series.html">You've asked for it</a> <a href="/tag/youve-asked-for-it.html">series</a>.</p>
