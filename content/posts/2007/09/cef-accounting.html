<p>The "<em>How could we figure out if any traffic uses the default route</em>" challenge was obviously too easy; a number of readers quickly realized that the CEF accounting can do what we need (and I have to admit I've completely missed it).</p>
<p>However, when I started to explore the various CEF accounting features, it turned out the whole thing is not as simple as it looks. To start with, the <strong>ip cef accounting</strong> global configuration command configures three completely unrelated accounting features: <strong>per-prefix</strong> accounting (that we need), traffic matrix accounting (configured with the <strong>non-recursive</strong> keyword) and <strong>prefix-length</strong> accounting.</p>
<p>The <strong>per-prefix</strong> accounting is the easiest one to understand: every time a packet is forwarded through a CEF lookup, the counters attached to the CEF prefix entry are increased. To clear the CEF counters, you can use the <strong>clear ip cef <em>address</em> prefix-statistics</strong> command. The per-prefix counters are also lost when the IP prefix is removed from the CEF table (for example, because it temporarily disappears from the IP routing table during network convergence process). The CEF per-prefix accounting is thus less reliable than other accounting mechanisms (for example, IP accounting).</p>
<p class="note"><span>Note:</span> The CEF per-prefix counters are always present; if the CEF per-prefix accounting is not configured, they simply remain zero.</p>
<p>Last but not least, you don't need the <strong>detail</strong> keyword if you want to display the CEF accounting data for a particular prefix. The <strong>show ip cef <em>address mask</em></strong> command is enough. And, finally, if you're running IOS release 12.2SB or 12.2XN, you can <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6566/products_feature_guide09186a008077289a.html">inspect the CEF counters with SNMP</a>.</p>
