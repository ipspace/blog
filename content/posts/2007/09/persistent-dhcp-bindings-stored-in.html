<p>If you'd like to implement persistent DHCP bindings on Cisco IOS, but cannot store them on an external server, you could always use the on-board NVRAM. Simply configure <strong>ip dhcp database nvram:dhcp.txt</strong>. Later on, you can examine the contents of the <em>dhcp.txt</em> file with <strong>more nvram:dhcp.txt</strong> command.</p>
<p class="note">This post was written in 2007, when a lot of low-end Cisco routers still shipped with flash formatted in the “old” Cisco format and the flash was not really usable to store ever-changing files. For more details on storing DHCP bindings in onboard flash, read the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2009/01/flash-based-dhcp-database.html">Flash-based DHCP Database</a> blog post.</p>
