<p>The MPLS VPN implementation on Cisco IOS has always allowed you to create VRF static routes that pointed to interfaces belonging to other VRFs. The feature can be used to implement interesting overlapping VPN (or common services VPN) designs, some of which are explained in the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22MPLS+VPN+architectures%22+site%3Aamazon.com">MPLS and VPN Architectures</a> books.</p>
<p>However, quite often the ability to create inter-VRF static routes is considered a major security problem, as an operator configuration error could establish undesired inter-VPN connectivity. In these cases, use the <strong>no ip route static inter-vrf</strong> configuration command to prevent such routes from being installed in the VRF routing table.</p>
