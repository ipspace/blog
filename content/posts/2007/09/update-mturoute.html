<a href="/">Yesterday's post</a> has generated quite a few comments (obviously a tool like this comes handy :); some of you were unable to run the .exe file I've provided, others wondered about the unexpected results. While testing the first issue, I've figured out that:<ul><li>Any C program compiled with the free Visual C++ compiler from Microsoft requires runtime library that has to be installed separately. <span style="color: #C00000;">Update: not completely true, if you use change the runtime library to the non-DLL version (Project properties/C++/Code generation tab), the exe size increases, but the external dependencies are removed.</span></li>
<li>The Visual C++ 2008 that I've used has no publicly available runtime library that you could install.</li>
</ul>
So I had to scrap my VC++ 2008 installation, download VC++ 2005, reinstall the Microsoft Platforms SDK and (after a few hours) recompiled the program:<ul><li>The new build can be <a href="http://www.zaplana.net/Articles/index.asp?binary=RouterConfigs/mturoute.zip">downloaded from the same location</a>.</li>
<li>It includes a README file that documents the changes made to the source.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">To run it, you have to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=200b2fd9-ae1a-4a14-984d-389c36f85647&amp;DisplayLang=en">install the VC++ 2005 runtime library from Microsoft</a></span></li>
</ul>
.<span style="color: #C00000;"> <strong>Update (2007-10-03)</strong>: I've rebuilt the image with static runtime library, so the VC++ runtime DLL is no longer needed. Thanks to Vladimir Kocjancic for figuring this out for me.</span><li>After these changes, the utility should be able to execute on Vista as well.</li>
Apart from the rebuild, I've fixed the <em>ICMP destination network unreachable</em> handling, which is considered identical to successful ping in the MTU measurement code (I still need to fix its handling in the trace part of the code).<br/><br/>There are also a few caveats when using this program on a Windows platform enabled for Path MTU discovery (default for the last few years):<ul><li>Whenever the Windows TCP stack receives an ICMP specifying the maximum MTU, it caches the reported MTU size (makes sense).</li>
<li>The cached MTU sizes eventually expire (but I was not able to find any documentation on the expiration time).</li>
<li>I was also not able to find any documented way of purging the path MTU cache. The command that works for me is the <strong>route -f</strong> which flushes the IP routing table.</li>
<li>Obviously, after executing <strong>route -f</strong>, the DHCP-installed default route is gone, so you have to execute <strong>ipconfig /renew</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note"><span>Note: </span>Any hints on the internal workings of path MTU cache on Windows platforms are highly appreciated</p>
