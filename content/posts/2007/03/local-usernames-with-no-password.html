There are two ways you can configure local usernames without a password:<ul><li>By using the <strong>username user</strong> command without the password option, you create a username that has a blank password (the operator has to press ENTER at the Password: prompt)</li>
<li>With the username user nopassword command, you create a user where the operator will not be prompted for the password at all.</li>
</ul>
Hopefully, you would use such usernames only with the <strong><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/03/executing-command-upon-user-login.html">autocommand</a></strong> option to give guest users a short overview of the router's operation (for example, display the interface status).<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> this article is part of <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/01/youve-asked-for-it-series.html">You've asked for it</a> <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/tag/youve-asked-for-it.html">series</a>.
