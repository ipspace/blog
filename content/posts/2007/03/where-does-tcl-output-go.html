You might have wondered what happens with output produced by Tcl procedures (for example, with the <strong>puts</strong> command) when you use Tcl in Embedded Event Manager (EEM) or Embedded Syslog Manager (ESM). If the Tcl procedure executes in context of a line (console or virtual terminal), the output is sent straight to the attached line, otherwise it's processed by the logging manager (resulting in a syslog message).<br/><br/>There are two scenarios where Tcl would execute in context of a line: if you <a href="/2007/03/running-tcl-procedures-from-command.html">start a Tcl procedure</a> with the <strong>tclsh</strong> command or if it's an EEM policy registered with the <strong>event_register_cli</strong> with <strong>sync</strong> parameter set to <strong>yes</strong>.
