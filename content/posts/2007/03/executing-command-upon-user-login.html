Cisco IOS long had the <strong>autocommand</strong> option by which you could attach any command to a username and have it execute after successful login. For example, <strong>username x autocommand show ip interface brief</strong> command would configure the router to display the interface status after someone would log in as user x.<br/><br/>After the autocommand is executed, the user is logged out and the session is disconnected, unless you configure the <strong>username <em>user</em> nohangup</strong> option, which causes the session to remain active, giving the operator another login prompt.
