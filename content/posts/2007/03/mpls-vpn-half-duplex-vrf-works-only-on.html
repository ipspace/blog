IOS release 12.3(11)T introduced <a href="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios123/123newft/123_1/ghdpvrf.htm">Half-duplex VRF</a>, a great feature for those of us who have to implement hub-and-spoke VPN (the VPN where all traffic has to pass through the central site), but hate the configuration hassle associated with it. Unfortunately, the way this feature is implemented, you can only configure it on virtual access/template interface, making it useless in most access networks. Too bad ...
