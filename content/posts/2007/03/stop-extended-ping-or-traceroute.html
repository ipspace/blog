Every introductory Cisco course tells you that you can stop any IOS command (for example, <strong>ping</strong> or <strong>traceroute</strong>) with the Ctrl/^ (also written as ^^ or Ctrl-Shift-6) escape character. What they usually forget to tell you is how to do that on non-US-ASCII keyboards or with telnet programs that do not want to recognize weird control characters.<br/><br/>The trick is simple - if you cannot generate ^^ (ASCII code 30), change the escape character. You can change it for the current session with the <strong>terminal escape-character <em>char</em></strong> exec-level command or permanently with the <strong>escape-character <em>char</em></strong> line configuration command. For example, to set the escape character for the current session to ctrl-C, use <strong>terminal escape-character 3</strong> command.<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> this article is part of <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/01/youve-asked-for-it-series.html">You've asked for it</a> <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/tag/youve-asked-for-it.html">series</a>.
