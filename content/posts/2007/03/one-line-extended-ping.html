Hard-core IOS oldtimers could probably remember the sequence of parameters in the extended IP ping dialog even when woken up in the middle of the night. However, another venerable tradition has been made obsolete in one of the IOS 12.x releases: the <strong>ping</strong> command now accepts parameters like <strong>data</strong>, <strong>repeat</strong>, <strong>size</strong>, <strong>timeout</strong> or <strong>source</strong>.<br/><br/>For example, to send 500 long pings with data pattern 0000 to 10.0.0.10, you could use the <strong>ping ip 10.0.0.10 data 0000 repeat 500 size 18000 validate</strong> command.
