Starting in IOS release 12.3(2)T, <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps5207/products_feature_guide09186a00801a75a7.html#wp1048060">Tcl shell is accessible from the command line interface </a>with the <strong>tclsh</strong> command. After entering this command, you get the <strong>Router(tcl)#</strong> prompt and can enter individual Tcl commands (the help is confusing, though - you get help on exec-mode commands, but none of them work).<br/><br/>What the documentation fails to tell you, though, is that you can specify a file name (actually an IFS URL) as the parameter to the <strong>tclsh</strong> command to execute the Tcl commands in that file. The file can be local (stored in flash or <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/02/store-your-eem-tcl-policies-in-nvram.html">even NVRAM</a>) or remote, in which case the router downloads the file and executes it.<!--more-->For example, if you store a simple helloWorld.tcl file ...<pre class="code">puts "hello world";</pre>... on an external TFTP server and execute it with the tclsh tftp://10.0.0.10/helloWorld.tcl command, you'll get the "famous" printout:<pre class="code">Router#<strong>tclsh tftp://10.0.0.10/helloWorld.tcl</strong><br/>Loading helloWorld.tcl from 10.0.0.10 (via FastEthernet0/0): !<br/>[OK - 20 bytes]<br/>hello, world</pre><p class="info">An <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Running_Tclsh_scripts_on_Cisco_IOS">revised version of this article</a> is available in the CT3 wiki.</p>
