Someone has <a href="/2007/01/youve-asked-for-it-series/">recently asked</a> an interesting question - can you disable the reload command? Although I would strongly discourage you from doing that (after all, every router I've ever worked on since a venerable MGS running IOS 10.0 had to be reloaded every now and then), here's what you can do:<ul><li>define an <a href="/2006/10/use-command-aliases-to-simplify-cisco/">alias</a> for the reload command that does something else. For example, <strong>alias exec reload show ip interface brief</strong>. While this would remind a careless operator, it would still not prevent someone using an abbreviation like <strong>relo</strong> to reload the device.</li>
<li>Use TACACS+ command accounting and disable the reload command on the TACACS+ server. The benefit of this approach is that you can do it on user-by-user basis ... but of course you need TACACS+ server, RADIUS will not do.</li>
<li>Disable the reload command with the <a href="/2006/11/cli-command-logging-without-tacacs/">Embedded Event Manager applet</a>.</li>
</ul>
<!--more-->The applet to disable the reload command would be similar to this one:<pre class="code">event manager applet NoReload<br/> event cli pattern "reload" sync no skip yes<br/> action 1.0 syslog priority errors msg "Cannot reload this router"</pre><strong>Note:</strong> this article is part of <a href="/2007/01/youve-asked-for-it-series/">You've asked for it</a> <a href="/tag/youve-asked-for-it/">series</a>.
