Did someone persuade you it's mandatory to run OSPF or IS-IS if you want to deploy MPLS TE? I've collected a few more myths like these two and <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid103_gci1276977,00.html">explained the actual facts behind them in an article</a> published by <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/">SearchTelecom</a>.</p>
