<a href="http://www.nil.com/C1256F0A00429755/html/remote_labs_portfolio"><img border="0" src="/images/remote-labs.gif" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px; cursor:pointer;"/></a>I've written a lot about MPLS Traffic Engineering (not nearly as much as I would like, but there are always time constraints), as I believe this technology has interesting applications in Enterprise networks (and we all know that a lot of Service Providers are using it anyway). You might have seen my <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid103_gci1276977,00.html">10 MPLS Traffic Engineering Myths</a> or the <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/LoadSharingTE/">Perfect Load Balancing</a> article … and if you don't know what I'm talking about, there's always the introductory <a href="http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/generic/0,295582,sid103_gci1277052,00.html">Traffic Engineering the Service Provider Network</a>.<br/><br/>The major problem of MPLS TE is that it's complex and that networking engineers usually lack the hands-on skills, and this is where we can help you: we've just rolled out the <a href="http://www.nil.com/ls/LB_RL_MPLSTE20">revised MPLS TE lab exercises</a>. Compared to remote lab offerings from other sources, these lab exercises are very focused: you get step-by-step instructions (but no recipes, that would spoil the learning process), preconfigured equipment (so you don't have to configure IP addresses or IP routing protocols to get the job done) and detailed solutions explaining which task is achieved using a specific set of configuration commands.<br/><br/>I was able to get a discount for my readers: if you <a href="http://www.nil.com/catalog/mplste1w">click this link</a> and type in the promotion code <strong>42B078</strong> (expires on January 15th, 2008), you'll get a one week subscription to the MPLS TE remote lab bundle for €56. As this is a subscription offering, you can run the lab exercises as often as you like within a week of the purchasing date. And if you need one more argument to be persuaded, <a href="http://www.nil.com/ls/LE_MPLSTE20_Basic">check the lab topology</a>; you can experiment in a preconfigured nine router network :)
