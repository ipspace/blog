<a href="http://6200networks.com/?page_id=2">Joe Harris</a> published an <a href="http://6200networks.com/?p=57">excellent post detailing how you can use Flexible Packet Matching to recognize (and potentially block) Skype traffic</a>. The solution depends on recognizing the first four bytes sent by the Skype application in a TCP session. While this is a great idea, you have to be aware that there's always a <a href="/2007/10/war-story-almost-zero-is-not-good/">non-zero chance of false positives</a>, more so as the described filter is testing the beginning of the payload in every TCP packet (not just the first data packet in the session).
