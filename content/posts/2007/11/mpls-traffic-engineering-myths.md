Did you believe MPLS TE was a quality-of-service feature? Did someone persuade you it's mandatory to run OSPF or IS-IS if you want to deploy MPLS TE? I've collected a few more myths like these two and [explained the actual facts behind them in an article](http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid103_gci1276977,00.html) published by [SearchTelecom](http://searchtelecom.techtarget.com/).
