After I've fixed the default routing in my home office, I've stumbled across another problem: the two ISPs I'm using for my primary and backup link have DNS servers that reply solely to the DNS requests sent from their own IP address range:<br/><br/><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_K_pkZO5-tTg/RzwzvCb6JbI/AAAAAAAAAuM/iyBVsjHo4sE/s1600-h/homeSetupDNS.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5133034558496318898" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_K_pkZO5-tTg/RzwzvCb6JbI/AAAAAAAAAuM/iyBVsjHo4sE/s400/homeSetupDNS.jpg" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;"/></a>When the traffic is switched from the primary to the backup ISP, I therefore also need to switch the DNS servers. Fortunately, this is quite easy to do on a router; you just need to configure <strong>ppp ipcp dns request</strong> on the dialer interface and the router starts asking for the DNS server address as part of the IPCP negotiation.<!--more--><br/>The negotiation process can be debugged with the <strong>debug ppp negotiation</strong> command; it's a bit more complex than usual in my case since the access server has no secondary DNS (only the primary DNS is configured):<pre class="code">Se1/0 IPCP: O CONFREQ [Closed] id 1 len 22<br/>Se1/0 IPCP:    Address 0.0.0.0 (0x030600000000)<br/><span class="high">Se1/0 IPCP:    PrimaryDNS 0.0.0.0 (0x810600000000)<br/>Se1/0 IPCP:    SecondaryDNS 0.0.0.0 (0x830600000000)</span><br/>Se1/0 PPP: Process pending ncp packets<br/>Se1/0 IPCP: Redirect packet to Se1/0<br/>Se1/0 IPCP: I CONFREQ [REQsent] id 1 len 10<br/>Se1/0 IPCP:    Address 10.0.0.33 (0x03060A000021)<br/>Se1/0 IPCP: O CONFACK [REQsent] id 1 len 10<br/>Se1/0 IPCP:    Address 10.0.0.33 (0x03060A000021)<br/>Se1/0 IPCP: I CONFREJ [ACKsent] id 1 len 10<br/>Se1/0 IPCP:    SecondaryDNS 0.0.0.0 (0x830600000000)<br/>Se1/0 IPCP: O CONFREQ [ACKsent] id 2 len 16<br/>Se1/0 IPCP:    Address 0.0.0.0 (0x030600000000)<br/>Se1/0 IPCP:    PrimaryDNS 0.0.0.0 (0x810600000000)<br/>Se1/0 IPCP: I CONFNAK [ACKsent] id 2 len 16<br/>Se1/0 IPCP:    Address 10.0.0.34 (0x03060A000022)<br/>Se1/0 IPCP:    PrimaryDNS 10.0.0.10 (0x81060A00000A)<br/>Se1/0 IPCP: O CONFREQ [ACKsent] id 3 len 16<br/>Se1/0 IPCP:    Address 10.0.0.34 (0x03060A000022)<br/>Se1/0 IPCP:    PrimaryDNS 10.0.0.10 (0x81060A00000A)<br/><span class="high">Se1/0 IPCP: I CONFACK [ACKsent] id 3 len 16<br/>Se1/0 IPCP:    Address 10.0.0.34 (0x03060A000022)<br/>Se1/0 IPCP:    PrimaryDNS 10.0.0.10 (0x81060A00000A)</span><br/>Se1/0 IPCP: State is Open</pre>The results can be inspected only with the show host command:<pre class="code">GW#<strong>show host</strong><br/>Default domain is not set<br/>Name/address lookup uses domain service<br/><span class="high">Name servers are 10.0.0.10</span></pre>The access server receiving the call requires no special configuration; the first IP address configured with the <strong>ip name-server</strong> command is used as the primary DNS and the second one as the secondary. Alternatively, you can configure a different set of DNS servers to pass to the client with the <strong>ppp ipcp dns <em>primary-DNS-address secondary-DNS-address</em></strong> interface configuration command.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the integration with LAN clients is not <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/08/import-dhcp-options-from-upstream-dhcp.html">as seamless as with DHCP</a>; to make the whole solution work, you have to configure the router as a forwarding DNS server and make the LAN clients use the router as the default gateway and DNS server with the DHCP pool configuration:<pre class="code">ip dns server<br/>!<br/>ip dhcp pool LAN<br/>   import all<br/>   network 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.240<br/>   default-router 192.168.0.1<br/>   dns-server 192.168.0.1</pre>
