<p>If you're new to Tcl and would like to start using it on Cisco IOS, here's what worked for me:</p>
<ul><li>I've downloaded the <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/activetcl/">ActiveTcl from ActiveState</a>. It's always good to have development environment on your workstation.</li>
<li>The documentation that comes with ActiveTcl is quite cryptic, but once you know what you're looking for, it's OK.</li>
<li>To get to the "I know what I'm looking for" stage, I've used <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tcl-Second-Developers-Engineering-Programming/dp/1558608028">Tcl/Tk: A Developer's Guide</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you know better beginner books/sources, let us all know.</p>
