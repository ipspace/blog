Thinking about the implications of <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/11/back-to-roots-it-all-started-with-sdlc.html">bit stuffing I wrote about in the SDLC post</a>, I realized that long sequences of ones would be transmitted slower than long sequences of zeroes due to an extra bit being inserted after every fifth consecutive one. The theory would predict a 20% decrease in transmission speed. <br/><br/>Of course I wanted to test this phenomenon immediately. I needed real equipment with low-speed serial links (that would make the difference more pronounced and less dependent on other intra-router delays), so I started one of the <a href="www.nil.com/ls/LB_RL_BGP">BGP lab exercises</a>; <a href="http://www.nil.com/C1256F620032CACB/NILLookup/LE_BGP_Basic?OpenDocument">Basic BGP Setup</a> looked like a perfect choice. We're using 64 kbps Frame Relay links in the lab with a Frame Relay switch in the middle (makes the task of designing an arbitrary WAN topology quite simple), so it's a perfect environment to test this thing. And, not surprisingly, the results confirmed the theory:<blockquote class="code">Internal-Core#<strong>ping 197.1.1.49 <span class="high">data 0000</span> size 1200 repeat 50</strong><br/>Sending 50, 1200-byte ICMP Echos to 197.1.1.49, timeout is 2 seconds:<br/>Packet has data pattern 0x0000<br/>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>Success rate is 100 percent (50/50), round-trip min/avg/max = <span class="high">608/608/632 ms</span><br/> <br/>Internal-Core#<strong>ping 197.1.1.49 <span class="high">data FFFF</span> size 1200 repeat 50</strong><br/>Sending 50, 1200-byte ICMP Echos to 197.1.1.49, timeout is 2 seconds:<br/>Packet has data pattern 0xFFFF<br/>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>Success rate is 100 percent (50/50), round-trip min/avg/max = <span class="high">724/724/728 ms</span></blockquote>
<p class="note">The results are almost too close to the predicted ones,  but they are real :)</p>
