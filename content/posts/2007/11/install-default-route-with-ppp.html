<p>In my home office, I'm using DSL access to the Internet with ISDN backup to another ISP, as shown on the next figure:</p>
<div class='separator'><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_K_pkZO5-tTg/Rzwjmib6JaI/AAAAAAAAAuE/G0pcScF3Cy8/s1600-h/homeSetup.jpg"><img src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_K_pkZO5-tTg/Rzwjmib6JaI/AAAAAAAAAuE/G0pcScF3Cy8/s400/homeSetup.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5133016820281386402" /></a></div>
<p>Obviously, I would like the ISDN backup to kick in whenever the primary connection goes down; two static default routes and <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/02/reliable-static-routing.html">reliable static routing on the primary default</a> seem like a perfect solution.<!--more--></p>
<p>However, as I'm using PPP encapsulation on the primary connection, there's another option: PPP can <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps5207/products_feature_guide09186a00802d41b3.html">insert a dynamic default route</a> whenever IPCP negotiations succeed (and remove it when the line protocol goes down). To configure this feature (introduced in IOS releases 12.3(11)T and 12.4), use the <strong>ppp ipcp route default</strong> interface configuration command on the primary dialer interface.</p>
