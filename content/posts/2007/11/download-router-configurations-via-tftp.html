In a previous post, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/09/router-as-tftp-server.html">I've described how you can turn your router into a TFTP server</a>. As you can configure the router to serve any file residing on it, you can also pull startup and running configuration from it with TFTP, providing that you configure:<pre class="code">tftp-server nvram:startup-config<br/>tftp-server system:running-config</pre><p class="note"><span>Warning: </span>Due to total lack of any security features in TFTP protocol, use this functionality only in lab environment.</p>
