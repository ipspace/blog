I will not even try to guess whether there is a wide consensus on how to configure a router, but these are the facts (and here is <a href="http://seclists.org/bugtraq/1997/Nov/0078.html">a ten year old position from Cisco</a>):<ul><li>Type-7 encryption used in <strong>enable password</strong> has been broken. <a href="ftp://puck.nether.net/pub/jared/decrypt.c">Source code for the decrypt program</a> and <a href="http://www.kazmier.com/computer/cisco-cracker.html">cracker programs are available online</a>, or you could <a href="/2007/11/type-7-decryption-in-cisco-ios.html">use a router to do it for you</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://seclists.org/bugtraq/1997/Nov/0078.html">type-7 encryption is reversible</a> (and easily breakable due to a weak algorithm), whereas type-5 encryption is a one-way encryption that probably requires a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack">dictionary attack</a> to break.</li>
<li>Based on the previous two facts, you should never use <strong>enable password</strong>. Use <strong>enable secret</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>service password-encryption</strong> encodes passwords attached to local usernames with type-7 encryption. The usage of type-7 encryption is necessary as you might need the cleartext passwords in some authentication mechanisms (for example, CHAP). However, it's still better to have scrambled passwords than cleartext ones; at least a casual observer will not be able to read them. Conclusion: use <strong>service password-encryption</strong>.</li>
<li>If your authentication methods don't need cleartext passwords (examples: local <a href="/2006/12/local-username-authentication.html">username/password authentication</a>, <a href="/2007/03/configure-local-authentication-with-aaa.html">local AAA authentication</a> or <a href="/2007/11/emulate-dialup-links-with-serial-lines.html">PAP authentication</a>), use <a href="/2007/03/enhanced-password-security-for-local.html"><strong>username secret</strong></a> configuration command (available from IOS releases 12.2T, 12.3 and 12.0S).</li>
