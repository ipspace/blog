If you have an existing BOOTP environment (for example, a set of old Unix workstations and X-terminals) and want to deploy DHCP on the same LAN segment, you could run into interesting compatibility issues, as the DHCP servers by default responds to BOOTP requests.<br/><br/>However, IOS has an interesting feature when you use a router as a DHCP server: you can tell it to ignore the BOOTP requests with the <strong>ip dhcp bootp ignore </strong>global configuration command (introduced in 12.2T and 12.3). Even more, the router can respond to DHCP requests and forward BOOTP requests to a non-local BOOTP server configured with the <strong>ip helper-address</strong> interface configuration command.
