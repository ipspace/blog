The <a href="/2007/06/ip-interface-command-i-always-wanted-to.html#comment-3617099911290021687">comment to one of my previous posts</a> reminded me of a cool feature that's been available in Cisco IOS for a number of years - you can change how the IP addresses and routes are displayed in various <strong>show</strong> printouts (but not in the router configuration) with the <strong>terminal ip netmask-format bit-count|decimal</strong> exec-level command. You can even make the change permanent by configuring <strong>ip netmask-format <em>format</em></strong> on console and VTY lines.<p class="note">And the funniest part of the whole story is that I was utterly impressed with the feature when it was introduced ... and now almost started to reinvent the wheel and implement the same functionality in Tcl</p>
