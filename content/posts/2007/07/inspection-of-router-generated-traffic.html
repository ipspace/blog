After I've published a post on <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/06/inspect-router-generated-traffic.html">how you can use the new <strong>router-traffic</strong> keyword to minimize the Internet-facing access list you use with CBAC</a>, Euphrates Greene pointed out to me that this feature does not work for client DHCP traffic (if the router is acting as a DHCP client, for example, when connected to a MAN Ethernet environment).<br/><br/>Once you start thinking about what's really going on, it all becomes obvious: as the router has no IP address when it sends the DHCP request, and it sends the DHCP request to a broadcast address (as it doesn't know the IP address of the upstream DHCP server), there is no session that could be entered into the CBAC session table. So you still have to allow all DHCP traffic to your router with an access-list similar to this one:<pre class="code">ip access-list extended Internet<br/> permit udp <span class="high">any</span> eq bootps any eq bootpc<br/> deny ip any any</pre><p class="note"><span>Note: </span>Replace the highlighted any keyword with the actual DHCP server's IP adress if you have it available and you want to have an even more secure IP access-list.</p>
