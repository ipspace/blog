<p>Following my post <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/06/using-mpls-vpn-books-to-study-for-ccip.html">about the relationship between the <em>MPLS and VPN architectures</em> books and CCIP MPLS exam</a>, Peter Dob had an excellent idea: combine the MPLS and VPN architectures (Volume I, CCIP edition would be even better) with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/MPLS-Fundamentals-Luc-Ghein/dp/1587051974">MPLS fundamentals from Luc de Ghein</a>. By reading Luc's book, you'll also get exposure to other MPLS-related topics (for example, AToM) on top of MPLS TE overview that you need for the exam.</p>
