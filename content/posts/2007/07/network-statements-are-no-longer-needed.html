If you've ever had to configure OSPF on a Cisco router, you're well familiar with the venerable <strong>network</strong> statement, which effectively assigns interfaces into OSPF areas based on their IP addresses. Although our life became simpler when the <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2006/11/network-statements-in-ospf-process-are.html">network statements stopped being order-dependent</a> (the order dependency allowed for a few nasty surprises in the troubleshooting part of the CCIE lab ... when the CCIE title still implied you had to be able to fix other people's mistakes :), it was still an awkward way of configuring what belongs where.<br /><br />In IOS release 12.3(11)T (integrated in 12.4), Cisco finally implemented OSPF the way it should have been implemented 20 years ago - you configure the OSPF area on individual interfaces with the <strong>ip ospf <em>process</em> area <em>area-id</em></strong> interface configuration command.<br /><br />The network statements still work as expected and the per-interface command overrides whatever the network statement would do, so you have an extremely nice combination that allows you to assign all interfaces into a particular area (for example, <strong>network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 2</strong>) and change the area for only a few interfaces (for example, uplinks into the backbone area).
