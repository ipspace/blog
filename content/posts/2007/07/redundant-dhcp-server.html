If you want to build a truly redundant LAN infrastructure, you should also have redundant DHCP servers. If you decide to do the DHCP address allocation locally (on the router), you should take care that the two routers acting as DHCP servers don't assign overlapping addresses.<br/><br/>If the address space assigned to a LAN is at least twice as large as the number of LAN-attached devices, you can use the ip dhcp excluded-addresses command to exclude half of the address pool on each router, for example:<pre class="code">ip dhcp pool LAN<br/> network <span style="color: #F00; text-decoration: line-through">192.168.1.0</span> 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0<br/>!<br/>! Exclude router addresses<br/>ip dhcp excluded-addresses 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.10<br/>!<br/>! Exclude half of the pool<br/>ip dhcp excluded-addresses 192.168.0.128 192.168.0.255</pre>Alternatively, you can rely on the <strong>ip dhcp ping packets</strong> command; the router will ping an IP address to check whether it's live before assigning it (by default, the router sends two pings with 500 millisecond timeout).<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> You can also inspect the conflicting IP addresses the router found with the show ip dhcp conflict command.
