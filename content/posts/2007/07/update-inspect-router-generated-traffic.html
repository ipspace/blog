In my previous post, I've described how you can get a very clean configuration with no holes in your Internet-facing access-list if you have <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/06/inspect-router-generated-traffic.html">IOS release that supports inspection of router-generated traffic</a>. As it turns out, my solution was not complete - you could not <em>ping</em> from the router. On top of inspecting UDP and TCP traffic (as is usually done), you also have to inspect ICMP traffic that the router uses for pings. <br/><br/>Furthermore, if you use any protocols that have separate control and data sessions (for example, FTP, H.323 or SIP), you have to list them <em>before</em> <strong>tcp</strong> or <strong>udp</strong> keywords, otherwise their control streams will not be inspected and there will be no provision for data sessions.<pre class="code">ip inspect name Internet ftp<br/>ip inspect name Internet h.323 router-traffic<br/>ip inspect name Internet sip router-traffic<br/>ip inspect name Internet tcp router-traffic<br/>ip inspect name Internet udp router-traffic<br/>ip inspect name Internet icmp router-traffic<br/>!<br/>interface FastEthernet0/0<br/> ip access-group Internet in<br/> ip inspect Internet out<br/>!<br/>ip access-list extended Internet<br/> deny ip any any</pre>
