I should probably write this one on April 1st, but maybe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween">October 31st</a> is not such a bad choice after all â€¦ if you configure <strong>no service prompt config</strong>, the configuration prompt is gone; when you enter the configuration mode with the <strong>configure terminal</strong> command, you get an empty line (like you did with Cisco software release 9.1 some 15 years ago). Similarly, you can disable command-line editing with the <strong>no editing</strong> line configuration command or <strong>terminal no editing</strong> exec-level command. If only there would be a way to disable the context-sensitive help :)
