When developing yet another Tcl script, I've stumbed across an interesting show command: the <strong>show ip access-list interface <em>name</em></strong> <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6441/products_configuration_guide_chapter09186a0080716ec0.html">introduced in IOS release 12.4(6)T</a> displays the contents of the inbound and outbound IP access-list applied to the specified interface. The really nice part is that the ACL statistics (number of matches displayed next to the ACL lines) are kept and displayed per-interface.<!--more-->For example, this is the printout from one of my test routers:<pre class="code">R2#<strong>show ip access-list 101</strong><br/>Extended IP access list 101<br/>    10 permit ip any any (<span class="high">1900 matches</span>)<br/>R2#<strong>show ip access-list interface tunnel 0</strong><br/>Extended IP access list ICMP in<br/>    10 deny icmp any host 10.0.1.2 echo<br/>    20 deny icmp any host 10.2.0.2 echo<br/>    30 permit ip any any (2279 matches)<br/>Extended IP access list 101 out<br/>    10 permit ip any any (<span class="high">10 matches</span>)</pre>
