We've just rolled out a <a href="http://www.nil.com/ls/BS_ICND1_10">blended e-learning version</a> of the requisite <a href="http://www.nil.com/ls/ICND1">ICND1</a> (yes, that is ICND part one) course containing <a href="http://www.nil.com/C1256F0A00429755/html/bs_info">student guides in e-learning format</a> and <a href="http://www.nil.com/ls/LB_RL_ICND1_10">all the associated remote lab exercises</a> (<a href="http://www.nil.com/C1256F0A00429755/html/remote_labs_info">performed on actual devices</a>, no simulations).
