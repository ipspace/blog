Luckily I've double-checked before starting to write a Tcl script and realized that a <strong>brief</strong> keyword was added in IOS release 12.3, producing exactly the printout I was looking for.<!--more-->On my test router, the show ip ospf interfaces brief command produced this nicely-tabulated printout:<pre class="code">a1#<strong>show ip ospf interface brief</strong><br/>Interface    PID   Area  IP Address/Mask    Cost  State Nbrs F/C<br/>Lo0          1     0     172.16.0.11/32     1     LOOP  0/0<br/>Se0/0/0.100  1     0     172.16.1.1/30      50    P2P   1/1<br/>Fa0/0        1     0     10.0.0.5/24        1     BDR   1/1<br/>Fa0/1        1     11    10.1.2.1/24        1     DR    0/0</pre><p class="note">The <strong><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/07/changing-format-of-ip-routes.html">netmask-format</a></strong> of your line has to be set to <strong>bit-count</strong> for this command to work properly, otherwise the columns will be shifted to the right.</p>
