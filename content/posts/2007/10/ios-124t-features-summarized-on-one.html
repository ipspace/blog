I always thought that the new format of the Cisco web-based documentation was awful, as it consumes way more bandwidth than the old version and is slower to load over low-speed links as it displays the text only after the complete page is loaded due to heavy use of table-based HTML layout (I will refrain from commenting the use of this layout technique in the third millenium). However, the new content structure has some significant benefits; for example, <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6441/products_feature_guides_list.html">all the 12.4T feature guides are collected on a single page</a> â€¦ fantastic if you try  to find a feature that you remember was implemented somewhere in 12.4T track.
