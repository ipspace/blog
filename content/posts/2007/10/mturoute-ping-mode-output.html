Jeff West has asked me to document the printout produced by the <a href="/search?q=mturoute"><em>mturoute</em> utility</a>. Here's the first part of the documentation.<br/><br/><em>mturoute</em> works in two modes:<ul><li>Without the -t flag, it sends variable-lenght ICMP echo packets to the specified destination address, trying to figure out the largest packet that is successfully propagated to the destination.</li>
<li>With the -t flag, it uses traceroute-like algorithm to find the hop-by-hop IP addresses (the source IP addresses of the ICMP TTL exceeded replies) and uses the same packet-size-calculating algorithm to measure the path MTU to each hop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today we'll focus on the non-trace mode. It tries to measure the path MTU with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method">bisection method</a> varying the packet sizes between minimum MTU (92) and maximum MTU (specified with the -m parameter, default is 10000 bytes). The payload size of the first packet (without the -m flag) is thus 5046 bytes ((10000 + 92)/2).<br/><br/>On each iteration, the algorithm prints a “cryptic” sign indicating whether the ping with the current payload size succeeded. The following indications are given:<ul><li>'+': ICMP echo reply arrived</li>
<li>'-': The ping failed (for various reasons, including exceeding the path MTU)</li>
<li>'u': ICMP destination unreachable response arrived, indicating blackhole or access-list.</li>
<p class="note">ICMP unreachable is considered a successful response; at least we're measuring the path MTU up to the failure point</p>
<li>'.': timeout. The ping will be retried up to three times (or the number specified with the -r option).</li>
</ul>
In the ping mode, <em>mturoute</em> prints the current ICMP payload size at each step, resulting in a printout similar to the one below. If you'd have specified the -d option, the printout would include detailed status codes from the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366050.aspx">IcmpSendEcho function</a>.<pre class="code">$ <strong>mturoute 10.0.3.3</strong><br/>* ICMP Fragmentation is not permitted. *<br/>* Maximum payload is 10000 bytes. *<br/>- ICMP payload of 5046 bytes failed..<br/>- ICMP payload of 2569 bytes failed..<br/>+ ICMP payload of 1330 bytes succeeded.<br/>- ICMP payload of 1949 bytes failed..<br/>- ICMP payload of 1639 bytes failed..<br/>- ICMP payload of 1484 bytes failed..<br/>+ ICMP payload of 1407 bytes succeeded.<br/>- ICMP payload of 1445 bytes failed..<br/>+ ICMP payload of 1426 bytes succeeded.<br/>+ ICMP payload of 1435 bytes succeeded.<br/>+ ICMP payload of 1440 bytes succeeded.<br/>+ ICMP payload of 1442 bytes succeeded.<br/>+ ICMP payload of 1443 bytes succeeded.<br/>+ ICMP payload of 1444 bytes succeeded.<br/>+ ICMP payload of 1444 bytes succeeded.<br/>Path MTU: 1472 bytes.</pre><p class="note"><span>Note: </span>To use the debug-enabled version of mturoute, or the version that does not need VC++ runtime, <a href="http://www.zaplana.net/Articles/index.asp?binary=RouterConfigs/mturoute.zip">download the new ZIP archive</a> from my web site.</p>
