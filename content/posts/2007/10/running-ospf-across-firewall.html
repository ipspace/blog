When I was reading <a href="http://6200networks.com/?page_id=2">Joe Harris</a>' post detailing how you can <a href="http://6200networks.com/?p=23">run OSPF across a PIX/ASA firewall</a> (not with it, but between the adjacent routers), I wondered why anyone would want to do it. Our security gurus immediately gave me an answer: suppose you have two separate DMZs similar to the following setup:<br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_K_pkZO5-tTg/Rw80Id_sCCI/AAAAAAAAAjo/x43Ul4EmT4w/s1600-h/DoubleDMZ.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_K_pkZO5-tTg/Rw80Id_sCCI/AAAAAAAAAjo/x43Ul4EmT4w/s400/DoubleDMZ.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5120368621438896162" /></a><br />You definitely don't want to attract traffic to a DMZ if the Internet uplink is down. One of the ways to handle it is to <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/06/ospf-default-route-design-scenarios.html">conditionally source the OSPF default route</a> on the outside routers (<a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/08/conditional-ospf-default-route-tested.html">based on availability of BGP prefixes</a>, for example) and pass it to the inside routers that propagate it to the rest of the network.<br /><br />The question that remains to be answered is &ldquo;why wouldn't you run OSPF with the firewall?&rdquo; If nothing else, if someone breaks into the outside router, he could manipulate the IP routing on the firewall, which is definitely not a good idea (you can't filter routing updates in OSPF like you can in RIP, EIGRP or BGP).
