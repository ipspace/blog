The flash memory available in newer router platforms (at the very minimum the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/routers/networking_solutions_products_generic_content0900aecd806cab99.html">ISR routers</a> and 37xx series) is capable of being used as a regular disk drive (for example, to <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/09/logging-to-flash-disk.html">store system logging</a> information), but it might be formatted as a traditional Low-End File System (LEFS) flash card (more likely if the router was not manufactured recently). To change the flash card format to disk-like FAT32 format, use the <strong>format flash:</strong> privileged-level command (and don't forget to store the IOS image to another location before formatting the flash). After the format process is complete, you can create subdirectories on the flash: memory and use it as a regular disk device.<!--more-->A sample formatting operation is displayed below:<blockquote class="code">fw#<strong>format flash:</strong><br/>Format operation may take a while.
