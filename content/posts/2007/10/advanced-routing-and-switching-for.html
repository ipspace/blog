Apart from heavy focus on MPLS VPN (that was largely missing from the CCNP curriculum), it includes advanced network management and high availability topics.<br/><br/>If you're not an expert working for a Cisco partner, you'll probably not want to attend the full-blown instructor-led course, but you can still get the same hands-on experience using our newly released <a href="http://www.nil.com/C1256F620032CACB/NILLookup/LB_RL_ARSFE20?Open&amp;dm=R&amp;s=1&amp;rid=C1256F0A00429755">ARSFE remote lab exercises</a>.</p>
