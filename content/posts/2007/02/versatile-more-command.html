With IOS file system (IFS) introduced in IOS release 11.3AA (integrated in 12.0), IOS got the <strong>more</strong> command that displays any local or remote file that you could specify with IFS. The obvious use of the <strong>more</strong> command would be display of startup configuration (<strong>more nvram:startup-config</strong>), but you could also display built-in Tcl EEM policies (for example, <strong>more system:lib/tcl/http.tcl</strong>) or remote router configurations (for example, <strong>more tftp://host/cfg-file</strong>). But that's not all, you could even troubleshoot web servers and display HTML generated by the web server (for example, <strong>more http://192.168.0.2/index.html</strong>).<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> IOS documentation claims that the <strong>show running</strong> command is obsolete and that you should use <strong>more system:running-config</strong>. This is not true, as the <strong>show running</strong> command has a number of interesting options that are not implemented with the <strong>more</strong> command.
