Recently I had to investigate <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/01/default-username-on-cisco-routers.html#comment-6432165885250429432">whether Cisco Router and Security Device Manager (SDM) uses a default username/password</a>, so I was forced to figure out how exactly the SDM works. The minimum functionality needed on an SDM-enabled router is preconfigured Ethernet interface, HTTP server and (optionally) DHCP pool.<!--more-->Just in case you need to reset a router configuration into a state where you can reinitialize it with SDM, here's the minimum configuration to make it work:<pre class="code">! Use whatever your first Ethernet interface is here<br/>!<br/>interface FastEthernet0/0<br/> ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.248<br/> duplex auto<br/><br/>ip http server<br/>no ip http secure-server<br/><br/>ip dhcp pool SDM<br/>   network 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.248</pre><b>Note:</b> routers shipped from Cisco would usually include <strong>username cisco password cisco</strong> configuration command.
