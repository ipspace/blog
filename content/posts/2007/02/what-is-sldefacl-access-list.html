title: What is the sl_def_acl access list
url: /2007/02/what-is-sldefacl-access-list.html

<p>Recenty, a lot of people were looking for information on the sl_def_acl access list. Here's the whole story: if you've configured <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2006/12/cisco-ios-login-enhancements.html">IOS login enhancements</a> on your router, the router generates an access list named <em>sl_def_acl</em> (unless you specify your own with the <strong>login quiet-mode access-class</strong> command) the first time it has to enter the <em>quiet mode</em>. This access-list is then applied to the VTY lines whenever the router enters the <em>quiet mode</em> and removed from the after the quiet period is over. The access list itself is left in the running configuration.<!--more--></p>
<p>For those of you interested in the details, the <em>sl_def_acl</em> access list contains these lines in IOS release 12.4(9)T:</p>
<pre class="code">router#<strong>show access-list</strong><br/>Extended IP access list sl_def_acl<br/>    10 deny tcp any any eq telnet log<br/>    20 deny tcp any any eq www log<br/>    30 deny tcp any any eq 22 log<br/>    40 permit tcp any any eq 22 log</pre><p>The last line makes me wonder if the programmers of this particular feature should attend the ICND course first :).</p>
