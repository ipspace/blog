title: Not All Static Routes Were Created Equal

<p>In his <a href="/2007/02/unequal-load-split-with-static-routes/#c7415263930194907319">excellent question</a>, Matt reminded me of (almost prehistoric) days when static routes pointing to a connected interface (not IP next-hop) had administrative distance zero. I also remembered that we've had interesting routing problems as those static routes actually behaved like connected routes (and were redistributed into routing protocols with <strong>redistribute connected</strong> command).<!--more--></p>
<p>This is no longer the case (and hasn't been since at least IOS release 12.2 ... I wasn't able to find a box running an older release to test it), all static routes now have default administrative distance one, and behave like they should (they never get redistributed with <strong>redistribute connected</strong> command).</p>
<p>For example, with the router configuration ...</p>
<pre class="code">ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 serial 0/0.1<br/>ip route 1.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 172.16.0.4</pre><p>... both routes have identical administrative distance:</p>
<pre class="code">POP#<strong>show ip route 0.0.0.0</strong>Routing entry for 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0, supernet<br/> Known via "static", <span class="high">&gt;distance 1, metric 0 (connected)</span>, candidate default path<br/> Routing Descriptor Blocks:<br/> * directly connected, via Serial0/0.1<br/>   Route metric is 0, traffic share count is 1<br/>POP#show ip route 1.0.0.0<br/>Routing entry for 1.0.0.0 255.0.0.0<br/> Known via "static", <span class="high">distance 1, metric 0</span><br/> Routing Descriptor Blocks:<br/> * 172.16.0.4<br/>   Route metric is 0, traffic share count is 1</pre><p class="note">Searching through Cisco's Bug toolkit turned up only a single relevant bug: CSCdi38232 (redistribute connected should not redistribute static route to OSPF), which was fixed in IOS release 10.2 and 10.3, that's probably also when they've fixed the administrative distance.</p>
