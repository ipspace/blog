I've tried to be a "good citizen" in one of my Embedded Eveng Manager (EEM) applications and used the <strong>action 1.1 cli command "copy running-config startup-config"</strong> instead of the (supposedly obsolete) <strong>action 1.1 cli command "<span class="high">write memory</span>"</strong> command. However, as the copy command generates console prompts (unless you turn them off with the <a href="/2006/11/reduce-noise-generated-by-cisco-ios.html"><strong>file prompt quiet</strong></a> command), it immediately hung my EEM applet.<br/><br/>Moral of the story: use <strong>write memory</strong> :)
