The IOS command line interface has long included unix-style pipes that you could use to limit the output generated by the show commmands. Initially, the only available filters were <strong>begin</strong> (include everything after the first regular expression match), <strong>end</strong> (stop the output at the RE match) or <strong>include</strong> (include only matching lines).<br/><br/>IOS release 12.3(2)T (integrated in 12.4) brought us a few new filters, among them the <strong>section</strong> filter that includes or excludes whole sections (start of section being defined by a line with no leading space). You can use this filter to focus on parts of your router configuration. For example, to display only the routing protocols configuration, use <strong>show running | section include router</strong> command.<br/><br/>Of course, you can go a step further and define an alias, for example <strong>alias exec events show running | include ^event manager</strong> configuration command defines the exec-mode <strong>events</strong> command that lists all EEM applets.
