title: Unequal Cost Load-Sharing with MPLS TE
url: /2007/02/unequal-cost-load-sharing.html
---
One of the most commonly asked load-sharing-related questions is "*can I load-share traffic across unequal-cost links?*". In general, the answer is no. In order to load-share the traffic, you need more than one path to the destination and the only way to get multiple routes toward a destination in the IP routing table is to make them equal-cost (the only notable exception being EIGRP that supports unequal-cost load-sharing with the **variance** parameter).

There are, however, two cases where you can force unequal traffic split across equal-cost paths toward a destination: when using [inter-AS BGP with the link bandwidth parameter](/2008/07/unequal-bandwidth-ebgp-load-balancing.html), and when using unequal-bandwidth traffic-engineering tunnels.

Due to the way MPLS TE autoroute is implemented in Cisco IOS, all tunnels toward the same destination appear as equal-cost paths, even when their TE bandwidths are not the same. For example, using a simple TE configuration...

``` {.code}
interface Tunnel0
 ip unnumbered Loopback0
 tunnel destination 172.16.0.21
 tunnel mode mpls traffic-eng
 tunnel mpls traffic-eng autoroute announce
 tunnel mpls traffic-eng priority 7 7
 tunnel mpls traffic-eng bandwidth  300
 tunnel mpls traffic-eng path-option 1 explicit identifier 1
 no routing dynamic
!
interface Tunnel1
 ip unnumbered Loopback0
 tunnel destination 172.16.0.21
 tunnel mode mpls traffic-eng
 tunnel mpls traffic-eng autoroute announce
 tunnel mpls traffic-eng priority 7 7
 tunnel mpls traffic-eng bandwidth  500
 tunnel mpls traffic-eng path-option 1 explicit identifier 2
 no routing dynamic
```

... you get two equal-cost paths in your IP routing table even though the **tunnel mpls traffic-eng bandwidths** are different:

``` {.code}
a1#show ip route ospf
  172.16.0.0 255.255.0.0 is variably subnetted, 6 subnets, 2 masks
O  172.16.0.21 255.255.255.255 [110/51] via 0.0.0.0, 00:11:06, Tunnel0
                               [110/51] via 0.0.0.0, 00:11:06, Tunnel1
O  172.16.0.22 255.255.255.255 [110/52] via 0.0.0.0, 00:11:06, Tunnel0
                               [110/52] via 0.0.0.0, 00:11:06, Tunnel1
```

When transferring the IP routing table into the CEF table, the router takes MPLS TE bandwidth in consideration, [resulting in unequal traffic split](https://blog.ipspace.net/2006/10/cef-load-sharing-details.html) proportional to the MPLS TE bandwidth:
