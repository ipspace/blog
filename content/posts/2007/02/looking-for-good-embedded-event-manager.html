I've started collecting interesting EEM solutions, for example:<br/><ul><li>Automatic midnight upload of router configuration if it has been changed during the previous day (section <em>Advanced deployment scenarios</em> in the <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner">IP Corner</a> article <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/RouterConfigArch/">Keep Track of Router Configurations with Configuration Archive</a>).</li>
<li>Report state changes in tracked objects (section Monitoring reliable static routing in the <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner">IP Corner</a> article <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/SmallSiteMultiHoming/">Small Site Multi-homing</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/02/reporting-state-of-ip-route.html">Report IP route appearance or disappearance</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/01/log-ip-sla-failures.html">React on IP SLA failures on out-of-bounds measurements</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2006/11/cli-command-logging-without-tacacs.html">Log console commands</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2006/10/periodic-router-reload.html">Periodic router reload</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an interesting challenge that you think might be solvable with EEM, please let me know (use the <em>Send a message to Ivan </em>link in <a href="http://www.zaplana.net/Articles/about.asp">my bio page</a>) ... after reading the following smallprint:</p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:85%;">I might not be able to respond to all your mail requests. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:85%;">By sending me your problem, you're agreeing that I'm free to post its solution together with a (heavily reworded) description of your problem in this blog as well as any other publication I might decide to author.</span></li>
</ul>
