Named <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps5413/products_feature_guide09186a00801d862d.html">reliable static routing</a>, this feature allows you to constantly ping next-hop router (or any other IP address) and use the static routes only if the tested destination is reachable.<br/><br/>While the reliable static routes are easy to understand and configure, a careless implementation can lead to interesting routing loops or other instability problems. You'll find the needed in-depth design and implementation guidelines in my <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/">IP Corner</a> article <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/SmallSiteMultiHoming/">Small Site Multi-homing</a> (which is one of the prime applications for reliable static routing) in sections Not-so-Very-Static-Routes and End-to-End Connectivity Test.
