When writing <acronym title="Embedded Event Manager">EEM</acronym> applets or policies that act on CLI commands, keep in mind that the pattern matching is not context sensitive. For example, if you want to <a href="/2007/03/can-you-disable-reload-command.html">disable the reload command</a> and use the EEM applet …<pre class="code">event manager applet NoReload<br/> event cli pattern "reload" sync no skip yes</pre>… you cannot enter the <strong>action <em>x.y</em> reload</strong> configuration command any more (or any other command that includes the string <em>reload</em>).<br/><br/>To distinguish the reload command from other appearances of the same string, use the <em>^reload</em> pattern (reload occuring at the beginning of the line).<p class="note"><span>Trivia: </span>this actually occured to me when I was testing the setup described in the December IP Corner article. Sometimes we have to learn the hard way :)</p>
