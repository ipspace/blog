With the introduction of <a href="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios124/124cg/hqos_c/part20/ch05/hrtlimt.htm">Control Plane Policing</a> features (available from 12.3(4)T), you can easily inspect all the open ports (servers and clients) on a router with the <strong>show control-plane host open-ports</strong> command, resulting in a printout very similar to the <em>netstat -a</em> printout on a Unix/Windows workstation.<!--more-->For example, on the router where I've configured BGP, HTTP server, NTP and DHCP, this command produces the following output (a session to a BGP neighbor as well as a telnet session was established):<pre class="code">R1#<strong>show control-plane host open-ports</strong><br/>Active internet connections (servers and established)<br/>Prot   Local Address  Foreign Address          Service    State<br/> tcp            *:23              *:0           Telnet   LISTEN<br/> tcp            *:80              *:0        HTTP CORE   LISTEN<br/> tcp           *:179              *:0              BGP   LISTEN<br/> tcp           *:179   10.0.7.2:43962              BGP ESTABLIS<br/> tcp            *:23   10.0.7.2:18036           Telnet ESTABLIS<br/> udp            *:67              *:0    DHCPD Receive   LISTEN<br/> udp            *:68              *:0     BootP client   LISTEN<br/> udp           *:123              *:0              NTP   LISTEN<br/></pre><div class="note"><span>Notes:</span><ul><li>This show command does not display non-TCP/UDP servers (OSPF, EIGRP, RSVP) or even some UDP-based services (RIP).</li>
<li>Although I was considering writing about CPP for a long time, Artur Szymanski was the one that brought this command to my attention. Thanks!</li>
