The new <a href="http://www.nil.com/C1256F0A00429755/html/remote_labs_portfolio">remote lab product</a> we've just released gives you the opportunity to test a number of OSPF concepts and configuration techniques. The <a href="http://www.nil.com/ls/LB_RL_OSPF_Tech">Open Shortest Path First - Complete Technology lab bundle</a> is a collection of exercises taken from standard Cisco courses (BSCI, MPLS and IP6FD) enhanced by specific OSPF scenarios (Non-Broadcast Multi-Access, Sham link support) and complete real-life deployment scenario (OSPF Superlab), enabling you to gain advanced skills in configuring and monitoring OSPF in complex and diverse network environments.
