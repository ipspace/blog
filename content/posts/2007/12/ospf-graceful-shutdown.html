You can read the in-depth discussion of design and implementation aspects of OSPF stub router functionality in the December <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner">IP Corner</a> article: <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/OSPFGracefulShutdown/">Bring your Network Closer to Five Nines with Graceful Shutdown</a>.
