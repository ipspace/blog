What do geeks do when they <a href="http://xkcd.com/361/">wait for Santa</a>? At least some of them tweak their Blogger template ... and so my blog got a completely new look-and-feel (after I've spent three months managing to postpone this task). Any opinions and suggestions are most welcome; after all, I'm not even close to a web designer.
