You've generated a lot of comments when I've <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/11/your-opinion-matters-full-versus-short.html">asked you about your opinion on the feed format I should use</a>. Thank you for your time and efforts!<br/><br/>Although the majority doesn't care what feed format I use, there are a few that would prefer the full feed â€¦ and I can understand that completely, as I am also reading a lot of content in my RSS reader. Therefore, I will not change the feed format until I will find means of giving you enough text in the shortened feed to enable you to make a decision as to whether the original post is worth reading. <br/><br/>Last but not least, I'll have to reduce the post frequency in the next few weeks due to other work I have to complete in this year and I'll vanish (temporarily) around Christmas, to be back in the first half of January.
