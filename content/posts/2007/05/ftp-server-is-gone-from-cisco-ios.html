It was a weird coincidence - yesterday I had to upgrade a 2800-series router and had no TFTP or FTP server available on my workstation, so I've tried to <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2006/10/use-cisco-ios-ftp-server-to-bypass.html">use the FTP server on the router</a>. The <strong>ftp-server</strong> command was not available, which did not surprise me at all, as I knew the FTP server was only available in selected IOS feature sets. However, as I finally found an USB key, transferred the Advanced IP Services 12.4(11)T image to the router's flash and reloaded the router, the real surprise came: the FTP server was still not there.<br /><br />Today I've got the bad news: I already knew there were "a few" bugs in the IOS FTP server <a href="http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070509-iosftp.shtml">that you could exploit</a>. Instead of fixing them, Cisco simply decided to remove the FTP server altogether.<br /><br />Why is this so bad? Look at the list of protocols that you can use to transfer files to and from the router that I've put together in my <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner">IP Corner</a> article <a href="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/WebUpload/">Using a Web Server to Manage Your Router Configurations</a>. As you cannot transfer a file into the router's flash with the embedded HTTP server, the only protocol that you could use to get a new IOS image to the router from a Windows workstation with no additional software installed was FTP, and now that option is gone.
