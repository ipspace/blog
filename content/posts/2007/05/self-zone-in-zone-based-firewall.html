<li>The <strong>self</strong> zone controls traffic <em>sent to the router itself</em> or <em>originated by the router</em>.</li>
<li>Unless you specify a <strong>zone-pair</strong> combining <strong>self</strong> zone with another zone, all traffic from that zone  sent to the router itself is allowed (the router is not protected)</li>
<li>To control traffic that the router can send into a zone use a <strong>zone-pair</strong> from <strong>self</strong> to another zone. Use <strong>inspect</strong> in the service-policy to allow the return traffic.</li>
<li>To filter the traffic that the router can accept, use a <strong>zone-pair</strong> from another zone to <strong>self</strong>. Only the packets accepted by this <strong>zone-pair</strong>'s <strong>service-policy</strong> will be accepted by the router.</li>
</ul>
More information about the self zone (as well as other aspects of zone-based firewall configuration) can be found in my digital book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P28WP8?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cisioshinandt-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000P28WP8">Deploying Zone-Based Firewalls</a> published by <a href="http://www.ciscopress.com/index.asp?rl=1">Cisco Press</a>.
