<li>Store Tcl procedures and <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/02/store-your-eem-tcl-policies-in-nvram.html">Embedded Event Manager policies</a>.</li>
<li>Store <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/01/ios-configuration-archive.html">configuration archives</a>.</li>
<li>Accumulate periodic printouts of show commands.</li>
