If you use UDP-based syslog servers, you might have noticed that they miss a message or two generated during a router reload (particularly when the syslog server is on a directly connected LAN). The reason is simple - when the first message is sent to the syslog server, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/04/why-is-first-ping-lost.html">its MAC address is not yet in the router's ARP cache and the message is dropped</a>. To prevent the message loss, you can use the <strong><a href="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios124/124cr/hiad_r/adr_l1h.htm#wp1119199">logging server-arp</a></strong> configuration command (introduced in IOS release 12.3T), making sure that the router sends ARP request to the configured syslog server(s) before generating the first syslog messages.<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> this issue does not occur when <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2006/10/running-syslog-over-tcp.html">using TCP as the syslog transport mechanism</a>.
