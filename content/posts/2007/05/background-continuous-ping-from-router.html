In <a href="/2007/04/continuous-ping-from-router.html">a previous post</a>, I've described how you could generate a (almost) continuous ping from a router using the extended ping command. While that approach is extremely simple to implement, it ties up a line (and if you're working from the console, it's highly impractical). You could get the same results (<a href="/2007/04/continuous-ping-from-router.html#comment-4326712837394116076">as Tom has already pointed out</a>) using IP SLA feature of Cisco IOS. Configure the ping request with commands similar to these:<pre class="code">ip sla 100<br/>  icmp-echo 172.16.1.2<br/>  timeout 500<br/>  frequency 3</pre>To start the ping, use the <strong>ip sla schedule 100 life forever start-time now</strong> configuration command, to stop it, <strong>no ip sla schedule 100</strong> command. When using IP SLA ping, you can trigger Embedded Event Manager applets to report ping failure (similar to the <a href="/2007/04/reload-router-when-ping-fails.html">technique described in this post</a>) or read the ping results from SLA MIB with SNMP.<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> In IOS release 12.3(14)T, the <strong>ip sla</strong> command replaced the <strong>rtr</strong> command. To use this technique in IOS release 12.3 or lower, use the <strong>rtr</strong> configuration command.
