<p>Whenever a router running CEF switching has LAN interfaces (or any other multi-access interfaces), you'll find <em>cached adjacencies</em> for active directly attached IP neighbors in its CEF table. These adjacencies ensure the smooth traffic flow toward the LAN-attached next-hops (preventing the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/04/why-is-first-ping-lost.html">initial packet drop symptom</a> once the next-hop becomes active).<!--more--></p>
<p>The cached adjacencies (for individual IP hosts) are created whenever the first packet is sent toward an IP destination covered by a glean adjacency and stay in the CEF table during the changes in IP routing table (even after the complete IP routing table is cleared with the <strong>clear ip route *</strong> command). The only way to remove them from the CEF table (although I can't see a good reason to do that) is to shutdown and re-enable the interface.</p>
<p>To display the cached adjacencies use the show ip cef destination mask longer-prefixes detail command, for example:</p>
<pre class="code">a2#<strong>show ip cef 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 longer detail</strong><br/>...
