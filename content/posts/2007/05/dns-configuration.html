With the introduction of <a href="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios124/124newft/124t/124t9/htspldns.htm">DNS views</a> in IOS release 12.4(9)T, a number of additional DNS-related configuration commands were introduced. As IOS still supports all the older configuration commands (and the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/05/dns-resolver-in-cisco-ios-is-auto.html">DHCP-acquired DNS servers</a>), the results are not as obvious as one would hope. The <a href="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios124/124newft/124t/124t9/htspldns.htm#wp1659106">IOS documentation</a> is pretty explicit (a nice surprise :), but I still had a bit of a headache figuring it all out, so you might be in the same position.<br/><br/>Let's start with the DNS resolvers (the DNS name servers the router itself uses when it needs to change a name into an IP address or vice versa):<ul><li>You can configure the DNS resolvers with the <strong>ip name-server</strong> global configuration command or the <strong>domain name-server</strong> configuration command within the <strong>ip dns view default</strong>.</li>
<li>Both lists are merged and combined <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/05/dns-resolver-in-cisco-ios-is-auto.html">with the IP addresses acquired from the DHCP reply messages</a> to get the final list of the DNS resolvers. You can inspect the final list with the <strong>show ip dns view default </strong>command.</li>
<li>The DNS name servers from the DHCP replies never appear in the router configuration.</li>
<li>If the same IP address is specified with the <strong>ip name-server </strong>and <strong>domain name-server </strong>command, only the global (<strong>ip name-server</strong>) command will appear in the router configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rules for DNS forwarders (the DNS servers the router uses to answer incoming DNS queries) are a bit different:</p>
<ul><li>The DNS view the current DNS query should use is determined based on <strong>view-list</strong> assigned to incoming interface (with the <strong>ip dns view-group</strong> interface configuration command) or the global view-list (specified with the <strong>ip dns server view-group</strong> global configuration command).</li>
<li>The incoming query is (sequentially) sent to the IP addresses configured as <strong>dns forwarders </strong>in the selected view. No other DNS servers are used.</li>
<li>If the selected view has no <strong>dns forwarders</strong>, but contains <strong>domain name-servers</strong>, they are used as forwarders.</li>
<li>If the selected view has no <strong>dns forwarders</strong> or <strong>domain name-servers</strong>, the query is forwarded as IP broadcast ... unless the selected view is the <strong>default</strong> view, in which case <em>the first</em> DNS server computed according to the the previous bullet list is used (only one DNS server is used in this case, even if you have configured multiple DNS servers with the <strong>ip name-server</strong> configuration command).</li>
</ul>
