IOS has (yet another) nice "underdocumented" feature - if you don't have an enable password/secret configured on your router, you can access IOS HTTP(S) server (assuming it's enabled with the <strong>ip http server</strong> command) without any authentication whatsoever. Of course you'd never do that in a production environment, but it's nice to know you can always configure the router from a web browser if needed (see also the <a href="/2007/01/default-username-on-cisco-routers.html">discussion on default passwords with Cisco SDM</a>).
