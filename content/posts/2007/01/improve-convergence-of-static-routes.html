Have you ever experienced a long wait between the moment you've configured a static route and its appearance in the IP routing table? The reason might be that Cisco IOS by default adjusts static routes every 60 seconds. IOS release 12.0(29)S (integrated in 12.3(10) and 12.4) fixes this problem with the <strong>ip route static adjust-time <em>seconds</em></strong> global configuration command.
