title: Firewalls kill TCP performance when faced with out-of-order packets
url: /2007/01/firewalls-kill-tcp-performance-when.html
---

In my <a href="/2006/12/per-destination-or-per-packet-cef-load.html">discussion of per-packet versus per-destination load sharing</a>, I've relied on the "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=performance+out-of-order+TCP+packets+site%3A.edu">accepted wisdom</a>" that out-of-order TCP packets reduce session performance (as a side note, out-of-order UDP packets are a true performance killer; just try running NFS with out-of-order packets).<br/><br/>Today I've discovered another huge show-stopper: stateful firewalls (read: almost everything in use today) might just drop out-of-order packets, resulting in TCP timeouts and retransmissions (and repeated timeouts will totally wreck the session throughput). Here's how Cisco devices handle this problem:<br/><ul><li>PIX allows <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6120/products_command_reference_chapter09186a00805fb9f9.html#wp1322021">three out-of-order packets per TCP session</a> (cannot be changed, but should be enough)</li>
<br/><li>You can <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6120/products_command_reference_chapter09186a00805fb9db.html#wp1598973">configure out-of-order packet handling on ASA</a> with the <strong>queue-lenght</strong> parameter of a <strong>tcp-map</strong></li>
.<br/><li>Cisco IOS firewall (formerly known as CBAC) drops out-of-order packets <a href="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios124/124newft/124t/124t11/ht_ooop.htm">until release 12.4(11)T</a> where you can use the <strong>ip inspect tcp reassembly</strong> configuration command (and it looks like the <a href="/2006/11/deploying-zone-based-firewalls.html">zone-based firewall configuration</a> is not yet supported).</li>
</ul>
