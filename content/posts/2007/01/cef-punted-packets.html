The packets that cannot be CEF-switched in a box with CEF switching enabled are <em>punted</em> to the next switching level (fast switching or process switching). The incoming packets can be punted for a number of reasons, for example:<ul><li>If the destination is reachable over an interface that cannot use CEF-switching due to a feature not supported by CEF (for example, X.25 link), the packet has to be fast- or process-switched.</li>
</ul>
<p class="info">These destinations are easily discovered by <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/01/cef-punt-adjancency.html">inspecting the punt adjacencies</a>).</p>
<ul><li>All packets destined for the router itself are process switched (thus punted).</li>
<li>If the router needs to reply back to the source with an ICMP packet (redirect, unreachable ...), the reply can be generated only in the process-switching path.</li>
<li>All packets with the IP options are punted to process switching.</li>
<li>Fragments that have to be processed by the router are also process-switched.</li>
</ul>
You can inspect the amount of punted packets with the <strong>show cef not-cef-switched</strong> command.<p class="more">This article is part of <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/01/youve-asked-for-it-series.html">You've asked for it</a> <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/search/label/You%27ve%20asked%20for%20it">series</a>.</p>
