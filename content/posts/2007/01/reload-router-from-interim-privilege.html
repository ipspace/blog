While you wouldn't usually want non-privileged user to reload a Cisco IOS-based router, you might also not appreciate the need to give the network operator level-15 access (which includes configuration privileges) just to reload the box. The solution is the <strong>privilege</strong> configuration command. To lower the privilege level of the reload command, configure <strong>privilege exec level <em>desired-level</em> reload</strong>.<!--more-->For example, after configuring ...<pre class="code">privilege exec level 4 reload<br/>enable secret level 4 mypassword</pre>... an operator can reload the box with the following commands:<pre class="code">Rtr&gt;<strong>enable 4</strong><br/>Password:<br/>Rtr#<strong>reload</strong><br/>System configuration has been modified. Save? [yes/no]: <strong>n</strong><br/>Proceed with reload? [confirm]<strong>y</strong><br/>14:11:13: %SYS-5-RELOAD: Reload requested by console.</pre><strong>Note:</strong> this article is part of <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/01/youve-asked-for-it-series.html">You've asked for it</a> <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/search/label/You%27ve%20asked%20for%20it">series</a>.
