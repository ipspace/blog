title: Default username on Cisco routers

I get a lot of hits via Google from people searching for a <em>default username on Cisco router</em>. It's ages-old news, but <em><strong>there is no default username</strong></em>. Period. If you have to get access to a router and cannot remember the password(s), the only thing left is the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/474/index.shtml">password recovery mechanism</a> ... although even that can be disabled with the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/routers/ps274/products_configuration_example09186a00801d8113.shtml">no service password-recovery</a> configuration command.<br/><br/>There are, however, a few things you can do if you want to relax the access to your router in a lab environment (never do it in a production network):<ul><li>If you configure <strong>no enable password</strong>, you can switch to enable mode without supplying a password</li>
<li>If you want to telnet to a router without supplying a password, configure <strong>no login</strong> on the vty lines.</li>
<li>If you want to be in privilege mode immediately after accessing the router, configure <strong>privilege <em>level</em></strong> on the console or vty lines.</li>
</ul>
