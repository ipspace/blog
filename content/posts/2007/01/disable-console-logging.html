Large amount of logging output (most often produced in a debugging process) sent to a router's console can significantly increase the router's CPU load and even stop the box from forwarding packets (high-end routers with distributed forwarding architecture are obviously an exception, but even they can lose routing adjacencies). The reason is very simple - console interrupt is one of the highest-priority interrupts on the router (otherwise you wouldn't be able to get a response to the BREAK key on a hung box).<br/><br/><strong>Update January 9th 2007:</strong> The router does not check if a user is logged into the console port or a device (for example, a terminal) is attached to it; if console logging is enabled, messages are always sent to the console port (causing CPU load).<br/><br/>To stop the console logging, use the <strong>no logging console </strong>global configuration command (highly recommended for routers that are not usually accessed through the console port) or you might want to limit the amount of messages sent to the console with the <strong>logging console <em>level</em></strong> configuration command (for example, <strong>logging console notifications</strong>).<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> this article is part of <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/01/youve-asked-for-it-series.html">You've asked for it</a> <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/tag/youve-asked-for-it.html">series</a>.
