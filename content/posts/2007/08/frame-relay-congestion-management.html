<p>In the <em>“good old days”</em> we've been teaching our students that although a router can act as a Frame Relay switch, it supports only the rudimentary functionality of switching the packets, but not the policing/marking features available in Frame Relay switches. That hasn't been true for a while - in IOS release 12.1T, Cisco has introduced the congestion management features. You can specify the congestion management per-interface (with the <strong>frame-relay congestion-management</strong> interface configuration command) and <a href="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios122/122newft/122tcr/122twr/wftfr4.htm#wp1030378">set the DE drop/ECN mark percentages</a> for all PVCs on the interface or you can <a href="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios122/122newft/122tcr/122twr/wftfr1.htm#wp1041520">set the parameters within a map-class</a>.</p>
<p class="note">I don't know how useful this feature is to you; I was fond of finding it because it solves some interesting problems I had a (long) while ago. If you need more in-depth description or actual configurations, post a comment or <a href="http://www.zaplana.net/Articles/about.asp">send me a message</a>.</p>
