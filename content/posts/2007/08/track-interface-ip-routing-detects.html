The <strong>track <em>number</em> interface <em>name</em> ip routing</strong> command is supposed to track an interface readiness to forward IP packets. In reality, it only tracks the interface line protocol status plus the IPCP status in case of PPP interfaces (as well as the actual presence of an IP address on the interface). If you configure IP Event Dampening (with the <strong>dampening</strong>) command, the interface might be suppressed (unavailable for IP routing), but the track object will report it as available (tested on IOS release 12.4(6)T). This could result in suboptimal HSRP/GLBP decisions if you use <strong>track</strong> objects to influence HSRP/GLBP priority or actual loss of data if you use such a <strong>track</strong> object to control policy-based routing.<!--more-->For example, with the following configuration ...<pre class="code">interface Serial0/1/0<br/>dampening 15 500 2000 60 restart 500<br/>!<br/>track 1 interface Serial0/1/0 ip routing</pre>... the interface might be suppressed while the track object would report it's up:<pre class="code">router#<strong>show interfaces dampening</strong><br/>Serial0/1/0<br/>Flaps Penalty Supp ReuseTm HalfL ReuseV SuppV ...<br/>0 3235 <span class="high">TRUE</span> 42 15 500 2000 ...<br/>router#<strong>show track 1</strong><br/>Track 1<br/>Interface Serial0/1/0 ip routing<br/><span class="high">IP routing is Up</span><br/>27 changes, last change 00:03:37<br/>Tracked by:<br/>1207165940</pre>
