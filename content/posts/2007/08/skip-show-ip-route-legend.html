Are you as upset as I am with the constant display of the legend in front of the routes displayed with the <strong>show ip route</strong> command? Two output filters can help you.<!--more-->The easier one is <strong>show ip route <em>parameters</em> ¦ begin Gateway</strong> (as there is always a line starting with <em>Gateway of last resort</em> ...) before the actual IP routes:<pre class="code">a1#<strong>show ip route 172.16.0.0 longer ¦ begin Gateway</strong><br/>Gateway of last resort is not set<br/><br/>     172.16.0.0 255.255.0.0 is variably subnetted, 4 subnets, 2 masks<br/>O       172.16.0.21 255.255.255.255<br/>           [110/51] via 172.18.1.2, 00:04:56, Serial0/0/0.100<br/>O       172.16.0.12 255.255.255.255<br/>           [110/65] via 172.18.1.6, 00:04:56, Serial0/1/0<br/>C       172.16.0.11 255.255.255.255 is directly connected, Loopback0<br/>O       172.16.1.4 255.255.255.252<br/>           [110/113] via 172.18.1.6, 00:04:56, Serial0/1/0</pre>A slightly more complex one matches the first line that has a digit after the leading white space.<pre class="code">a1#<strong>show ip route 172.16.0.0 longer ¦ begin ^ +[0-9]+</strong><br/>     172.16.0.0 255.255.0.0 is variably subnetted, 4 subnets, 2 masks<br/>O       172.16.0.21 255.255.255.255<br/>           [110/51] via 172.18.1.2, 00:08:55, Serial0/0/0.100<br/>O       172.16.0.12 255.255.255.255<br/>           [110/65] via 172.18.1.6, 00:08:55, Serial0/1/0<br/>C       172.16.0.11 255.255.255.255 is directly connected, Loopback0<br/>O       172.16.1.4 255.255.255.252<br/>           [110/113] via 172.18.1.6, 00:08:55, Serial0/1/0</pre><p class="note">If only IOS would have more decent regular expressions, like \s and \d ...</p>
