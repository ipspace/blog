As <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/07/update-show-ip-interface-command-i.html#comment-6385987021546090807">Roddie pointed out in his comment</a>, in some cases tclsh writes its output to the first line (usually console), not to the current line as expected. This &ldquo;feature&rdquo; has been introduced in IOS release 12.4(6)T1 (12.4(6)T is still OK) and fixed sometime before IOS release 12.4(11)T; 12.4(9)T is still broken (and I haven't tried all the other interim rebuilds ... or shall I call them rebreaks?).
