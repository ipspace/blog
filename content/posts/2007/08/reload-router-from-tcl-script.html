In his comment, <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/04/execute-multiple-commands-at-once.html#comment-5486970742912595091">Michal has asked about the ability to execute IOS commands with prompts from Tcl shell</a>. I haven't found a generic solution yet, but you can reload a router from a Tcl script. First you have to define an <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/tag/eem.html">EEM applet</a> that <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/04/reload-router-when-ping-fails.html">reloads the router</a> and can be triggered from command-line interface:<pre class="code">event manager applet forceReload<br/> event none<br/> action 1.0 reload</pre>Now you can use the <strong><a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/04/executing-ios-commands-from-tcl-shell.html">exec</a> "event manager run forceReload"</strong> Tcl command in your Tcl script to run the applet (and reload the router).<br/><br/><div class="note"><p>Notes:</p>
<ul><li>To execute file management commands from Tcl shell, you have to <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/05/reload-eem-tcl-policy-with-help-of-tcl.html">disable prompts</a> with <strong>file prompt quiet</strong> configuration command;</li>
