If you have configured your router as a DHCP client, you can use the <em>default router</em> option received in a DHCP reply as the next-hop for a static route. For example:<pre class="code">ip route 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 dhcp</pre>You could use this functionality in scenarios where your core network uses DHCP (for example, in metropolitan networks using layer-2 Ethernet transport from an ISP), but your router needs a different default route.<br/><br/>You can also use this feature to change the administrative distance of the DHCP-based default route (or you could use the <strong>ip dhcp-client default-router distance <em>value</em></strong> configuration command that <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/08/default-dhcp-client-id.html#comment-2928686131739378839">one of the readers described in a comment</a> to a <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/08/default-dhcp-client-id.html">previous DHCP-related post</a>).<br/><br/>Any other good ideas where this might come handy? Post them as comments ...
