The <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/07/update-show-ip-interface-command-i.html#comment-4846265386591777422">comment made by Xavier</a> sent me searching the Cisco documentation for the <strong>scripting tcl low-memory</strong> command. While I was not able to find anything useful (even links to some other <strong>scripting</strong> commands point to nowhere), I've discovered this gem - a <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6555/prod_presentation0900aecd805456f7.pdf">great presentation explaining Tcl, EEM, ESM, ERM and Kron</a>. Highly recommended reading :)<br/><br/><ins class="corr">Update @ 2009-03-05: fixed the link to the presentation</ins>
