Contrary to what the regular reload does, the <a href="/2007/04/warm-reload.html">warm reload</a> does not change the configuration register value (obviously that's done by ROMMON, which is not involved in the warm reload process). If you just did a password recovery and changed the configuration register back to a normal value, you'd thus be unpleasantly surprised when the NVRAM would be ignored (yet again) after a warm reload (I stumbled across this as I was <a href="/2007/05/warm-upgrade.html">trying a new IOS release</a> with the <strong>reload warm file <em>URL</em></strong> command).
