One of my readers asked for a working configuration of the <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/06/ospf-default-route-design-scenarios.html">conditional OSPF default route advertisment feature</a>. In my scenario, the OSPF default route would be announced whenever an Internet prefix (172.18.0.0/16) would be present in the IP routing table.<pre class="code">router ospf 1<br/> log-adjacency-changes<br/> network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0<br/> default-information originate always route-map FromInternet<br/>!<br/>router bgp 11<br/> bgp log-neighbor-changes<br/> neighbor 172.16.1.2 remote-as 21<br/>!<br/>ip access-list standard FromInternet<br/> permit 172.18.0.0<br/>!<br/>route-map FromInternet permit 10<br/> match ip address FromInternet</pre><div class="warn">Caveats:<br/><ul><li>The route map configured in the <strong>default-information originate</strong> command tests the IP prefixes in the IP routing table. You can thus match only on those attributes that are present in the IP routing table (IP prefix, metric, next-hop), not on additional BGP attributes (like AS-path), which would be really cool</li>
<li>Contrary to what <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2007/06/ospf-default-route-design-scenarios.html#comment-5507351136262865205">Sebastian wrote in his comment</a>, you don't have to redistribute BGP route into OSPF to make it work in IOS release 12.4(11)T or 12.2SRC, but the IP prefix you test cannot be a subnet.</li>
</ul>
