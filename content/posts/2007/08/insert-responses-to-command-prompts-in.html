I have been aware of the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps5207/products_feature_guide09186a00801a75a7.html#wp1027195"><strong>typeahead</strong></a> Tcl command for months, but somehow I never got it to work. It works perfectly in IOS release 12.4(15)T (it might have something to do with <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/08/you-fix-some-you-break-some.html">other fixes to Tclsh</a>), so to clear interface counters (<a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/04/execute-multiple-commands-at-once.html#comment-1688346259298046702">as Michal would like to do</a>), this is what you can do:<pre class='code'>typeahead "y"<br />exec "clear counter dialer 0";</pre><script>startHide()</script><strong>Warning: </strong>if the input is not consumed by the executed commands, it stays in the typeahead buffer; quite dangerous if you have a sequence of commands, as the wrong command could be acknowledged. <p class='info'>An <a href="http://wiki.nil.com/Insert_responses_to_command_prompts_in_Tclsh">in-depth version of this article</a> is available in the CT3 wiki.</p>
