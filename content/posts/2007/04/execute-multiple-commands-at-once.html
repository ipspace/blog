Sometimes you'd like to automate execution of command sequences or create a command alias that would trigger a series of commands. One way of achieving this is by creating an EEM applet. For example, to clear IP routing table and reset BGP neighbors, define the following EEM applet:<pre class="code">event manager applet ClearAll<br/> event none<br/> action 1.0 cli command "clear ip route *"<br/> action 2.0 cli command "clear ip bgp *"</pre>You can trigger this applet with the <strong>event manager run ClearAll</strong> command or you could <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2006/10/use-command-aliases-to-simplify-cisco.html">configure a command alias</a>, for example <strong>alias exec cleanup event manager run ClearAll</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> this article is part of <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/01/youve-asked-for-it-series.html">You've asked for it</a> <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/search/label/You%27ve%20asked%20for%20it">series</a>.
