By default, IOS routers use enable passwords to authenticate incoming HTTP (web) requests. You could also <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2006/10/multilevel-web-http-access-to-router.html">use local usernames as the authentication mechanism</a>, or you could deploy full-blown AAA-based solution.<!--more-->To enable AAA-based HTTP authentication, you have to define two AAA lists (<strong>authentication login</strong> and <strong>authorization exec</strong>) and bind them to the HTTP server with the <strong>ip http authentication aaa command</strong>. A working configuration example is included below (this one uses AAA-based local username authentication, but of course you can replace that with RADIUS- or TACACS-based one).<pre class="code">aaa authentication login web local<br/>aaa authorization exec web local<br/>!<br/>ip http authentication aaa login-authentication web<br/>ip http authentication aaa exec-authorization web</pre><strong>Warning</strong>: the router executes AAA authentication/authorization for every HTTP request sent by the browser. It's thus very hard to integrate this solution with one-time passwords (unless you can cache the credentials on the AAA server).
