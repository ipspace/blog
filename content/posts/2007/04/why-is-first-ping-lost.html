<p>When pinging a directly-attached host (end-station) from a router, it's quite common to lose the first reply, as shown in the following example (the same symptom might occur when pinging a remote host that has been inactive).</p>
<pre class="code">a2#<strong>ping 10.0.0.10</strong><br/><br/>Type escape sequence to abort.<br/>Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.0.0.10, timeout is 2 seconds:<br/>.!!!!<br/>Success rate is 80 percent (4/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/1/4 ms</pre><p>Actually, it's not the reply that was lost, the request was never sent out. Whenever a router has to send a packet to the next-hop (or directly attached destination) that has no entry in the ARP table, the ARP request is sent out, but the original packet is unconditionally dropped.<!--more--></p>
<p>You can easily test this behavior in the lab (live networks are too busy for that) by debugging ARP requests while performing the ping command:</p>
<pre class="code">a2#<strong>show arp</strong><br/>Protocol  Address          Age (min)  Hardware Addr   Type   Interface<br/>Internet  10.0.0.6                -   0016.c876.8b38  ARPA   FastEthernet0/0<br/>Internet  10.0.0.5                0   0016.c7fe.f150  ARPA   FastEthernet0/0<br/>a2#<strong>debug arp</strong><br/>ARP packet debugging is on<br/>a2#<strong>ping 10.0.0.10</strong><br/><br/>Type escape sequence to abort.<br/>Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.0.0.10, timeout is 2 seconds:<br/>.!!!!<br/>Success rate is 80 percent (4/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/1/4 ms<br/>08:26:21: IP ARP: creating incomplete entry for IP address: 10.0.0.10 interface<br/>FastEthernet0/0<br/>08:26:21: IP ARP: sent req src 10.0.0.6 0016.c876.8b38,<br/>                 dst 10.0.0.10 0000.0000.0000 FastEthernet0/0<br/>08:26:21: IP ARP: rcvd rep src 10.0.0.10 000c.29a7.8ade, dst 10.0.0.6 FastEthernet0/0</pre>
