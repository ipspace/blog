Sometimes, parts of router configuration get lost during the reload process: although the configuration commands are saved in NVRAM, they are not processed after the reload and thus do not appear in the running configuration. Re-entering these commands manually solves the problem ... but it's obviously not a reliable solution.<br/><br/>Embedded Event Manager (EEM) solves this issue as well. You just configure an applet that triggers on <em>syslog</em> message SYS-5-RESTART and reapplies the necessary configuration commands.<!--more-->For example, to fix the bug CSCsf32390, Cisco recomments the following applet:<pre class="code">event manager applet add-buffer<br/> event syslog occurs 1 pattern "%SYS-5-RESTART: System restarted"<br/>action 1.0 cli command "enable"<br/>action 2.0 cli command "configure terminal"<br/>action 3.0 cli command "buffers particle-clone 16384"<br/>action 4.0 cli command "buffers header 4096"<br/>action 5.0 cli command "buffers fastswitching 8192"<br/>action 6.0 syslog msg "Reinstated buffers command"</pre>
