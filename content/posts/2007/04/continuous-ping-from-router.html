A lot of people arriving to my blog <a href="/2007/01/youve-asked-for-it-series/">ask about</a> continuous ping performed from a router. Well, you cannot generate never-ending ping from a command line interface, but you can get pretty close with a very large repeat count:<ul><li>Before starting the ping, <a href="/2007/03/stop-extended-ping-or-traceroute/">set the line escape character to something you can generate from your keyboard </a>(otherwise you won't be able to stop end the command). For example, terminal escape 3 will set the escape character to Ctrl-C.</li>
<li><a href="/2007/03/one-line-extended-ping/">Start the ping</a> with the <strong>ping ip <em>destination</em> repeat <em>very-large-value</em></strong> command. For example, <strong>ping ip 10.0.0.1 repeat 1000000</strong> will ping the target host longer than you'll be willing to wait.</li>
</ul>
