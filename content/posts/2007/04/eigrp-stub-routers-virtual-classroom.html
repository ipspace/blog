Now you can augment the article with a <a href="http://www.nil.com/C125726f00447899/html/eigrpstubrecording/$FILE/eigrpstub.wmv">recording of the virtual classroom presentation</a> I did a few days ago, which gives you even more in-depth details on the stub router technology and modifications Cisco made to EIGRP algorithms.
