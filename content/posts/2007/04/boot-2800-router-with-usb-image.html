If you would like to boot an ISR router (for example, a 2800) from USB flash, but cannot <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/02/upgrade-2800-series-router-to-support.html">upgrade the ROMMON</a>, all is not lost - you can specify the USB-based image with the <strong>boot system</strong> configuration command (for example, <strong>boot system usbflash1:c2800nm-advipservicesk9-mz.124-11.T1.bin</strong>), but the boot process will take significantly longer (this also applies to any other scenarios where the ROMMON cannot get the image specified in the boot system command):<ul><li>When the router is reloaded, ROMMON reads the router configuration and tries to start the required image</li>
<li>If ROMMON cannot load the image specified in the boot system command, it starts the default image (usually whatever is stored in on-board flash)</li>
<li>When the first IOS image loads (after being copied and decompressed in most cases), it discovers that it's not the correct image</li>
<li>The now-operational IOS image loads the new image in RAM (in our case from <strong>usbflash1:</strong>), decompresses it and transfers the control to it</li>
</ul>
