title: 'Summarize IOS printouts (example: Frame Relay DLCIs)'

I've always wanted a short summary display of DLCIs configured on my Frame Relay boxes (or whatever your favorite WAN technology is), but the only printout I would get from the router would be the lengthy <strong>show frame pvc</strong> printout. Fortunately, a judicious use of output filters can get you a summary printout from almost anything Cisco IOS produces.<!--more-->For example, I would like to see just the highlighted lines in my <strong>show frame pvc</strong> printout:<pre class="code">b2#<strong>show frame pvc</strong><br/><br/><span class="high">PVC Statistics for interface Serial0/0/0 (Frame Relay DTE)</span><br/><br/>              Active     Inactive      Deleted       Static<br/>  Local          1            0            0            0<br/>  Switched       0            0            0            0<br/>  Unused         3            0            0            0<br/><br/><span class="high">DLCI = 101, DLCI USAGE = LOCAL, PVC STATUS = ACTIVE, INTERFACE = Serial0/0/0.101</span><br/><br/>  input pkts 1003          output pkts 948          in bytes 107601<br/>  out bytes 106438         dropped pkts 68          in pkts dropped 68<br/>  out pkts dropped 0       out bytes dropped 0<br/>... rest deleted ...</pre>The first line I'm interested in contains the pattern <em>for interface</em>, the second one <em>DLCI USAGE</em>. My output filter would thus have to match any one of these patterns:<pre class="code">b2#<strong>show frame pvc ¦ include (for interface¦DLCI USAGE)</strong><br/>PVC Statistics for interface Serial0/0/0 (Frame Relay DTE)<br/>DLCI = 101, DLCI USAGE = LOCAL, PVC STATUS = ACTIVE, INTERFACE = Serial0/0/0.101<br/>DLCI = 201, DLCI USAGE = UNUSED, PVC STATUS = ACTIVE, INTERFACE = Serial0/0/0<br/>DLCI = 302, DLCI USAGE = UNUSED, PVC STATUS = ACTIVE, INTERFACE = Serial0/0/0<br/>DLCI = 401, DLCI USAGE = UNUSED, PVC STATUS = ACTIVE, INTERFACE = Serial0/0/0</pre>And to add icing on the cake, I defined an alias with the <strong>alias exec dlci show frame pvc ¦ include (for interface ¦ DLCI USAGE)</strong> configuration command. Now I can display the FR DLCI status with a simple <strong>dlci</strong> command.
