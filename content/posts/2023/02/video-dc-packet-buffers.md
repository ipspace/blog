A few years ago, we were fortunate enough to have [Pete Lumbis](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Pete_Lumbis) talking about [ASICs for Networking Engineers](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DCFabric#TECHNOLOGY) as part of the [Data Center Fabric Architectures](https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics) webinar.

One of the topics he couldn't possible skip was the question of [how many packet buffers one needs](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/DCFabric/AS3%20-%20Packet%20Buffers.mp4?doccode=DCFabric) in a data center switch.
