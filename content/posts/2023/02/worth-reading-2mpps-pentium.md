Robert Graham published a blog post describing how his IDS/IPS system [handled 2 Mpps on a Pentium III CPU 20 years ago](https://blog.erratasec.com/2023/01/im-still-bitter-about-slammer.html)... and yet [some people keep claiming](https://blog.ipspace.net/2023/01/data-center-tcp-replacement.html) that "_Driving a 100 Gbps network at 80% utilization in both directions consumes 10â€“20 cores just in the networking stack_" (in 2023). I guess a suboptimal-enough implementation can still consume all the CPU cycles it can get and then some.
