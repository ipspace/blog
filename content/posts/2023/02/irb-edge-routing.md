The simplest way to implement layer-3 forwarding in a network fabric is to offload it to an external device[^R6], be it a WAN edge router, a firewall, a load balancer, or any other network appliance.

While the hipsters sipping EVPN Kool-Aid might consider that approach a design from the 1990s, it's used more often than you might expect, for example:

[^R6]: Proving RFC 1925 Rule 6

-   When the majority of the traffic goes through a WAN edge router toward external destinations;
-   When all the traffic between a subnet and external destinations has to be inspected by a security appliance;
-   When you're using virtual network appliances in combination with layer-2-only overlay virtual networks[^ACI];
-   When the amount of routed traffic is small, and the vendor overcharges for layer-3 forwarding capabilities in the fabric switches[^VOC];
-   In aggregation networks, when switch ports are way cheaper than router ports, it makes sense to aggregate the traffic in a layer-2 switch and forward it through a single faster port to a router[^100G].

[^ACI]: Which happens to be the case in many Cisco ACI deployments due to the inherent complexity of more comprehensive designs.

[^VOC]: One would hope that's not the case in 2023, but I stopped being surprised at vendor shenanigans a long while ago.

[^100G]: You REALLY don't want to have a dozen 100G ports with average utilization below 10% on a reassuringly expensive carrier-grade router.

This design seems like the simplest possible thing you might be asked to implement until someone says, "_but we need two edge devices for redundancy._" Welcome to the first-hop redundancy hell.

In a perfect world, everyone would be using IPv6, the IPv6 hosts would happily load-balance traffic between multiple adjacent routers, and we could fine-tune the router advertisement (RA) messages to allow a sub-second failover on a router failure.

Meanwhile, on Planet Earth:

-   Way too many environments still use IPv4.
-   Most IP hosts use a single default route toward a single default gateway, and that default gateway can have a single MAC address.
-   RA-based redundancy is often considered too slow (seeÂ [IPv6 High Availability Strategies](https://www.ipspace.net/IPv6_High_Availability_Strategies) webinar for more details), so we have to use [first-hop redundancy protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-hop_redundancy_protocol) even in IPv6 deployments.

Even worse, we can't use active-active FHRP implementations or anycast gateways in this design because we cannot have the same MAC address (the MAC address of the first-hop router) present on two fabric ports.

There are no good solutions to this problem; the only thing you can do is to choose one that sucks the least:[^YPO]

[^YPO]: In your personal opinion ;), we're deep in the It Depends territory.

-   Use each device as the first-hop gateway for half of the subnets and hope that you got it right and that a sudden increase in traffic won't bring down one of the devices[^FWC].
-   Use active/active FHRP implementation or an anycast gateway with a link aggregation group (LAG) between the fabric and the redundant devices. The LAG makes redundant devices appear as a single node in the network fabric so that they can use the same MAC address. Have fun dealing with MLAG implementations on both ends of those links.
-   Use a proprietary implementation like [GLBP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Load_Balancing_Protocol) that uses different MAC addresses in ARP replies for the same IP address, effectively spreading the load across redundant devices based on the host ARP entries.
-   Give up and accept that having a redundant solution that is more than 50% loaded doesn't make sense anyway. That will make your CFO unhappy, but you might still have a running network after one of the devices fails during the peak traffic period.

[^FWC]: One of my customers managed to (consistently) crash a firewall from a major vendor when doing daily backups over the network.

### What's Next?

Subsequent blog posts will focus on the intricate details of intra-fabric routing, but it might take me a while to publish them. If you're in a hurry, you'll find those details in [Leaf-and-Spine Fabric Architectures](https://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Architectures) and [EVPN Technical Deep Dive](https://www.ipspace.net/EVPN_Technical_Deep_Dive) webinars.
