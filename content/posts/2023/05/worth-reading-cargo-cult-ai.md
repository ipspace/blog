Before we managed to recover from the [automation cargo cults](https://blog.ipspace.net/2023/01/network-automation-expert-beginners.html), a tsunami wave of [cargo cult AI](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&id=3595860) washed over us as Edlyn V. Levine explained in an ACM Queue article. Enjoy ;)

Also, a bit of a historical perspective is never a bad thing:

> Impressive progress in AI, including the recent sensation of ChatGPT, has been dominated by the success of a single, decades-old machine-learning approach called a multilayer (or deep) neural network. This approach was invented in the 1940s, and essentially all of the foundational concepts of neural networks  and associated methods—including convolutional neural networks and backpropagation—were in place by the 1980s.
