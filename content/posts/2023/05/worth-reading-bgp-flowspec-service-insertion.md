[Nicola Modena](https://www.ipspace.net/Expert:Nicola_Modena) had an interesting presentation describing [how you can use BGP FlowSpec for traffic steering and service insertion](http://blog.modena.to/2023/05/bgp-is-answer-what-is-question.html) during the recent [ITNOG 7](https://www.itnog.it/itnog7/) event (more about the event in a few days).

One of the slides explained how to use three different aspects of BGP (FlowSpec, MPLS/VPN and multipathing), prompting me to claim the presentation title should be "_BGP is the answer, what was the question?_" ðŸ˜‰ Hope you'll enjoy the PDF version of the presentation as much as we did the live one.
