I joined Twitter in October 2008 (after noticing everyone else was using it during a Networking Field Day event), and eventually figured out how to automate posting the links to my blog posts in case someone uses Twitter as their primary source of news.

This week, I got a nice email from IFTTT (the solution I used) telling me they had to disable the post-to-Twitter applet. Twitter started charging for the API, and I was using their free service -- obviously the math didn't work out.

That left me with three options:
<!--more-->
* Pay for the post-to-Twitter service (IFTTT Pro). It's peanuts, but using a gazillion $1.99/month services eventually adds up.
* Post the links manually. That's a hassle, and as I'm getting older I'm trying to save my mental energy for stuff that matters.
* Stop cross-posting to Twitter.

Next step: check whether I'm getting any significant traffic from Twitter. The results are dismal -- Twitter referrals are not even 0.1% of the traffic, and I'm getting approximately as many referrals from Wikipedia (for unknown reasons; I never posted anything there).

The final decision was easy: stop cross-posting to Twitter. The bird button at the end of each blog post will remain there, and you can use it to post stuff to Twitter if you wish. I will keep posting to LinkedIn (so you can follow me there), or you could decide to try out the ancient technology called RSS.

Last but definitely not least: it would be a fun summer project to write a script that would email you the short summaries of last week's posts each Saturday, but I have no idea whether anyone would be interested in that. Please write a comment (or send me an email) and let me know whether that's something you'd be interested in.
