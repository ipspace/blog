[RFC 9386](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9386.html) documenting IPv6 deployment status in late 2022 has been published a few weeks ago[^TLT]. It claims over a billion IPv6-capable users, and IPv6 deployment close to 50% in major countries.

Web content is a different story: while 40% of top-500 sites are IPv6-enabled, you can reach only ~20% of web sites over IPv6. Considering Cloudflare's free proxying includes IPv6 that proves (once again) how slowly things change in IT.

[^TLT]: Believe it or not, it takes IETF six months to publish a "snapshot of statistics" document. Even more incredible, the first draft of that document was published in October 2020.
