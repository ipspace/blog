Sometime last autumn, I was asked to create a short "network security challenges" presentation. Eventually, I turned it into a webinar, resulting in almost four hours of content describing the interesting gotchas I encountered in the past (plus a few recent vulnerabilities like [turning WiFi into a thick yellow cable](/2023/04/wifi-shared-medium.html)).

Each webinar section started with a short "This is why we have to deal with these stupidities" introduction. You'll find all of them collected in the [Root Causes](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/NS1%20-%20Root%20Causes.mp4?doccode=Net101) video starting the [Network Security Fallacies](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Net101#NETSEC) part of the [How Networks Really Work](https://www.ipspace.net/How_Networks_Really_Work) webinar.
