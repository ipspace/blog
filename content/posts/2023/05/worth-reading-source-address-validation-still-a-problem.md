I mentioned IP source address validation (SAV) as one of the [MANRS-recommended actions](https://www.manrs.org/netops/network-operator-actions/) in the [Internet Routing Security](https://www.ipspace.net/Internet_Routing_Security) webinar but did not go into any details (as the webinar deals with *routing* security, not *data-plane* security)... but I stumbled upon a wonderful companion article published by RIPE Labs: [Why Is Source Address Validation Still a Problem?](https://labs.ripe.net/author/qasim-lone/sav-why-is-source-address-validation-still-a-problem/).

The article goes through the basics of SAV, best practices, and (most interesting) using free testing tools to detect non-compliant networks. Definitely worth reading!
