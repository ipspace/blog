Wouldn't it be nice if your home router (CPE) could use DSL (or slow-speed fibre) and LTE connection _at the same time_? Even better: run a _single TCP session_ over both links? The answer to both questions is YES, of course it could do that, if only your service provider would be interested in giving you that option.

We solved similar problems with multilink PPP in the networking antiquity, today you could use a CPE with an MP-TCP proxy combined with a Hybrid Access Gateway in the service provider network. For more details, read the excellent [Increasing broadband reach with Hybrid Access Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04570) article by prof. Olivier Bonaventure and his team.
