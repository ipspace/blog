Brian Carpenter published a list of [Multipath TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_TCP) resources to one of the IETF mailing lists[^RM]:

* [Modern Multipath Transport Protocols](https://obonaventure.github.io/mmtp-book/) -- an ebook by prof. Olivier Bonaventure describing QUIC, multipath TCP and multipath QUIC.
* [Multipath TCP Wiki](https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp_net-next/wiki)
* [Multipath TCP for Linux](https://www.mptcp.dev/)
* [Multipath TCP Python extension module](https://pypi.org/project/mptcplib/0.1.2/)

You might also want to listen to the [Multipath TCP](https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/03/multipath-tcp-on-software-gone-wild.html) podcast we recorded with Apple engineers in 2019.

[^RM]: ... along with a nice reminder that "_it might be wise to look at actual implementations of MPTCP before jumping to conclusions_". Yeah, that's never a bad advice, but rarely followed.
