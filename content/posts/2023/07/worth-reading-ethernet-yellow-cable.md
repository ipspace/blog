Since you love to [make comparisons to the good ol' thick yellow cable](https://blog.ipspace.net/2023/04/wifi-shared-medium.html) while I as a mid-30 year old adult have no idea what you are talking about: Computerphile [made a video about Ethernet on the occasion of its 50th birthday](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkOVgkcrvbg). The university of Nottingham got the chance to show their museum pieces :-) (about 8:45 min).
