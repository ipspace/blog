Since you love to [make comparisons to the good ol' thick yellow cable](/2023/04/wifi-shared-medium.html) while I as a mid-30 year old adult have no idea what you are talking about: Computerphile [made a video about Ethernet on the occasion of its 50th birthday](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkOVgkcrvbg).
