My good friend [Tiziano Tofoni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiziano-tofoni-1361759) finally created an English version of his evergreen classic [BGP from theory to practice](https://book.reissromoli.com/product/bgp-from-theory-to-practice/) with co-authors Antonio Prado and Flavio Luciani.

I had the Italian version of the book since the days I was running SDN workshops with Tiziano in Rome, and it's really nice to see they finally decided to address a wider market.

Also, you know what would go well with that book? [Free open-source BGP configuration labs](https://bgplabs.net/) of courseÂ ðŸ˜‰
