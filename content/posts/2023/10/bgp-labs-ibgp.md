After [going through the BGP basics](https://bgplabs.net/#setting-up-bgp), it's time to [build a network that has more than one BGP router in it](https://bgplabs.net/ibgp/1-edge/), starting with the simplest possible topology: a site with two WAN edge routers.

You SHOULD use IBGP to get that done, but there are a few gotchas along the way (I'm positive seasoned networking engineers can immediately figure out at least a couple of them). Instead of writing down a step-by-step recipe, I decided to guide the students through things that ~~can~~ will go wrong, hoping that might help them when they get stuck deploying IBGP in real life.
