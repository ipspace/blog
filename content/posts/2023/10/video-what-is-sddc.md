A few years ago, I was asked to deliver a *What Is SDDC* presentation that later became a webinar. I forgot about that webinar until I received feedback from one of the viewers a week ago:

> If you like to learn from the teachers with the "straight to the point" approach and complement the theory with many "real-life" scenarios, then [ipSpace.net](http://ipspace.net/) is the right place for you.

I haven't realized people still find that webinar useful, so let's [make it viewable without registration](/2023/08/videos-free-subscription/), starting with _[What Problem Are We Trying to Solve](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/SDDC101/1%20-%20What%20Problem%20Are%20We%20Trying%20to%20Solve.mp4?doccode=SDDC101)_ and _[What Is SDDC](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/SDDC101/2%20-%20What%20Is%20SDDC.mp4?doccode=SDDC101)_.

{{<note free>}}You need at least [free ipSpace.net subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free) to watch videos in this webinar.{{</note>}}
