In the [BGP Route Aggregation lab](https://ipspace.github.io/bgplab/basic/8-aggregate/) you can practice:

* OSPF-to-BGP route redistribution
* BGP route aggregation
* Suppression of more-specific prefixes in the BGP table
* Prefix-based filtering of outbound BGP updates

Note: if you want to keep things simple, [run BGP labs with _netlab_](https://ipspace.github.io/bgplab/1-setup/) ([other options](https://ipspace.github.io/bgplab/external/)).
