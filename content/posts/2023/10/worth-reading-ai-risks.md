Bruce Schneier wrote a thoughtful article on the [various perceptions of AI Risks](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/10/ai-risks.html) including this gem:

> As the science-fiction author Ted Chiang has said, fears about the existential risks of AI are really fears about the threat of uncontrolled capitalism, and dystopias like the paper clip maximizer are just caricatures of every start-upâ€™s business plan.

Enjoy!
