I encountered several articles explaining the challenges of simulating your network in a virtual lab in the last few months, including:

* [Some thoughts on digital twins](https://subnetzero.info/2023/08/07/some-thoughts-on-digital-twins/) by Jeff McLaughlin
* Network Simulation is hard -- [Part 1](https://blog.petecrocker.com/post/simulation_is_hard_pt1/), [Part 2](https://blog.petecrocker.com/post/simulation_is_hard_pt2/) -- by Pete Crocker
* [Twenty-five open-source network emulators and simulators you can use in 2023](https://www.brianlinkletter.com/2023/02/network-emulators-and-network-simulators-2023/) by Brian Linkletter

Enjoy!
