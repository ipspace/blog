In the previous lab, you learned how to use [BGP Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED)](https://bgplabs.net/policy/6-med/) to influence incoming traffic flow. Unfortunately, MED works only with parallel links to the same network. In a typical *Redundant Internet Connectivity* scenario, you want to have links to two ISPs, so you need a bigger hammer: [AS Path Prepending](https://bgplabs.net/policy/7-prepend/).
