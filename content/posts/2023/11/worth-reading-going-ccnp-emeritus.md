Daniel Teycheney decided not to renew his CCNP status and used this opportunity to publish [his thoughts on IT certifications](https://blog.danielteycheney.com/posts/im-going-ccnp-emeritus/). Not surprisingly, I agree with most of the things he said, but I never put it in writing so succinctly.

**Red Pill Warning:** Reading his blog post might damage your rosy view of the networking industry. You've been warned ;)
