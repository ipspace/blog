Tomas [wants to start _netlab_ with PowerShell](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab/issues/957), but it doesn't work for him, and I don't know anyone running _netlab_ directly on Windows (I know people running it in a Ubuntu VM on Windows, but that's a different story).

In theory, _netlab_ (and Ansible) should work fine with Windows Subsystem for Linux. In practice, there's often a gap between theory and practice -- if you run _netlab_ on Windows (probably using VirtualBox with Vagrant), I'd love to hear from you. Please leave a comment, email me, add a comment to [Tomas' GitHub issue](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab/issues/957), or [fix the documentation](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab/blob/dev/docs/labs/virtualbox.md) and [submit a PR](https://netlab.tools/dev/guidelines/). Thank you!
