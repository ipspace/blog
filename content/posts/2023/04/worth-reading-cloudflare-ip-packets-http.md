Want to know some details behind the CloudFlare SD-WAN implementation? You might find them in _[From IP packets to HTTP: the many faces of our Oxy framework](https://blog.cloudflare.com/from-ip-packets-to-http-the-many-faces-of-our-oxy-framework/)_.

I don't know enough about Linux networking to figure out whether one could use those details to build something similar, but CloudFlare blog posts keep begin much better than Google's [Look How Awesome We Are](/2020/11/worth-reading-ai-replication-self-promotion/) recruitment drives.
