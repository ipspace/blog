While I was developing [Network Automation Concepts](https://www.ipspace.net/Network_Automation_Concepts) webinar and the [network automation online course](https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions), I wrote numerous blog posts on the Network Infrastructure as Code (NIaC) concepts, challenges, implementation details, tools, and sample solutions. 

In March 2023 I [collected these blog posts into a dedicated *NIaC resources* page](/series/niac.html) that also includes links to webinars,  sample network automation solutions, and relevant GitHub repositories.
