Bruce Davie continues documenting the tradeoffs we had to make in networking, this time with _[Was MPLS Traffic Engineering Worthwhile?](https://systemsapproach.substack.com/p/was-mpls-traffic-engineering-worthwhile)_ I found this bit particularly familiar:

> It wasn’t hard to make a theoretical argument that MPLS-TE could improve network performance and average link utilization, by moving traffic from congested links to uncongested ones. The hard part was proving that it would actually do a better job in practice than the more traditional methods such as using link weights and multipath routing to achieve the same ends.
