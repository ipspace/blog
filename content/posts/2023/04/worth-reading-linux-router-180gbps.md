Pim van Pelt built an x86/Linux-based using Vector Packet Processor that can forwarding IP traffic at 150 Mpps/180 Gbps forwarding rates on a 2-CPU Dell server with E5-2660 (8 core) CPU. 

He described the whole thing in a [8-part series of blog posts](https://ipng.ch/s/articles/2023/04/09/vpp-stats.html) and [a conference talk](https://video.ipng.ch/w/erc9sAofrSZ22qjPwmv6H4). Enjoy!
