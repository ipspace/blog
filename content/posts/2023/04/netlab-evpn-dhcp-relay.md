After [figuring out how DHCP relaying works](/2023/03/dhcp-relay-process.html) and testing it with[ VRFs](/2023/03/netlab-vrf-dhcp-relay.html) and in [VXLAN segments](/2023/03/netlab-vxlan-dhcp-relay.html), it seems like a no-brainer to make it work with EVPN.

**TL&DR:** It works, at least when using Arista vEOS as the relay and Cisco CSR 1000v as the DHCP server.

### Lab Topology

We'll keep using the exact same "physical" topology we used in the [VXLAN DHCP relaying](/2023/03/netlab-vxlan-dhcp-relay.html) lab, add EVPN and BGP to the control-plane cocktail, and put the VXLAN segment into a VRF. We'll use CSR 1000v as the DHCP server because Cisco IOSv doesn't support some of the DHCP option-82 sub-options we need.

### Device Configurations

I configured VRF-aware DHCP relay (**ip dhcp relay information option**) on both switches. The DHCP pools on the DHCP server are not VRF-aware due to the Arista EOS bug (misformed sub-option 151). The [final device configurations](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/tree/master/DHCP/evpn-relay/config) are available in [netlab-examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples).

### Does It Work?

Of course, I didn't expect anything else based on previous test cases. The exchange of DHCP packets is easy to reconstruct from the logs ([client](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/blob/master/DHCP/evpn-relay/config/cl_a.log), [server](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/blob/master/DHCP/evpn-relay/config/srv.log)). As before:

* DHCP client sends a DHCP DISCOVER local broadcast
* The directly connected switch forwards the DHCP request to the DHCP server. The source IP address of the relayed packet, and the **giaddr** (gateway IP address) in the forwarded DHCP request is the IP address of the outgoing interface (in the global IP routing table).[^LB] The switch also forwards the broadcast Ethernet packet across the VXLAN segment.
* The second switch receives the VXLAN-encapsulated DHCP request broadcast and forwards the second copy of the same packet to the DHCP server.
* DHCP server receives two copies of the DHCP DISCOVER request but replies with a single DHCP OFFER packet to the first DHCP REQUEST packet it received.
* The DHCP server IP address in the DHCP OFFER packet is the relaying switch VRF IP address specified in the **server-id-override** sub-option.

[^LB]: Or an IP address of an interface specified in **ip helper address** command. On Arista switches, it might be a good idea to use the global loopback interface as the source interface of the forwarded DHCP request.

{{<note info>}}As the DHCP request from the directly-connected switch usually arrives before the other copy that took the scenic VXLAN route, the DHCP server IP address in the DHCP OFFER packet is usually (but not necessarily) the VRF IP address of the switch to which the client is directly connected.
{{</note>}}

* The DHCP OFFER packet is sent to the selected relay's **giaddr** (global IP address)
* The switch receiving the DHCP OFFER forwards the offer to the DHCP client. The DHCP client thinks the DHCP server IP address is the DHCP relay VRF IP address. Not surprisingly, Client-A uses SW-1 as the DHCP server, and Client-B uses SW-2 as the DHCP server:

```

* The DHCP client sends a DHCP REQUEST packet as a local broadcast (it still doesn't have a confirmed IP address). The DHCP server IP address in the DHCP REQUEST packet is the VRF IP address of the switch that relayed the DHCP OFFER packet.
* Both switches receive the DHCP REQUEST broadcast and relay it to the DHCP server.
* The DHCP server receives two DHCP REQUEST packets and sends two DHCP ACK messages with the DHCP server IP address set to the relay VRF IP address.

{{<note warn>}}Reading Section 4 of [RFC 5107](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5107.html), it looks like the DHCP server should drop the incoming DHCP REQUEST packet if the server identifier does not match one of its IP addresses nor the **server-id-override** sub-option. Cisco IOS XE DHCP server definitely doesn't care about this intricate detail and happily answers both requests.{{</note>}} 

* DHCP client receives a DHCP ACK message from the server it sent the request to, but also a second DHCP ACK message from an unknown server. It ignores the second one.

**Takeaways:**

* The DHCP client thinks one of the directly-connected switches is the DHCP server. That's the only way to get a DHCP request across VRF boundary.
* When using Arista EOS as the DHCP relay, the DHCP server IP address used by the client is the unicast (not anycast) IPv4 address of the switch.
* Different clients could be using different switches as their "DHCP servers".
* If the unicast IPv4 address of the relaying switch disappears, the client loses its path to the DHCP server, and cannot extend its lease, but the rebinding process (section 4.4.5 of [RFC 2131](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2131)) should take care of that. With the default settings, the rebinding process starts before 90% of the lease time expires which should be more than enough.

Apart from the minor details listed above, it all looks like a walk in the park, right? It is, and it should work with any DHCP server and any decently-implemented data center switch... as long as you're using a single DHCP server. More about this juicy detail in the last blog post in this series.

### Try It Out!

Want to run this lab on your own, or try it out with different devices? No problem:

* Make sure your preferred device supports inter-VRF DHCP relaying, VXLANs and EVPN.
* [Install netlab](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
* [Download the relevant containers](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/labs/clab.html) or [create Vagrant boxes](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/labs/libvirt.html)
* Download the [EVPN VRF DHCP relaying example](https://github.com/ipspace/netlab-examples/tree/master/DHCP/evpn-relay) into an empty directory
* If you want to use a relaying device that's not Arista EOS, add a configuration template to `dhcp-relay` subdirectory.
* Execute **netlab up**
* Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š

### Coming Up Next

We had a smooth journey so far (apart from an unknown Arista EOS  developer failing to read the RFC 6607), but we're about to hit a minor hurdle: what happens if we want to have redundant DHCP servers? Stay tuned...{{</next-in-series>}}
