I [always said](/tag/certifications/) that the [Trivia Pursuit certification tests ](/2020/09/worth-reading-iron-chef-certification-edition/)(or job interviews) are nonsense and that one [should focus on fundamentals](/2015/03/you-must-understand-fundamentals-to-be/).

In a recent blog post, Daniel Dib [described a fantastic scenario](https://lostintransit.se/2023/12/06/how-to-interview-a-network-engineer-using-a-single-scenario/): using a simple "_why can't I connect to a web site_" question, explore everything from ARP/ND to DNS and TLS.

Obviously, you'll never see anything that sane in a certification test. An interactive interview doesn't scale (beyond CCDE), and using humans (and common sense judgment) creates potential legal liabilities (there were rumors that had been one of the reasons a talk with a proctor who could flunk you was dropped from the CCIE test).
