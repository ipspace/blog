A [previous BGP lab](https://bgplabs.net/policy/8-community-attach/) focused on the customer side of BGP communities: adding them to BGP updates to influence upstream ISP behavior. [Today's lab](https://bgplabs.net/policy/9-community-use/) focuses on the ISP side of the equation: using BGP communities in a routing policy to implement [RFC 1998-style behavior](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1998.html).

With this lab exercise, I [completed the original BGP labs project](/2023/08/bgp-hands-on-labs/) -- all the labs I had in the BGP course I created in the mid-1990s are now [available online](https://bgplabs.net/) free of charge on [more than a dozen](https://netlab.tools/platforms/#platform-routing-support) different network operating systems. Now, you have absolutely no excuse not to become a BGP master ;))
