Eric Hoel published a [spot-on analysis of AI disruptiveness](https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/excuse-me-but-the-industries-ai-is), including this gem:

> The easier it is to train an AI to do something, the less economically valuable that thing is. After all, the huge supply of the thing is how the AI got so good in the first place.

**TL&DR**: AI can easily disrupt things that are easy to generate and thus have little value. Seeing investors trying to recoup the billions pouring into the latest fad will be fun.
