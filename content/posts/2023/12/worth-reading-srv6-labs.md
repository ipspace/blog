Want to explore SRv6? Cisco engineers put together a 
[repository containing scripts and configs for building SRv6 test topologies](https://github.com/segmentrouting/srv6-labs). It works with Containerlab and FRR (unless you want to beg a Cisco account team for a Cisco 8000 image or make a sandwich while the IOS XRd image is booting).

Want to use _netlab_? [Jeroen van Bemmel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroenvbemmel/) implemented [baseline SRv6 support](https://netlab.tools/module/srv6/) for Nokia SR OS.
