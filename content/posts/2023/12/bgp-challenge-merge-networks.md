Here's a challenge in case you get bored during the Christmas break: [merge two networks running BGP](https://bgplabs.net/challenge/20-merge-as/) (two autonomous systems) without changing anything but the configurations of the routers connecting them (the red BGP session in the diagram). I won't give you any hints; you can discuss it in the comments or a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/bgplab/bgplab/discussions/2).

Hopefully, you won't have to deal with something similar in real life, but then we know that crazy requirements trump good designs any day of the week.
