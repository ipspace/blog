One of my readers asked for my opinion about the following masterpiece posted on (where else) LinkedIn[^RI]:

I would usually call it "a Bullshit Bingo Winner" but fortunately Tom Hollingsworth expanded my vocabulary with "[argument farming](https://networkingnerd.net/2023/08/11/argument-farming/)" or in this case attention/engagement farming. I can see no other reason why someone would post something so meaningless and full of buzzwords.

Fortunately all is not lost. It's still possible to find an occasional interesting tidbit on LinkedIn like [this discussion of sources of network complexity](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/miancu_is-computer-networking-too-complex-activity-7095747933735702528-YXQ2) -- not that I would fully agree with the author or comments/counterarguments, but they had something to say, and there was some obvious mental effort going into it.

[^RI]: There's a reason behind posting it as an image and omitting the author's name.
