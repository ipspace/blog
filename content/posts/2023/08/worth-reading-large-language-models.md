Bruce Davie published an [interesting overview article about 
Large Language Models](https://systemsapproach.substack.com/p/looking-inside-large-language-models). It would be worth reading just for the copious links to in-depth article; I particularly like his conclusions:

> We mistake performance (producing realistic text) for competence (understanding the world).

> Having a model for language is different from having a model of the world.

And that's a perfect explanation why it makes no sense to expect ChatGPT and friends to produce [picture-perfect device configurations](/2023/04/chatgpt-small-network-design.html) or [always-working code](/2023/04/kicking-tires-github-copilot.html).
