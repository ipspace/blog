More than a dozen years after the [SDN brouhaha erupted](https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/03/open-networking-foundation-fabric.html), some people still haven't got the memo on the obsolescence of CLI. For example, Julia Evans [tries to make people comfortable with the command line](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/08/08/what-helps-people-get-comfortable-on-the-command-line-/). Has nobody told her it's like teaching COBOL?

On a more serious note: you [OUGHT TO](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6919#section-4) master Linux CLI and be comfortable using CLI commands on network devices _and_ servers. Her article has tons of useful tips and is definitely worth reading.
