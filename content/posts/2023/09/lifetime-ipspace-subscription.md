More than thirteen years after I started creating vendor-neutral webinars, it's time for another change[^NL]: the ipSpace.net subscriptions became perpetual. If you have an active ipSpace.net subscription, it will stay valid indefinitely[^SD] (and I'll stop nagging you with renewal notices).

[^SD]: In reality: until AWS shuts down my servers due to an expired credit card. Don't expect that to happen anytime soon, though.

### Wow, Free Lunch?

Sadly, that's not the case.
<!--more-->
I will gradually stop creating new webinars, and making the subscriptions perpetual was the only fair way to ensure the subscribers get what they paid for. The webinars I promised for autumn 2023 will definitely happen but later than expected, and I might keep extending the networking fundamentals materials. Beyond that, the crystal ball is hazy.

### What Will Happen With

-   **Online courses**: You can no longer buy them (nor the Expert Subscription), but I will keep supporting you if you bought them in the past.
-   **ipSpace.net blog**: I will keep ranting and writing about exciting tools and technologies (what else did you expect?), but probably not every day.
-   **netlab** software: no change. That's one of the beauties of free and open-source software -- keep sending the PRs and the software will keep evolving. On a more serious note, I'll keep adding features and fixing bugs, and I have a few projects in mind relying on it, so it's not going anywhere.

### But I Would Love to Get Access to Your Materials

No worries. You can still buy the [Standard subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/) until January 1st 2024. At that time I'll set the expiration date of your subscription to January 1st, 2100[^ETW]. If both of us are still around after the modified expiration date, email me, and I'll extend it further.

[^ETW]: It's easier doing it that way than changing the back-end software. Call me lazy if you wish ;)

### Hey, What's Going On?

Glad you asked (or at least got this far). I'm going through creative burnout, and making new stuff (even as simple as turning email replies into blog posts) is becoming harder and harder. Slowing down and hoping for an eventual recharge of the creative batteries is the only way forward I could find.
