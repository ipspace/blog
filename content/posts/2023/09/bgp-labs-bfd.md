In the next [BGP labs](https://bgplabs.net/) exercise you can practice [tweaking BGP timers and using BFD to speed up BGP convergence](https://bgplabs.net/basic/7-bfd/).

{{<figure src="https://bgplabs.net/basic/topology-bfd.png">}}

I would strongly recommend using _netlab_ to [run BGP labs](https://bgplabs.net/1-setup/), but if you insist you can use [any system you like including physical hardware](https://bgplabs.net/external/).
