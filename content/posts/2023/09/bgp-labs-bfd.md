In the next [BGP labs](https://bgplab.github.io/bgplab/) exercise you can practice [tweaking BGP timers and using BFD to speed up BGP convergence](https://bgplab.github.io/bgplab/basic/7-bfd/).

I would strongly recommend using _netlab_ to [run BGP labs](https://bgplab.github.io/bgplab/1-setup/), but if you insist you can use [any system you like including physical hardware](https://bgplab.github.io/bgplab/external/).
