Talking about BGP routing policy mechanisms is nice, but it's even better to see how real Internet Service Providers use those tools to implement real-life BGP routing policy.

Getting that information is incredibly hard as everyone considers their setup a secret sauce. Fortunately, there are a few exceptions; [Pim van Pelt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pim-van-pelt-474466263/) described the [BGP Routing Policy of IPng Networks](https://ipng.ch/s/articles/2021/11/14/routing-policy.html) in great details. The article is even more interesting as he's using Bird2 configuration language that looks almost like a programming language (as compared to the ancient **route-maps** used by vendors focused on "industry-standard" CLI).

Have fun!
