Dip Singh published an excellent [primer on communication fundamentals](https://dipsingh.github.io/Back-to-basics-communication/) including:

* Waves: frequency, amplitude, wavelength, phase
* Composite signals, frequency domain and Fourier transform
* Bandwidth, fundamental and harmonic frequency
* Decibels in a nutshell
* Transmission impairments: attenuation, distortion, noise
* Principles of modern communications: Nyquist theorem, Shannon's law, bit and baud rate
* Line encoding techniques, quadrature methods (including QPSK and QAM)

Even if you don't care about layer-1 technologies you MUST read it to get at least a basic appreciation of why stuff you're using to read this blog post works.
