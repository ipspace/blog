An anonymous commenter [asked this highly relevant question](https://blog.ipspace.net/2023/06/bgp-leak-lab.html#1859) about my [Internet routing security lab](/2023/06/bgp-leak-lab.html):

> What are the smallest hardware requirements to run the lab.

**TL&DR:** 2 GB RAM, 2 vCPU

Now for the more precise answer (aka "*it depends*").
<!--more-->
The lab has nine routers. Each device needs between 256MB (Mikrotik) and 8GB (Cisco IOS XR) if you run them as virtual machines[^MD]. Add 2 GB for the host operating system and the virtualization environment[^LT], and we're quickly getting into the 8GB -- 16 GB ballpark. Also, you should expect every network device to use at least half a CPU core[^ST].

[^MD]: For more details, check out the *netlab* [Supported Platforms](https://netlab.tools/platforms/) page.

[^LT]: Way more if you want to run the lab on your laptop: my Mac consumes 4GB while doing nothing.

[^ST]: Way more during the startup phase, but once the devices reach a steady state there's no reason they should burn more CPU cycles... which obviously doesn't mean some of them won't. Cisco CSR1000v and Juniper vSRX are probably the worst offenders -- they burn a CPU core constantly checking whether there are any packets to be forwarded.

Fortunately there's another way: Linux containers. Instead of a full-blown virtual machine, every network device gets another copy of the Linux TCP/IP stack and becomes just a set of isolated processes running on top of a shared Linux kernel. There are four easy-to-get network-device-as-container implementations supported by _netlab_: Arista EOS, Cumulus Linux, FRR, and Nokia SR-Linux.

I ran the BGP lab with all four of them and got the following printouts from the **free** command after the lab was started and configured. The relevant column is the **used** column where you should subtract 1GB (the idle system memory utilization) to get the memory consumed by the lab containers.

As you can see, you can choose between two lightweight implementations (Cumulus and FRR) and two heavy hitters (Arista cEOS and Nokia SR Linux). Needless to say, Arista and Nokia have much better configuration capabilities and support more features than Cumulus or FRR, but that doesn't matter if you're interested in BGP routing and some simple ingress/egress filters.

It would be an interesting exercise to try to run network device containers and *containerlab* on Windows or MacOS laptop, but you don't have to: [create a Ubuntu VM with 2GB or 4GB of RAM](https://netlab.tools/install/ubuntu-vm/) and a few virtual CPU cores, [install *netlab*](https://netlab.tools/install/ubuntu/) and [*containerlab*](https://netlab.tools/labs/clab/) on it, and you're good to go.
