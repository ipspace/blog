Stefano Sasso added two new Junos platforms in _netlab_ [release 1.5.4](https://netlab.tools/release/1.5/#release-1-5-4):

* vJunos Evolved (vPTX) -- a new [VM-based product](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/vJunosEvolved/vJunosEvolved-kvm-deployment-guide/vJunosEvolved-KVM/topics/vJunos-Evolved-architecture.html) Juniper released a few weeks ago
* vSRX running as a *vrnetlab*-packaged container.

There are also the [usual bug fixes](https://netlab.tools/release/1.5/#bug-fixes-in-release-1-5-4), and we moved the documentation to [netlab.tools](https://netlab.tools/).
