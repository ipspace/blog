Long story short: it's time for another summer break, as people reporting my bloopers -- THANK YOU!!! -- know only too well. I plan to be back in early autumn rolling out [tons of new content](https://www.ipspace.net/Webinars/Sessions). 

I'll do my best to reply to support requests (it will take longer than usual), and probably won't be able to resist publishing a few lightweight _netlab_-related blog posts. If you get bored there's still [over 400 hours of existing content](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual), [over 100 podcast episodes](https://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild/), and [thousands of blog posts](https://blog.ipspace.net/).

In the meantime, get away from work, turn off the Internet, and enjoy a few days in your favorite spot with your loved ones!
