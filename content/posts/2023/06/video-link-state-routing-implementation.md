After [introducing the routing protocols](https://blog.ipspace.net/2022/11/video-routing-protocols-overview.html) and explaining the [basics of link-state routing](https://blog.ipspace.net/2023/02/video-link-state-routing-basics.html) it was time for [implementation considerations](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Net101/RP2.2%20-%20Link%20State%20Routing%20Protocol%20Implementation%20Considerations.mp4?doccode=Net101) including:

* Collecting local endpoint reachability information
* Finding neighbors and exchanging the collected information (hint: a link-state topology database is just a distributed key-value store)
* Running the SPF algorithm (including partial SPF details) and installing the results
