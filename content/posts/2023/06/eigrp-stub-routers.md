Years ago I wrote an article describing how EIGRP stub routers work and how you should use them in redundant remote sites to make sure link- or node failures don't result in partial connectivity. That article is now [available on ipSpace.net](/kb/Internet/EIGRP_stub); I hope at least someone will find it useful. I know it's about ancient technology, but then people are still running COBOL on mainframes.
