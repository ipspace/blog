EIGRP routing updates have always contained the *next hop* field (similar to BGP updates), which was unused until Cisco IOS release 12.3 when the **no ip next-hop-self eigrp _AS-number_** interface configuration command was implemented.

EIGRP does not set the *next hop* field by default. An EIGRP router receiving a routing update thus assumes that the next hop of the received routes is the sending router. This behavior usually works well, but prevents site-to-site shortcuts to be established in DMVPN networks, and results in suboptimal routing in some route redistribution scenarios.

{{<ct3_rescue noyear="true">}}

With the **no ip next-hop-self eigrp** command configured on an interface, an EIGRP router will set the *next hop* field in outgoing routing updates if the IP next hop in its EIGRP topology table belongs to the IP subnet of the outgoing interface. The *next hop* field is set in internal as well as external EIGRP routing updates, optimizing traffic flow in route redistribution scenarios.

## NBMA Network with Default EIGRP Next-Hop Processing

The default EIGRP next hop processing will be illustrated in a simple NBMA network with three routers. R1 is the hub router; R2 and R3 are spoke routers. The examples use Frame Relay network between them; it could also be a DMVPN Phase-1 network or a Carrier Ethernet service.

{{<figure src="NH_NBMA_Diagram.png" caption="NBMA network diagram">}}

EIGRP split horizon has been disabled on R1 to allow route propagation between R2 and R3. The relevant parts of the R1’s router configuration are included in the following printout: 

{{<cc>}}Disabling EIGRP split horizon on the hub router{{</cc>}}
```
interface Serial1/0
 description Link to FR
 ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
 encapsulation frame-relay
 no ip split-horizon eigrp 1
 frame-relay lmi-type ansi
```

By default, R1 does not set the *next hop* field in outgoing EIGRP routing update:

{{<figure src="NH_Self_Wireshark.png" caption="EIGRP does not set the next-hop field by default">}}

After the EIGRP adjacencies are established, the routing table on R3 contains routes to loopback interfaces of R1 and R2. The *next-hop* field in the EIGRP updates sent by R1 was empty; the next hop of both routes in the R3’s routing table is thus R1.

{{<cc>}}Routing table on R3{{</cc>}}
```
R3#show ip route | begin Gateway
Gateway of last resort is not set

     10.0.0.0/8 is variably subnetted, 5 subnets, 2 masks
C       10.0.1.3/32 is directly connected, Loopback0
S       10.0.0.2/32 [1/0] via 10.0.0.1
D       10.0.1.2/32 [90/2809856] via 10.0.0.1, 00:05:37, Serial1/0
D       10.0.1.1/32 [90/2297856] via 10.0.0.1, 00:05:37, Serial1/0
C       10.0.0.0/24 is directly connected, Serial1/0
```

The EIGRP topology table printout displays the EIGRP vector metric and next hop details. As expected, the bandwidth of both routes is the same, but the delay and the hop-count of R2’s loopback interface have been increased as the routing update has passed through R1.

```

## NBMA Network with Disabled EIGRP next-hop-self

EIGRP next hop calculations are enabled with the **no ip next-hop-self eigrp _as_** interface configuration command. After the WAN interface configuration on R1 has been modified (see the following printout)...

{{<cc>}}Modified EIGRP interface configuration on R1{{</cc>}}
```
interface Serial1/0
 description Link to FR
 ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
 no ip next-hop-self eigrp 1
 encapsulation frame-relay
 no ip split-horizon eigrp 1
 frame-relay lmi-type ansi
```

... R1 inserts the *next-hop* IP address in outgoing EIGRP routing updates if the next hop's IP address in its EIGRP topology table belongs to the IP subnet of the outgoing interface.

{{<note warn>}}Changing the EIGRP next hop processing on an interface clears all EIGRP adjacencies on that interface.{{</note>}}

A sample EIGRP update packet sent from R1 to R3 is displayed in the next figure:

{{<figure src="NH_Set_Wireshark.png" caption="EIGRP update has non-zero next hop field">}}

After the EIGRP adjacencies between R1 and R2/R3 are reestablished, the next-hop IP address of R2’s loopback interface in R3’s IP routing table is the WAN address of R2 (not R1):

{{<cc>}}Modified IP routing table on R3{{</cc>}}
```
R3#show ip route | begin Gateway
Gateway of last resort is not set

     10.0.0.0/8 is variably subnetted, 5 subnets, 2 masks
C       10.0.1.3/32 is directly connected, Loopback0
S       10.0.0.2/32 [1/0] via 10.0.0.1
D       10.0.1.2/32 [90/2809856] via 10.0.0.2, 00:09:38, Serial1/0
D       10.0.1.1/32 [90/2297856] via 10.0.0.1, 00:09:40, Serial1/0
C       10.0.0.0/24 is directly connected, Serial1/0
```

The modified next hop value is also displayed in the **show ip eigrp topology** printout, which indicates that the routing update has been received from R1 (10.0.0.1), but the *next-hop* field in the received update contains the IP address of R2 (10.0.0.2). The *delay* component of the vector metric and the *hop count* field have been increased (as compared to the EIGRP route toward R1’s loopback interface) when R1 has propagated the routing update between R2 and R3.

{{<note warn>}}The increase in EIGRP *delay* component could cause suboptimal routing in DMVPN networks with backdoor links.{{</note>}}

```

Please note that it makes sense to use third-party next hops only when the routers can communicate with each other but cannot exchange routing updates. DMVPN Phase 2 networks are a typical example.

## EIGRP Next Hop Processing in Route Redistribution Scenarios

The **no ip next-hop-self eigrp** interface configuration command affects internal and external EIGRP routes. This effect is easy to demonstrate in a sample three router network running two EIGRP processes (Figure 4).

{{<figure src="NH_Redistribute_Diagram.png" caption="EIGRP redistribution test lab">}}

The relevant configuration commands of the GW router are shown in the next printout:

{{<cc>}}EIGRP configuration on the GW router{{</cc>}}
```
interface FastEthernet0/0
 ip address 10.0.2.2 255.255.255.0
!
router eigrp 1
 redistribute eigrp 2
 network 0.0.0.0
 auto-summary
!
router eigrp 2
 redistribute eigrp 1
 network 0.0.0.0
 auto-summary
```

AS1 and AS2 belong to two different EIGRP processes; the **no ip split-horizon eigrp** interface configuration command is therefore not needed.

IP routing table on the GW router contains EIGRP routes from AS1 and AS2 with correct IP next hops.

```
GW#show ip route | begin Gateway
Gateway of last resort is not set

     10.0.0.0/8 is variably subnetted, 4 subnets, 2 masks
C       10.0.2.0/24 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/0
D       10.0.1.3/32 [90/156160] via 10.0.2.3, 00:01:30, FastEthernet0/0
C       10.0.1.2/32 is directly connected, Loopback0
D       10.0.1.1/32 [90/156160] via 10.0.2.1, 00:12:40, FastEthernet0/0
```

The GW router advertises the route to AS1’s loopback address as an external EIGRP route to AS2. With the default EIGRP interface parameters, the *next-hop* field in the EIGRP update packet is empty and all the traffic between AS2 and AS1 flows through the GW router:

{{<cc>}}Routing table on AS2 with simple route redistribution on GW{{</cc>}}
```
AS2#show ip route | begin Gateway
Gateway of last resort is not set

     10.0.0.0/8 is variably subnetted, 4 subnets, 2 masks
C       10.0.2.0/24 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/0
C       10.0.1.3/32 is directly connected, Loopback0
D       10.0.1.2/32 [90/156160] via 10.0.2.2, 00:12:14, FastEthernet0/0
D EX    10.0.1.1/32 [170/158720] via 10.0.2.2, 00:12:11, FastEthernet0/0
```

To optimize the traffic flow between AS1 and AS2 you have to enable the EIGRP next hop calculations with the **no ip next-hop-self eigrp** command on the GW router. The next hop processing has to be enabled for both EIGRP processes:

{{<cc>}}Enabling third-party next hop on redistribution router{{</cc>}}
```
interface FastEthernet0/0
 ip address 10.0.2.2 255.255.255.0
 no ip next-hop-self eigrp 1
 no ip next-hop-self eigrp 2
```

After the **no ip next-hop-self eigrp** command has been configured, the update packets sent from GW to AS2 contain non-zero values in the *next-hop* field:

{{<figure src="NH_Redistribute_Wireshark.png" caption="External EIGRP route with non-zero next-hop field">}}

The next hop for the 10.0.1.1/32 prefix in the IP routing table of AS2 is modified accordingly; the traffic from AS2 to AS1 is sent directly and bypasses the GW router:

{{<cc>}}Modified IP routing table on AS2{{</cc>}}
```
AS2#show ip route | begin Gateway
Gateway of last resort is not set

     10.0.0.0/8 is variably subnetted, 4 subnets, 2 masks
C       10.0.2.0/24 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/0
C       10.0.1.3/32 is directly connected, Loopback0
D       10.0.1.2/32 [90/156160] via 10.0.2.2, 00:12:14, FastEthernet0/0
D EX    10.0.1.1/32 [170/158720] via 10.0.2.1, 00:12:11, FastEthernet0/0
```

The non-zero value of the *next-hop* field is also reflected in the **show ip eigrp topology** printout:

{{<cc>}}Modified EIGRP topology table on AS2{{</cc>}}
```
AS2#show ip eigrp topology 10.0.1.1 255.255.255.255
