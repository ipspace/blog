Did you ever wonder why it's impossible to find good service company, why most software sucks, or why networking vendors can get away with selling crap? If you did, and found no good answer (apart from [Sturgeon's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law)), it's time to read [_Why is it so hard to buy things that work well?_](https://danluu.com/nothing-works/) by [Dan Luu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danluu/).

Totally off-topic: his web site uses almost no CSS and looks in my browser like a relic of 1980s. Suggestions how to fix that (in Chrome) are most welcome.
