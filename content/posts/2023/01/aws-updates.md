It didn't make sense to update *[Amazon Web Services Networking](https://www.ipspace.net/Amazon_Web_Services_Networking)* webinar before the re:Invent conference -- even though AWS introduced only a few networking features during the conference, at least [one of them](https://blog.ipspace.net/2022/12/quick-look-aws-srd.html) made a significant impact on the materials.

However, once the conference was over, I went over the to-do list that has been slowly accumulating for months and spent days updating over a dozen videos[^PM]. The major changes include:

[^PM]: While rediscovering why I never wanted to be a Project Manager ;)

* An overview of IPv6 support in AWS networking services
* IPv6-only VPC subnets and EC2 instances
* Multiple IPv6 CIDR blocks per VPC
* Multiple default gateway router IPv6 addresses
* Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) Express and SRD
* NAT64 in NAT Gateway and DNS64 in Route 53
* Intra-region peering of AWS Transit Gateways
* ALB and NLB minimum healthy targets
* Zonal ALB target groups

You'll find more details in the _[New AWS Services and Features](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/AWSNET/AWS-Update.md?doccode=AWSNET)_ document (you'll need at least the [Free ipSpace.net Subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free) to access it).
