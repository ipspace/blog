One of the last things I did before going on the Christmas break was to push out [netlab release 1.4.2](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release/1.4.html#release-1-4-2). Its highlights include:

- [Juniper vMX](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/platforms.html) by [Stefano Sasso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssasso)
- BFD, VRF, MPLS, SR-MPLS, and MPLS/VPN on Junos (also by Stefano)
- Full VLAN support on vMX and routed VLAN interfaces on vSRX (yet again, Stefano's contribution)
- VyOS containerlab support byÂ [Oleg A. Arkhangelsky](https://github.com/sysoleg)
- CSR 1000v VLAN and VXLAN support

Upgrading is as easy as ever: execute `pip3 install --upgrade networklab`.
