One of the last things I did before going on the Christmas break was to push out [netlab release 1.4.2](https://netlab.tools/release/1.4/#release-1-4-2). Its highlights include:

- [Juniper vMX](https://netlab.tools/platforms/) by [Stefano Sasso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssasso)
- BFD, VRF, MPLS, SR-MPLS, and MPLS/VPN on Junos (also by Stefano)
- Full VLAN support on vMX and routed VLAN interfaces on vSRX (yet again, Stefano's contribution)
- VyOS containerlab support byÂ [Oleg A. Arkhangelsky](https://github.com/sysoleg)
- CSR 1000v VLAN and VXLAN support

Upgrading is as easy as ever: execute `pip3 install --upgrade networklab`.
