I had a lovely chat with [David Gee](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:David_Gee) on his [built.fm podcast](https://built.fm/) sometime in December. David [switched jobs in the meantime](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davedotdev/), and so it took him a bit longer than expected to publish it. Chatting with David is always fun; hope you'll enjoy our chat  as much as I did.
