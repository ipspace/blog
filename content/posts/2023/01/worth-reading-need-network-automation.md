A long, long time ago, [Mircea Ulinic](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Mircea_Ulinic) (the author of Salt networking modules) wrote a long and thoughtful blog post on [whether we need network automation](https://mirceaulinic.net/2019-01-09-do-we-need-network-automation/) (TL&DR spoiler: yes).

After reading the article, you might want to listen to the [Salt and SaltStack](/2017/04/salt-and-saltstack-on-software-gone-wild/) podcast we did with Mircea a long while ago, and [watch his presentation](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutSol&module=8#M8S2) in [Building Network Automation Solutions](https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions) online course (also accessible with [Expert Subscription](https://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Individual)).
