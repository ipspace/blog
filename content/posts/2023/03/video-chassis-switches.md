Did you know that most chassis switches look like leaf-and-spine fabrics[^FC] from the inside? If you didn't, you might want to watch the short [Chassis Architectures](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/DCFabric/AS4%20-%20Chassis%20Architectures.mp4?doccode=DCFabric) video by [Pete Lumbis](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Pete_Lumbis) (author of [ASICs for Networking Engineers](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DCFabric#TECHNOLOGY) part of the [Data Center Fabric Architectures](https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics) webinar).

[^FC]: Ignoring for the moment whether they use cell- or frame-based fabrics, and all the *virtual output queue* details.
