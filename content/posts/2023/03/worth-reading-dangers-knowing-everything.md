Another interesting take on ChatGPT in networking, this time by Tom Hollingsworth in [The Dangers of Knowing Everything](http://networkingnerd.net/2023/03/10/the-dangers-of-knowing-everything/):

> In a way, ChatGPT is like a salesperson. No matter what you ask it the answer is always yes, even if it has to make something up to answer the question. 

To paraphrase an old joke: It's not that ChatGPT is lying. It's just that what it knows isn't necessarily true. See also: [the difference between bullshit and lies](https://www.membrain.com/blog/how-to-smell-the-difference-between-bs-and-a-lie).
