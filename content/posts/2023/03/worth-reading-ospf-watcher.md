Vadim Semenov created an interesting solution out of open-source tools (and some glue): a system that [tracks, logs, and displays OSPF changes in your network](https://github.com/Vadims06/ospfwatcher).

It might not be exactly what you're looking for (and purists would argue [it should use BGP-LS](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/06/ospf-bgp-ls.html)), but that's the beauty of open-source solutions: go and adapt it to your needs, generalizes your fixes, and submit a pull request.
