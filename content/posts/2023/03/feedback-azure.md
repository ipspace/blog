Numerous networking engineers found my [cloud webinars](https://www.ipspace.net/Cloud) ([AWS](https://www.ipspace.net/Amazon_Web_Services_Networking), [Azure](https://www.ipspace.net/Microsoft_Azure_Networking)) useful when preparing for a cloud migration project. Here's what [one of them wrote](https://www.ipspace.net/Microsoft_Azure_Networking#Happy_Campers):

> We are beginning to migrate some of our offerings to Microsoft Azure and I need to get up to speed with Azure products. I found this webinar very informative, and Ivan explained the concepts in a clear manner and easy to follow along. I would recommend watching these webinars and then read Microsoft documentation to get a thorough understanding.

Want to have some hands-on work sprinkled on top of that? You'll find deployment examples in the [Networking in Public Clouds GitHub repository](https://github.com/ipspace/pubcloud).
