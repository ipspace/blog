I wrote two dozen blog posts describing IP anycast concepts, from first-hop anycast gateways to anycast between DNS servers and global anycast (as used by large web properties), but never organized them in any usable form.

That's fixed: everything I ever wrote about anycast is nicely structured on the new [Anycast Resources](/series/anycast.html) page.
