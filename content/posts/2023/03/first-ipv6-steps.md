Even though IPv6 could buy its own beer (in US, let alone rest of the world), networking engineers still struggle with its deployment -- one of the [first questions](https://designclinic.ipspace.net/topic/ipv6-first-steps/) I got in the [ipSpace.net Design Clinic](https://www.ipspace.net/IpSpace.net_Design_Clinic) was:

> We have been tasked to start IPv6 planning. Can we discuss (for enterprises like us who all of the sudden want IPv6) which design paths to take?

I did my best to [answer this question](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Design/21.10.02%20-%20First%20Steps%20in%20IPv6%20Deployments.mp4?doccode=Design) and [describe the basics of creating an IPv6 addressing plan](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/get/Design/21.10.04%20-%20IPv6%20Addressing%20Plans%20and%20Prefix%20Delegation.mp4?doccode=Design). For even more details, watch the [IPv6 webinars](https://www.ipspace.net/IPv6) (most of them at least a few years old, but nothing changed in the IPv6 world in the meantime apart from the [SRv6 madness](/2019/01/srv6-one-tool-to-rule-them-all.html)).
