I have blog post ideas sitting in my to-write queue for over a decade. One of them is _why would you need a VRF (and associated router) between virtual servers and a firewall?_

Andrea Dainese answered at least part of that question in his [Off-Path firewall with Traffic Engineering](https://www.adainese.it/blog/2023/03/02/off-path-firewall-with-traffic-engineering/) blog post. Enjoy!
