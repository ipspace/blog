<div><span class="295183214-01112006"><font size="2">Although a bit outdated (and  discussing older Cisco IOS releases), the article <a href="http://www.windowsecurity.com/uplarticle/NetworkSecurity/ios_en.pdf">Cisco  IOS from an Attacker's Point of View</a> is still very relevant, as most  vulnerabilities discussed in it arise from unsecure router configuration. Highly  recommended reading!</font></span></div>
