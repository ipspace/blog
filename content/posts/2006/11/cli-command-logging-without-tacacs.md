title: CLI command logging without TACACS+
url: /2006/11/cli-command-logging-without-tacacs.html

The Cisco IOS's AAA architecture contains many handy features, including authorizing and logging every CLI command executed on the router. Unfortunately, the *AAA command accounting* only supports TACACS+ as the AAA transport protocol, making it unusable in RADIUS environments.

You can use Embedded Event Manager as a workaround. The following configuration commands will log every command executed on the router.
<!--more-->
```
event manager applet CLIaccounting
 event cli pattern ".*" sync no skip no
 action 1.0 syslog priority informational msg "$_cli_msg"
 set 2.0 _exit_status 1
```

The log messages generated by this EEM applet have the following format:

```
%HA_EM-6-LOG: CLIaccounting: *command*
```

As the EEM uses standard IOS logging mechanisms, you can use the **show logging** command to examine the command execution history or store the messages on a *syslog* server.

**Note:** As a side effect, all commands executed on a router will be echoed to the router's console unless you turn off console logging with the `no logging console` command or use TCL-based syslog filters (more about them in an upcoming post).
