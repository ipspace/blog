title: Use command aliases to simplify Cisco IOS web server URLs

Cisco IOS has the ability to define <em>command aliases</em> - short words that substitute a whole exec-mode or configuration command. These aliases can also be used in command execution URLs. For example, if you define <strong>alias exec showdefault show ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0</strong>, you can view the status of the default route with the <em>http://router/exec/showdefault/CR</em> URL.
