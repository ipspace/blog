If you're still stuck with frame-relay connections (or use them in test environment, because it's easy to set up any-to-any connectivity between a larger number of routers), you were probably used to subinterface logging events reporting when the line protocol on a point-to-point subinterface would go up or down based on LMI DLCI status.<br/><br/>Very quietly, these logging events disappeared, first on 7500-series routers in IOS release 12.1(14), now they're gone by default on all platforms. If you still want to see what's going on with your frame-relay subinterfaces, you have to enter <strong>logging event subif-link-status</strong> configuration command on every subinterface.<br/><br/>I can only guess that some people that used the <em>syslog </em>events for network management were very surprised by the first (undetected) frame-relay failure following an IOS upgrade :)
