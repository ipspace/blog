Another un(der)documented fact: when you access the router's home page (assuming HTTP or HTTPS server has been enabled), the router displays:<br/><ol><li>The <strong>home.html</strong> file if it exists in any filesystem;</li>
<li>The <strong>home.shtml</strong> file if it exists in any filesystem;</li>
<li>a default page with links to <em>exec, SDM, QDM </em>and TAC support</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> even though you can access <strong>home.html</strong> file on <strong>flash:</strong> device directly, that web page cannot reference any other file in <strong>flash:</strong> as a relative link unless you specify <strong>flash:</strong> as the default path for the HTTP requests with the <strong>ip http path flash:</strong> command.</p>
