Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) can perform per-packet or per-destination (actually <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2006/10/cef-load-sharing-details.html">source/destination IP address pair</a>) load-sharing with no performance degradation (without CEF, per-packet load-sharing requires process switching). Even though there is no performance impact on the router, per-packet load sharing will almost always result in out-of-order packets. The packet reordering might degrade TCP throughput in high-speed environments (in low-speed/few-flows scenarios, per-packet load-sharing actually improves the per-flow throughput) or severely impact applications that cannot survive out-of-order packet delivery, such as Fast Sequenced Transport for SNA over IP or voice/video streams.<br/><br/>To configure per-packet load-sharing, use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">ip load-sharing per-packet</span> interface configuration command (default is per-destination). This command has to be configured on all outgoing interfaces over which the traffic is load-shared.<p class="note">The switch between the load-sharing modes is not immediate; sometimes you have to wait a few seconds for the <strong>ip load-sharing</strong> command to take effect, worst case a manual clearing of the CEF table (<strong>clear ip cef <em>address</em></strong>) is required.</p>
