As I get a lot of hits from Google refering to local login, here's the whole story: Cisco IOS supports local username/password based authentication (almost) forever (it's been there even before the AAA architecture). To change from simple password-based authentication to username+password based on, use <strong>login local </strong>configuration command on console and/or VTY lines. The local usernames and passwords are <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2006/10/multilevel-web-http-access-to-router.html">defined with the <strong>username </strong>configuration command</a>.<!--more-->The Cisco IOS thus supports the following local (non-AAA) authentication settings:<br/><ul><li><strong>no login</strong> disables any authentication; anyone able to access the line (console or VTY through telnet or SSH) is logged in automatically (do not use outside of lab environment). </li>
<li><strong>login</strong> enables simple password-based authentication. The password is specified per-<strong>line</strong> (console or VTY)  with the <strong>password </strong>command (do not specify different passwords on different VTY lines or you'll create total confusion).</li>
<li><strong>login local</strong> enables local username+password authentication.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">The <strong>login tacacs</strong> configuration command specifies the old TACACS protocol and is almost unusable these days.</p>
