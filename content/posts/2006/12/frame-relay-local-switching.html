Cisco IOS supported Frame Relay switching (emulation of a Frame Relay switch) for a very long time. First they've implemented local switching, then remote switching over a GRE tunnel. With the introduction of generic Layer 2 transport across a layer-3 backbone (L2TPv3 or AToM), Frame Relay switching got integrated into the new infrastructure, but never implemented completely ... that is, until release 12.0(27)S and 12.4(11)T which finally <a href="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios120/120newft/120limit/120s/120s27/fslocal.htm">supports local switching</a> in the new architecture. We've also got a few extra goodies: now you can do DTE-to-DTE switching (interconnecting two Frame Relay switches with a router) or same-port switching (switching two DLCIs terminating on the same router port).<!--more-->The new configuration commands differ only slightly from the old ones. To start with, you have to define DLCIs with the <strong>frame-relay interface-dlci switched</strong> interface configuration command and use the <strong>connect</strong> global configuration command to establish switching between two DLCIs. A working example is included below:<pre class="code">frame-relay switching<br/>!<br/>interface Serial0/0/0<br/> frame-relay intf-type dce<br/> frame-relay interface-dlci 100 switched<br/>!<br/>interface Serial0/0/1<br/> frame-relay interface-dlci 200 switched<br/>!<br/>connect FR100_200 Serial0/0/0 100 Serial0/0/1 200</pre>
