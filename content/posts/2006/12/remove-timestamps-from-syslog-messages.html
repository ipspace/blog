The ability to replace <em>router uptime</em> with <em>date and time</em> in the logging messages with the <strong>service timestamps log datetime</strong> command was present in IOS for a long time, but I was always annoyed at timestamps when collecting syslog messages for demonstration purposes. The command to turn them off has also been available "forever", but was too obvious for me to try out ... the <strong>no service timestamps log </strong>command.
