title: Cisco IOS violates RFC 2616 (HTTP/1.1)
url: /2006/12/cisco-ios-violates-rfc-2616-http11.html

<p class="update"><strong>Update 2012-08-27</strong>: Stefan de Kooter reported the bug had been fixed in IOS release 15.1(4)M.</p>
<p>I simply had to check with the RFC; by <a href="/2006/12/ios-http-client-sets-host-field-to-ip.html">setting the Host: field of HTTP request to an IP address</a> (instead of a host name), Cisco IOS violates <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.23">section 14.23 of RFC 2616</a>, which says:</p>
<blockquote class="cite">The Host request-header field specifies the Internet host and port number of the resource being requested, <strong>as obtained from the original URI given by the user</strong> or referring resource ... The Host field value MUST represent the naming authority of the origin server or gateway given by the original URL.</blockquote>
