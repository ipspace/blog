If you have HTTP server enabled  on your router (on by default in many IOS releases, enable with <strong>ip http  server</strong>), you can download the current router configuration into your  web browser simply by typing in the URL <font face="Courier New">http://router/exec/show/running/full</font>. To get the  startup configuration, use <font face="Courier New">http://router/exec/show/startup-config/CR.</font><br/><br/>Of course, you need to  authenticate to the router. By default, you can use anything as the username and  the <strong>enable-password </strong>as the password, but youÂ also use  local usernames or AAA authentication. To <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2006/10/multilevel-web-http-access-to-router.html">use local usernames</a>, configure <strong>ip http authentication local </strong>and enter username and password  with the <strong>username <em>username </em>privilege 15 password <em>password</em></strong> configuration command.
