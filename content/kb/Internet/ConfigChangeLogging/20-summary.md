Cisco IOS gives you a variety of router configuration management tools. In this article, youâ€™ve seen how to use the Configuration Change Notification and Logging feature to log all router configuration changes. You can also use this feature to send all configuration commands entered on a router to an external *syslog* server to ensure all changes to a router configuration are immediately stored in an off-site archive.

{{<note info>}}
If you want to use the configuration change logging feature as a security audit mechanism, configure *syslog* to [use TCP as the transport protocol](http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2006/10/running-syslog-over-tcp.html).
