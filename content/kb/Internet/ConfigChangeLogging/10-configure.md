The Configuration Change Notification feature is configured within the **log config** part of the **archive** section, and its configuration is rather trivial:

* You have to enable configuration change logging and specify the size of the logging buffer.
* You might ask the router to create configuration-change-related *syslog* messages in plaintext or XML
* It's also a good idea to configure **hidekeys** to hide passwords and other sensitive information in the log buffer and syslog messages.

A typical configuration is shown in the following printout:

{{<cc>}}Configuration commands for Configuration Change Notification and Logging feature{{</cc>}}
```
archive
 log config
  logging enable
  logging size 200
  notify syslog
  hidekeys
```

After configuring the Configuration Change Logging, all configuration commands are stored in a circular buffer in the router’s memory (the log of changes is lost on reload).

You can inspect the commands with the **show archive log config** command, which displays all configuration commands recently entered on the router or commands entered by a particular user or even within a single configuration session (from the moment you enter **configure terminal** to the time you exit the configuration mode). A sample printout of this command is shown below:

{{<cc>}}Display of logged configuration commands{{</cc>}}
```
fw#show archive log config all
 idx   sess           user@line      Logged command
    1     1        console@console  |  logging enable
    2     1        console@console  |  logging size 200
    3     1        console@console  |  notify syslog
    4     2        console@console  |archive
    5     2        console@console  | log config
    6     2        console@console  |  hidekeys
```

If you’ve configured the **notify syslog** option of the **log config** configuration command, all configuration commands entered on a router are also sent to the logging subsystem, which delivers them to various logging destinations, including console and *syslog* hosts. The syslog messages usually contain the username and the configuration command, but they could also report changes in significant data structures. For example, if you add a local user with the **username** command, the router will generate the two *syslog* messages:

{{<cc>}}Syslog messages generated by security-relevant configuration command{{</cc>}}
```
fw#conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
fw(config)#user x password y
01:43:06: %PARSER-5-CFGLOG_LOGGEDCMD: User:console  logged command:username x password *****
01:43:06: %PARSER-5-CFGLOG_LOGGEDCMD: User:console  logged command:!config: USER TABLE MODIFIED
```
