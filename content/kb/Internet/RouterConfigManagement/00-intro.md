If you’ve ever had to manage and configure more than a few routers in a production environment, you’ve probably stumbled across questions like these:

* Who changed the configuration on a router that stopped working? What was changed?
* What’s the difference between the current configuration and the startup configuration?
* Do we have a backup of a working configuration?
* What was the router configuration before the last mistake was committed to the startup configuration?
* Do I have a copy of the configuration used a month ago?
* How do I roll back from the current mess to the startup configuration without reloading the router?

Until Cisco IOS release 12.4, Cisco did almost nothing to help us. Router configuration management was a lucrative niche market for network management vendors offering increasingly complex tools with fancy graphic user interfaces, supposedly solving the configuration management nightmare.

Cisco IOS release 12.4 radically changed the landscape with router configuration management features like the Contextual Configuration Diff utility, Configuration Change Notification and Logging, Configuration Archive, and Configuration Replace and Rollback. These features sounded almost too good to be true, so I stress-tested them with a few challenging tasks.

Initially published in 2006, this article was updated and republished on ipSpace.net in January 2025. The republished article includes newer test results from Cisco IOS release 15.9 and Cisco IOS XE release 17.12.

Numerous other vendors introduced similar features in the meantime. You can also use open-source tools like Rancid or Oxidized to collect device configurations or build configuration management workflows using [GitOps principles](/2018/08/gitops-in-networking/) ([more details](/series/cicd)).

This article describes two of these features: the capabilities of the Configuration Change Notification feature and the usage guidelines for the Contextual Configuration Diff feature. It also discusses their benefits, shortcomings, and current limitations.
