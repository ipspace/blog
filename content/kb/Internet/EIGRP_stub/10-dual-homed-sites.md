In most mission-critical networks, the remote sites have at least two upstream links to two core routers (see the next diagram). In these designs, the amount of DUAL traffic generated by an outage is significantly higher than in the previous scenario, as both central routers start querying the remote offices.

Furthermore, if the core routers lose their direct connectivity (for example, the LAN interface of one of them fails), the transit traffic might start flowing across remote sites, congesting their slow-speed links:

{{<figure src="EIGRP_4.gif" caption="Link failure turns spoke sites into transit sites">}}

Both undesired effects are solved very effectively by the EIGRP stub routers. The stub routers are not queried in the DUAL process, thus the WAN link congestion is avoided. Furthermore, as these routers never propagate EIGRP routes to other EIGRP neighbors, they cannot become transit routers.

For example, the next printout displays the EIGRP topology table on router A1 when the connectivity between A1 and A2 was lost and the remote office routers were not configured as stub routers. The routes beyond A2 are reachable through all remote office routers (B1 and B2).

When the remote office routers are configured as stub routers, A1 loses its connectivity to 10.1.0.0/24 when its connection to A2 is lost:
