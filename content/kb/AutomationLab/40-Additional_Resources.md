Finally, you might also find these resources useful:

- Hank Preston wrote simple guide to [Network Programmability with Vagrant](https://github.com/hpreston/vagrant_net_prog)
- David Barroso published a [tutorial describing how to set up a mixed Arista/Juniper environment](https://github.com/dravetech/network-tutorials/tree/master/tutorial-0-building-env).
- Jaap de Voos [built a Docker network automation container](https://packetpushers.net/building-a-docker-network-automation-container/)
- Cumulus Networks has a [fantastic demo topology](https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/cldemo-vagrant) that includes a tool to build Vagrantfile from DOT (graph) files.
- You’ll find sample Junos Vagrant topologies in [JNPRautomate](https://github.com/JNPRautomate) repositories (explore the repositories and look for Vagrantfile)
- Cumulus topology with 2 spines, 4 leafs and 2 servers is in [Pete Lumbis’ Interop 2016 demo](https://gitlab.com/plumbis/interop-2016) (the Vagrantfile is in the [Repository tab](https://gitlab.com/plumbis/interop-2016/tree/master)).
- Sample Vagrantfile [creating two arista virtual switches](https://github.com/jerearista/vagrant-veos/blob/master/examples/leaf-spine/Vagrantfile). They published a full-blown topology a while ago, but I wasn’t able to find it.
- [Run Junos as a Docker container](http://p.ip.fi/h4qu)
