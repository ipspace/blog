title: IPv6 Access to Published Ports
url: /kb/DockerSvc/50-ipv6.html
---
The [previous section](30-nat-iptables.html) described the role of userland **docker-proxy** supporting containers connecting to [published ports](20-Published.html), or local processes connecting to loopback interface. We've also seen that when a published port is not bound to a specific IPv4 address, the proxy process listens on an IPv6 socket, enabling IPv6 access to services offered in IPv4-only containers.

{{<note info>}}Docker proxy is a simple TCP or UDP proxy, not a NAT64 implementation.{{</note>}}

It's easy to check whether the expected IPv6 functionality works: connect to a published port on ::1 from a local process:

{{<cc>}}Published port 8080 is accessible through IPv6{{</cc>}}
```
$ docker run --rm -d --name web_1 -p 8080:80 webapp
3398eae2649a55d2b9aa11c4979a50e025c035e34227537f4f4bd91c3ba44c9f
$ curl http://[::1]:8080/

<b>Hostname:</b> 3398eae2649a<br/>
<b>Remote IP:</b> 172.17.0.1
```

As expected, the remote IP address seen by the web server running in a Docker container (our [Flask application](10-Exposed.html)) is the source IPv4 address of the outgoing **docker-proxy** session.

If you want to see IPv6 and IPv4 TCP sessions going through the **docker-proxy** process, use **telnet** to connect to a published port and **netstat** to display the established sessions:

{{<cc>}}Incoming IPv6 connection mapped into an outgoing IPv4 connection{{</cc>}}
```
$ netstat -nt
Active Internet connections (w/o servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address    Foreign Address State
tcp        0      0 172.17.0.1:52880 172.17.0.2:80   ESTABLISHED
tcp6       0      0 ::1:8080         ::1:41534       ESTABLISHED
tcp6       0      0 ::1:41534        ::1:8080        ESTABLISHED
```

IPv6 access to published ports is obviously not limited to the local processes; IPv6 clients can reach a container-based service as soon as you have an IPv6 address configured on an external interface.

{{<cc>}}IPv6 address configured on eth1 interface of Docker host{{</cc>}}
```
$ ip addr show dev eth1
3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc...
    link/ether 08:00:27:9b:8a:66 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.33.2/24 brd 192.168.33.255 scope global eth1
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 2001:db8::2/64 scope global
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:fe9b:8a66/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

{{<cc>}}IPv6 access from an external client{{</cc>}}
```
worker-1$ curl http://[2001:db8::2]:8080/

<b>Hostname:</b> 3398eae2649a<br/>
<b>Remote IP:</b> 172.17.0.1
```

## Limitations

While the Docker proxy enables convenient IPv6 connectivity to published container ports, it does not provide the true client identity information - it's a simple TCP proxy and thus does not add HTTP headers or any other indication what the actual client IPv6 address might be.

You can easily check that claim with our Flask application, which returns original HTTP headers when invoked with the `/headers` path. You'll see the headers generated by the web client, but no extra headers like `X-Forwarded-For` a typical web proxy might insert.

{{<cc>}}HTTP headers received by the web server{{</cc>}}
```
$ curl http://[2001:db8::2]:8080/headers
User-Agent: curl/7.58.0
Host: [2001:db8::2]:8080
Accept: */*
```
