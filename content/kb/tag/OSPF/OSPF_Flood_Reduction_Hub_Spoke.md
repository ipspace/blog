title: OSPF Flooding Filters in Hub-and-Spoke Environments
url: /kb/tag/OSPF/OSPF_Flood_Reduction_Hub_Spoke.html
---
The OSPF flood reduction functionality configured with the **ip ospf database-filter all out** interface configuration command can be used to reduce OSPF traffic and minimize the OSPF database size on small remote routers in hub-and-spoke environments.

The command stops all OSPF flooding over the selected interface and shall be used on a hub router in a hub-and-spoke network to stop the LSA flooding over the hub-to-spoke links. The flooding in the spoke-to-hub direction is not affected. The hub router and any other regular OSPF router in the network retain full visibility of the OSPF topology database, while the spoke router’s OSPF database contains only locally originated LSAs.

Since no LSAs are propagated from the hub router to the spoke routers, the spoke routers have to use a routing mechanism other than OSPF to reach the hub router. A static default route pointing to the hub router is usually used in environments where the spoke routers have a single upstream connection to the hub router.

## Sample Network

The OSPF flood reduction is best illustrated with a sample hub-and-spoke network. A network with three spoke sites and a hub site (see the following figure) was used to generate the printouts.

{{<figure src="OSPF_Flood_Reduction.png" caption="The topology and IP addressing of the sample network">}}

Before the **ip ospf database-filter all out** command has been configured on the hub router, the OSPF database on the spoke routers contained all LSAs originated within the area (no out-of-area LSAs were originated by the hub router as the area 1 was configured with the **area 1 nssa no-summary** router configuration command on the hub router).

Similarly, the IP routing table on the spoke routers contained all the routes within the area:

```

```

## Configuring OSPF Flood Reduction

After the OSPF flood reduction is configured on the hub router, the OSPF database size on the spoke routers is reduced and they lose all OSPF routes:

{{<cc>}}OSPF flooding reduction is configured on the hub router{{</cc>}}
```
Hub#conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
Hub(config)#interface serial 1/0
Hub(config-if)#ip ospf database-filter all out
Hub(config-if)#
%OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 10.0.0.11 on Serial1/0 from FULL to DOWN, →
Neighbor Down: Interface down or detached
%OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 10.0.0.13 on Serial1/0 from FULL to DOWN, →
Neighbor Down: Interface down or detached
%OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 10.0.0.12 on Serial1/0 from FULL to DOWN, →
Neighbor Down: Interface down or detached
%OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 10.0.0.12 on Serial1/0 from LOADING to FULL, →

%OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 10.0.0.11 on Serial1/0 from LOADING to FULL, →
Loading Done
%OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 10.0.0.13 on Serial1/0 from LOADING to FULL, →
Loading Done 
```

{{<note warn>}}All OSPF adjacencies established over the selected interface are dropped when the OSPF flood reduction is configured or disabled. The LSAs in the spoke routers are flushed after they are aged out (up to one hour); you could accelerate this process with the **clear ip ospf process** command.{{</note>}}

{{<cc>}}OSPF database on the spoke router contains the locally-originated LSA{{</cc>}}
```
S1#show ip ospf database

```

{{<cc>}}IP routing table on the spoke router contains no OSPF routes{{</cc>}}
```
S1#show ip route | begin Gateway

C       10.1.0.0/24 is directly connected, Serial1/0 
```

## Configuring Static Default Route on the Spoke Routers

Following the OSPF flood reduction configuration, the spoke routers no longer have connectivity beyond the directly-connected interface of the hub router. You have to configure a static default route pointing to the hub router on the spoke routers:

{{<cc>}}Static default route configuration on the spoke router{{</cc>}}
```
S1#conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
S1(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.1.0.1
S1(config)#^Z
S1#
%SYS-5-CONFIG_I: Configured from console by console 
```

{{<cc>}}Final IP routing table on the spoke router{{</cc>}}
```
S1#show ip route | begin Gateway
Gateway of last resort is 10.1.0.1 to network 0.0.0.0

     10.0.0.0/8 is variably subnetted, 3 subnets, 2 masks
C       10.0.0.11/32 is directly connected, Loopback0
C       10.2.11.0/24 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/0
C       10.1.0.0/24 is directly connected, Serial1/0
S*   0.0.0.0/0 [1/0] via 10.1.0.1 
```

You can use **ping** on the spoke routers after you have configured static default routes to verify spoke-to-hub and spoke-to-spoke connectivity.

{{<note info>}}You should always use extended **ping** to check connectivity between the LAN interfaces of the selected routers.{{</note>}}

{{<cc>}}Connectivity checks performed on the spoke router{{</cc>}}
```
S1#ping 10.2.1.1 source FastEthernet 0/0

Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.2.1.1, timeout is 2 seconds:
Packet sent with a source address of 10.2.11.1
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 36/101/228 ms
S1#ping 10.2.12.1 source FastEthernet 0/0

Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.2.12.1, timeout is 2 seconds:
Packet sent with a source address of 10.2.11.1
!!!!!
