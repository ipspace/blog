title: Running Ansible in a Vagrant-Controlled Virtual Machine
url: /kb/Ansible/Running_Ansible_Vagrant_VM.html

Most network automation tutorials using Ansible with Vagrant assume that you’re running Ansible on your host machine. I prefer running Ansible in another virtual machine for these reasons:

-   While Mac OSX is *almost* Unix, but there might be slight discrepancies between Linux and OSX behavior that would result in hard-to-troubleshoot failures.
-   I managed to completely mess up my Python environment while trying to work with multiple Ansible versions simultaneously. Doing that on my workstation would be a disaster. Recovering the virtual machine took just a few minutes.
-   If you’re running Windows you have no options anyway – Ansible doesn’t run on Windows.

However, Ansible running in a virtual machine has to be able to access other network devices via SSH or HTTP(S) connections. Accessing network devices outside of the host machine is easy (Vagrant VMs have full access to outside networks), accessing other virtual machines (network devices) running on the same host could become an interesting exercise, more so if you use VirtualBox.

<div class='warn' markdown='1'>Use the information in this article *only when running Ansible in a virtual machine*. If you want to run Ansible on the host on which you run Vagrant, [you need this one](https://www.ipspace.net/kb/Ansible/Ansible_Inventory_Vagrant.html).</div>

## VMware Desktop Virtualization

When you’re using VMware Fusion or Workstation as your virtualization environment Vagrant uses **vmnet** interface to connect to the individual virtual machines. Each virtual machine thus has a fixed IP address reachable from other virtual machines (like an out-of-band management network).

### Sample VMware Fusion Environment

In the [Ansible for Networking Engineers](https://www.ipspace.net/Ansible_for_Networking_Engineers) webinar I demonstrated scripts that work on Cisco IOS, Nexus OS and Junos. Cisco IOS and Nexus OS were running in a VIRL VM, Ansible and Junos vSRX were running in Vagrant-controlled VMs. The [Vagrantfile I used](https://github.com/ipspace/NetOpsWorkshop/blob/master/install/Vagrantfile-SRX) is in my [Network Automation Workshop](https://github.com/ipspace/NetOpsWorkshop) GitHub repository.

**vagrant ssh-config** shows both Vagrant-controlled VMs connected to **vmnet** network (IP prefix 192.168.178.0/24 on my laptop) and reachable on port 22:

```
$ vagrant ssh-config | ack 'Host|Port'
Host nms  
  HostName 192.168.178.141  
  Port 22  
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null  
  StrictHostKeyChecking no  
Host srx  
  HostName 192.168.178.142  
  Port 22  
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null  
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
```

Conclusion: NMS VM can reach vSRX VM directly by connecting to port 22 on IP address 192.168.178.142.

## Using VirtualBox

Vagrant implements access to VMs running in VirtualBox environment though a dynamically configured NAT interface. The VMs started by Vagrant are not connected to an internal management network (like in the VMware case) and thus cannot communicate to each other directly.

It is, however, still possible to reach other VMs by going through the host IP stack and using SSH port numbers assigned to individual VMs by Vagrant. This concept is best illustrated with an example.

### Sample VirtualBox Environment

One of the VirtualBox environments you’ll find in my [Network Automation](https://github.com/ipspace/NetOpsWorkshop) GitHub repository is a leaf-and-spine topology using Arista vEOS (explore the *topologies* directory for more details).

That topology has four vEOS switches and an Ansible VM. While I added a dedicated management network to the topology, it’s still possible to reach vEOS switches from the Ansible VM going through the host TCP/IP stack.

**vagrant ssh-config** executed in a VirtualBox environment doesn’t display VM-specific IP addreses. VMs are reachable through the local loopback interface (127.0.0.1) on ports mapped by Vagrant:

```
$ vagrant ssh-config | ack 'Host|Port' 
Host spine-1  
  HostName 127.0.0.1  
  Port 2222  
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null  
  StrictHostKeyChecking no  
Host spine-2  
  HostName 127.0.0.1  
  Port 2200  
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null  
  StrictHostKeyChecking no  
Host leaf-1  
  HostName 127.0.0.1  
  Port 2201  
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null  
  StrictHostKeyChecking no  
Host leaf-2  
  HostName 127.0.0.1  
  Port 2202  
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null  
  StrictHostKeyChecking no  
Host nms  
  HostName 127.0.0.1  
  Port 2203  
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null  
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
```

When logging into a VM from the host, the SSH session seems to be coming from a weird (hidden) IP address:

```
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ who
vagrant  pts/0        2016-12-18 15:00 (10.0.2.2)
```

The Ethernet interface of the Vagrant-controlled VM has another weird IP address:

```
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ ifconfig eth0
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 08:00:27:7e:84:45  
          inet addr:10.0.2.15  Bcast:10.0.2.255  Mask:255.255.255.0  
          inet6 addr: fe80::a00:27ff:fe7e:8445/64 Scope:Link  
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1  
          RX packets:1336 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0  
          TX packets:1161 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0  
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000  
          RX bytes:160029 (160.0 KB)  TX bytes:107337 (107.3 KB)
```

{{<note info>}}It looks like **10.0.2.2** and **10.0.2.15** are fixed IP addresses used by Vagrant in VirtualBox environment. I couldn’t find this behavior described in Vagrant documentation, but there are plenty of hits on the Internet discussing it.{{</note>}}

Using the IP address of the host TCP/IP stack (10.0.2.2) and TCP port number mapped to SSH port on another VM it’s possible to open a SSH session from Ansible VM to a virtual networking device. For example, to reach *leaf-1* vEOS node, I’d run **ssh -p 2201 10.0.2.2**.

```
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ ssh -p 2201 10.0.2.2  
Password:  
Last login: Sun Dec 18 15:01:07 2016 from 10.0.2.2  
leaf-1#
```

All you have to do to access virtual networking devices from Ansible playbooks is to build an inventory file that specifies **ansible\_host** and **ansible\_port** for every managed device. In my case that inventory file would look like this:

```
spine-1 ansible_host=10.0.2.2 ansible_port=2222 ansible_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_pass=vagrant
spine-2 ansible_host=10.0.2.2 ansible_port=2200 ansible_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_pass=vagrant
leaf-1  ansible_host=10.0.2.2 ansible_port=2201 ansible_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_pass=vagrant
leaf-2  ansible_host=10.0.2.2 ansible_port=2202 ansible_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_pass=vagrant
```

To build that inventory file use the [Vagrant2Inventory.py](https://github.com/ipspace/NetOpsWorkshop/tree/master/topologies/tools) tool [described here](https://www.ipspace.net/kb/Ansible/Ansible_Inventory_Vagrant.html).
