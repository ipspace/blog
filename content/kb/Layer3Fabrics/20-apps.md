The optimal approach to any distributed systems challenge is to solve the complex problems at the edge[^1], and using the network core as a simple transport mechanism.

We could use this approach to build simple layer-3-only transport fabrics, and solve the redudancy issues within the end-hosts:

* IP subnet assignments closely follow the physical network topology. The size of layer-2 domains is kept to a minimum;
* The network provides a unique IP address to every endpoint network interface (uplink);
* Multiple IP addresses assigned to redundantly connected endpoints (hosts/servers) could belong to different subnets;
* Clients running on redundantly connected endpoints can use multiple IP addresses, potentially establishing multiple sessions (one per interface) with the same server and distributing requests across all the sessions;
* Service endpoints are available on multiple (server) IP addresses and the clients try to connect to every service endpoint until a successful connection is established.

Well-known solutions using this approach include:

* SCTP transport protocol[^2] that is unfortunately rarely used[^3], for example, in SS7 signaling.
* Multipath TCP[^4] that allows a client TCP stack to open multiple TCP sessions to the same server and use them concurrently (including load balancing) while giving the appearance of a single TCP session to the application[^5].

{{<note info>}}Multipath TCP allows the client to use multiple IP addresses, but does not address the problem of service being available on multiple IP addresses.{{</note>}}

* Multipath I/O in iSCSI implementations that allows the servers to use all uplinks for storage traffic[^6].

Very few other solutions, applications or products can use the same approach due to challenges faced when implementing this approach on commonly deployed TCP/IP stacks.
