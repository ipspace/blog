After dabbling with Ansible for the generation of device configurations based on templates,
and some simple playbooks a while ago, I was fortunate enough to have a brief period in
which I had some time to spend on the
[ipSpace.net Network Automation online course](https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions).
While working on the course assignments, I immediately started to apply the newly acquired skills
in my daytime job.

The idea was to see if I could integrate Ansible into the organization- and business processes to the point where
it would become an indispensable tool, a tool worth maintaining by others after I moved on to the next job.
And of course, to have fun while finding out.

And indeed, while the projects discussed in this article are a never-ending work-in-progress, they have so
far resulted in several useful applications which are finding their way into daily routines. More importantly,
they have opened up endless possibilities for future projects and initiatives. So if you havenâ€™t started
your automation journey yet, get started now ðŸ˜‰.
