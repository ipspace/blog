## Formatting Ansible Playbook Outputs

Output generated by **ansible-playbook** can be formatted using
[callback plugins](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/callback.html) included
in Ansible distribution. The **selective** callback is particularly useful, as it allows
you to control what is displayed with the `tags: [ print_action ]` attribute. Unfortunately,
it outputs additional codes for formatting and colorizing the output.

I ended up working around this by copying selective.py to the directory **callback_plugins**
in the playbook directory, editing it, and changing `return msg` to:

```
    if DONT_COLORIZE:
        return msg.encode('utf-8')
```

The environment variable **ANSIBLE_SELECTIVE_DONT_COLORIZE** can now be used to toggle the
formatting of output messages, greatly enhancing the readability of the Ansible output in
a web browser. I am now playing with outputting HTML text where each output category
(‘changed’, ‘failed’, ‘skipped’, etc.) is mapped to its own CSS **div** class.
