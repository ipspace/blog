Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation (MLAG) is a solution that allows you to terminate a link aggregation group (sometimes also known as *etherchannel*) on multiple devices. 

It's often used to implement redundant server connections; it was also popular in the days of layer-2 fabrics built with Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). The latter use case is mostly obsolete in the VXLAN/EVPN world.
