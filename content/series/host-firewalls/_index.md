In September 2020, [Matthias Luft](https://www.ipspace.net/Author:Matthias_Luft) wrote an introductory article describing host-based firewalls (traffic filtering functionality deployed on end-hosts). His article triggered numerous questions including:

* Why don't we have dynamic firewall policies where the end-hosts could specify which TCP/UDP ports they need?
* Can we use traffic flow analysis to reverse-engineer firewall rules?
* Is there any chance of fixing this problem?
