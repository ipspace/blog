You must use BGP as the endpoint reachability routing protocol in your data center fabric if you decide to run VXLAN with EVPN control plane... but should you also run it as the transport (underlay) routing protocol instead of OSPF or IS-IS? The resources collected on this page might help you make that decision.

We covered this topic in these webinars, articles, and podcasts:

[Petr Lapukhov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petrlapu/) (the author of [BGP-as-better-IGP idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJbqnOdD3cg)) initially proposed to use BGP as a data center SDN mechanism. I covered that use case in the [BGP-Based SDN Solutions](https://www.ipspace.net/BGP-Based_SDN_Solutions) webinar and in these blog posts:

We also tried to answer the question "*Do we need a new routing protocol for data center fabrics?*" in these Software Gone Wild episodes and related blog posts (TL&DL: No):

I covered the design aspects of using BGP in data centers (in particular in combination with EVPN) in these blog posts:

It's also popular to run BGP on redundantly connected servers, or on edge appliances connecting overlay virtual networks with physical world. More details in these blog posts and in the [Routing on Servers](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Clos#ROUTING_SERVERS) part of [Leaf-and-Spine Fabric Architectures](https://www.ipspace.net/Leaf-and-Spine_Fabric_Architectures) webinar.

The designers of Cumulus Linux preferred the EBGP-only data center design, and added numerous features to their BGP routing daemon (now FRR). We covered those features in the [FRRouting Architecture and Features](https://www.ipspace.net/FRRouting_Architecture_and_Features) webinar, in the [Cumulus Linux](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DCFabric#CUMULUS) part of the [Data Center Fabric Architectures](https://www.ipspace.net/Data_Center_Fabrics) webinar, and in these blog posts:

Some vendors love making your life overly complex, inventing ridiculous architectures like running IBGP (EVPN) over EBGP (IP routing). Here are a few choice ~~rants~~ blog posts on that topic:
