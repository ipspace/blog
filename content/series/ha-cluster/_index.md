title: High Availability Service Clusters

Clusters of servers offering the same service in active/standby or active/active setup are a common high availability solution. They work very well as long as:

* The clustering software can reliably detect partitions -- there should always be an odd number of cluster members, or extra witness nodes
* The cluster is not stretched across unreliable infrastructure.

You should also understand how these solutions work:

* Node or service failure in an active/standby setup might cause significant downtime while the service is restarted on another cluster member.
* No clustering solution will protect you against operator mistakes.

Not surprisingly, solutions created by networking vendors (including [multi-chassis link aggregation](/series/mlag.html) clusters) ignore all of the above. This is what I had to say about the sad state of affairs:

SDN controllers are no exception:

One of the worst examples of the services clusters are firewall clusters. They are almost always implemented with two nodes without a witness, and often stretched across multiple data centers.
