{{<quote source="Wikipedia" link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code">}}Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.{{</quote>}}

{{<quote source="Generated by ChatGPT in February 2023">}}Network infrastructure as code refers to the practice of automating the configuration, deployment, and management of network resources using software development techniques. This approach involves defining network infrastructure and policies as code, which can be version controlled, tested, and deployed using tools such as Git, Jenkins, or Ansible. With network infrastructure as code, organizations can reduce manual errors, increase agility, and improve scalability and security in their network operations.{{</quote>}}

Translated into plain English: using NIAC principles (see below) you describe the desired state of networking infrastructure (your [intent](../tag/intent-based-networking.html)) in text files that can be managed with traditional source code control tools like Git. You could use NIAC to manage traditional device configurations (which would be a very-low-level intent) or as part of a solution that uses abstract high-level data model.

These blog posts cover NIAC principles:

A few blog posts discussed how hard it is to implement infrastructure-as-code or intent-based networking with the new cool kid on the block: REST API.

We even did a podcast or two on the topic:
