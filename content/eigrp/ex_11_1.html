      <p style="mso-pagination:widow-orphan;mso-list:skip">Propose a new
      AppleTalk routing design that will reduce the EIGRP diameter without
      increasing the load on low-speed access-layer links.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

      <p>The only way to reduce EIGRP diameter in AppleTalk network is to
      introduce another routing protocol in the network. As the load on
      low-speed links shall not increase, the new routing protocol has to be
      introduced in the ATM backbone. Since AppleTalk implementation of EIGRP
      does not support several EIGRP processes, only RTMP or AURP are a viable
      alternative. The new routing design would therefore be:
      <ul>
        <li>Run AppleTalk EIGRP in each Frame Relay cloud;</li>
        <li>Run RTMP or AURP in the ATM backbone;</li>
        <li>Redistribute AppleTalk EIGRP into RTMP/AURP (and vice versa) at each
          core router.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please refer also to the section &quot;Case study solution&quot; in
      Chapter 11 for additional design details and router configurations.
