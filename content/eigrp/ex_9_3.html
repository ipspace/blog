      <p class="SB" style="mso-pagination:widow-orphan;mso-list:skip">Why would
      a PVC failure to a remote office involve other remote offices in diffusing
      computation ?<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

      <p>Whenever a PVC between distribution-layer router (for example, <i>DR-1</i>)
      and a remote office (for example, <i>RO-11</i>) fails, the distribution
      layer router starts diffusing computation as it has no feasible successor
      for the remote office routes. During the diffusing computation the
      distribution-layer router sends queries to all neighbors, including both
      core routers and all other remote offices connected to the same
      distribution-layer router.
