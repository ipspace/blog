      </h3>
      <p class="SB" style="mso-pagination:widow-orphan;mso-list:skip">Chicago
      router has two equal-cost routes toward San Francisco LAN, as the cost of
      these routes is dictated by the lowest bandwidth on the path - 64 kbps
      between San Francisco and San Jose. The traffic going from Chicago toward
      San Francisco will be equally distributed on both links between Chicago
      and San Jose, whereas the desired ratio would be 2:1 based on the link
      speeds.

      </h3>
      <p class="SB" style="mso-pagination:widow-orphan;mso-list:skip">How could you modify the EIGRP design in network
      shown above to ensure proportional load balancing from Chicago toward all
      destinations in the San Jose area?&nbsp;
      </p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>There are three solutions to this exercise:
<ul>
  <li>modify the bandwidth on the San Francisco - San Jose link to be
          higher than 2 Mbps. The cost of the routes between Chicago and San
          Francisco will be dictated by the new minimum bandwidth on the links
          between Chicago and San Jose. <font color="#FF0000">This solution is
          not recommended as it may lead to WAN-related problems due to
          misconfigured interface bandwidth.</font></li>
  <li>Run another routing protocol (for example, RIP) between San Jose and
          remote sites in Bay area and redistribute routes toward the remote
          sites into the EIGRP process with a high bandwidth, for example using
          command</li>
      <pre>router eigrp 100
 redistribute rip 5000000 10000 100 100 1500</pre>
  <li>Run another routing protocol (for example, RIP) between San Jose and
          remote sites in Bay area. Deploy BGP in the network and redistribute
          RIP routes into BGP. The routes of remote sites in Bay area (for
          example, San Francisco) are no longer in EIGRP topology table, so the
          routing from Chicago toward sites in Bay area is influenced only by
          the EIGRP cost of BGP next hop (San Jose router), resulting in desired
          load sharing. Please refer to Case Study #4 in Chapter 9, &quot;Integrating EIGRP with other enterprise routing
          protocols&quot; for more details.</li>
</ul>
