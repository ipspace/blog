      </h3>
      <p class="SB" style="mso-pagination:widow-orphan;mso-list:skip">Why did the ping from remote office router to the
      regional server work while the ping from remote office PC to the same
      router failed?
      </p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

      <p>This exercise describes a very common problem encountered in
      connectivity troubleshooting. When you ping a remote destination reachable
      through a WAN or ISDN connection from a router using the standard form of <b>ping</b>
      command, the source IP address in the ICMP packet is the IP address of
      router's WAN or ISDN interface. In the case study, the IP address of the
      ISDN interface of the <i>RO-xy </i>router was reachable by all the routers
      in the network through the <i>RAS </i>router, but the Ethernet interface
      of the same router was not.<h3 style="mso-pagination:widow-orphan;mso-list:skip">Recommendation
      </h3>
      <p class="SB" style="mso-pagination:widow-orphan;mso-list:skip">When troubleshooting connectivity in your
      network, always use extended <b>ping</b><i> </i>command and specify the
      source IP address that you want to use.
