<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>The update packet sent from <i>San Jose</i> to <i>Chicago</i> carries
information about a better route for network 10.1.0.0/16 than the one <i>Chicago</i>
is currently using (128 kbps link to New York). <i>Chicago</i> selects new
successor and informs all other neighbors (<i>New York</i> router) that it has a
better route. It also sends a poison update packet to its new successor - <i>San
Jose</i> router, sending all together <b>two</b> update packets after receiving
an update from <i>San Jose</i>.
