      <p>Find out which route in Fred's routing table
      comes from Wilma, Betty and Barney. Which router is the successor? Which
      router is the feasible successor? How many feasible successor does Fred
      have and why?</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>To find out which router sent a specific entry in EIGRP topology table to
Fred, refer to the &quot;from&quot; field in each entry (colored <font color="#0000FF">blue</font>).
The IP address in the &quot;from&quot; field is the adjacent router's interface
address. To find out which IP address belongs to which router, examine Example
1-8, Example 1-10 and Example 1-13. The IP address of the adjacent router is
shown in the debugging printout and the Example header tells you which router
sent specific packets to Fred. Based on these examples, the interface IP
addresses of Wilma, Betty and Barney are:<br>
      <table class='fmtTable'>
        <tr>
          <td width="50%" bgcolor="#C0C0C0">Router name</td>
          <td width="50%" bgcolor="#C0C0C0">IP address</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">Barney</td>
          <td width="50%">1.0.0.2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">Betty</td>
          <td width="50%">1.1.0.3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">Wilma</td>
          <td width="50%">1.1.0.1</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

<p>The first entry in the topology database thus comes from Wilma, the second
from Betty and the last one from Barney.<p>The topology database printout is
      always sorted by the router's own distance (colored <font color="#800000">brown</font>
      in the printout). The first entry in the topology database always points
      toward the successor, in this case Wilma.<p>Feasible successors are all
      routers with reported distance (colored <font color="#800080">purple</font>
      in the printout) smaller than the router's own distance (colored <font color="#FF00FF">pink</font>).
      Barney is therefore a feasible successor, but Betty is not. Fred has only
      one feasible successor.
