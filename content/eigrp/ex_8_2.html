      <p style="mso-pagination:widow-orphan;mso-list:skip">To improve the EIGRP
      convergence and stability in the network, the network design uses
      hierarchical default routing. Please refer to &quot;Case Study -

      </h3>
      <p class="SB" style="mso-pagination:widow-orphan;mso-list:skip">When the new network design was implemented, the
      number of routes in all routers drastically decreased and the number of
      SIA events was reduced. There were still occasional SIA events, though,
      and the network was still converging slowly. Why? Hint: focus on low-speed
      international links. Simulate what happens when a regional WAN connection
      in Germany fails.
      </p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

      <p>When a regional WAN connection in Germany fails, the <i>Frankfurt </i>router
      will start diffusing computation and query the <i>Austin </i>router, which
      will in turn query all of its neighbors, including the routers reachable
      through low-speed international links. These links slow down convergence
      as every international sales office router has to respond to the query
      before the network convergence is complete. They could also become a
      bottleneck and cause SIA event somewhere else in the network.
