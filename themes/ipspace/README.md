# Ghostwriter

Enhanced port of the Ghost "[ghostwriter](https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter)" theme to the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site generator.

## Installation

Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

```bash
$ mkdir themes
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/jbub/ghostwriter
```

For more information read the official [setup guide](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

## Development

After installing the theme you need to install javascript dependencies. You can use 
`npm` or `yarn` to install them from `package.json`. We are using `webpack` to build
and package styles. In order to develop with realtime reloading in the browser you can 
use this powerful combo:

```bash
hugo server
yarn run watch
```

To update theme styles edit the `styles/style.scss` file. You can then either use the `watch` command
or run `build` to compile the styles:

```bash
yarn run build
```

## Example config.toml

To customize your theme you can use following params:

```toml
baseurl = "https://example.com/"
title = "mytitle"
theme = "ghostwriter"
languageCode = "en-us"
copyright = "My Name"
googleAnalytics = "XXX"
disqusShortname = "XXX"

```

You can also inject arbitrary HTML into `<head>` simply by overriding the `extra-in-head.html`
partial, which is meant for that purpose.
