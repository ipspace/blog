    html: I&#39;m positive there are controllers out there that do what you&#39;re
      describing. However, most startups I see focus on virtual networking in a data
      center, where the situation is drastically different.

  html: I always thought that OP controllers were like SONET EMS systems that the
    operator could either build paths manually in a GUI though a ring or rings or
    the EMS could calculate and automatically provision a path if the operator gave
    the EMS the A and Z ports. Of course SONET networks have very simple topology
    and a strict hierarchy of channel speeds. <br /><br />Perhaps there will be 2
    type of controllers, one for the edge and one for the core. It would be the only
    way to scale, no?

  html: I suppose I am one of those who use the analogy :) I like to use it to point
    out the myth that is also propagated that OpenFlow equals control in the data
    plane. That is just one way to program a data path obviously. Wireless controllers
    are a good example of one aspect of how OF can run in that sort of consistency
    model (CP in DP). Reactive is hard no doubt.<br /><br />I am glad you made it
    clear that reactively pushing rules is only one aspect of programming FIBs with
    OF. The opposite end of the model is leave control out of the DP. Save Packet_Ins
    for page faults. ARPs still go to slow path, but ARPs have always gone to the
    slow path. Load the FIB just like it would with any other protocol. Im not one
    to get hung up on a protocol used to program forwarding, just pick one that can
    be granular and coarse for aggregation/edge much like Antonio&#39;s insight. Stateful
    services with be interesting to watch :) Have you seen anything reactive/stateful
    svcs at relative scale? Some important patches go in the next month so will be
    interested to see the performance outcome. Fun stuff!<br /><br />Cheers Ivan!<br
