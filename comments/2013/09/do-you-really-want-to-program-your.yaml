    html: 'Hmm, let me try to remember some of the crazy things I did when I was still
      young and stupid ... it&#39;s all becoming hazy these days ...<br /><br />*
      Industrial control device drivers for RSX-11M;<br />* Symbolic kernel debugger
      for RSX-11M<br />* Token ring-like file sharing network for CP/M using RS-232
      @ 100kbps or so;<br />* Network file server with Linux-like operating system
      and file system structure for CP/M clients (because I hated flat directory structure
      of CP/M and early MS/DOS);<br />* Transactional database (because there was
      none on MS-DOS);<br />* Scripting language to be able to develop applications
      faster than using dBase or Clipper;<br />* port of sendmail to MS-DOS (you really
      don&#39;t want to know the details) and DECnet (really), IPX and UUCP plugins
      for the ported sendmail;<br />* Email client to go with the mail server (remember,
      these were still pre-Windows days, everything was done on 80x24 terminal screens).<br
      /><br />... and then I stopped doing crazy things and started doing crazier
      things (aka networking).<br /><br />I&#39;m sort-of lazy (programming-wise)
      these days - only did a couple web sites in recent years. '

  html: 'Ivan. I suspect SDN will be great for automation of network provisioning
    also as for creating non-standard network topologies. I think nobody will make
    gui for SDN controller like you describing. SDN will work, but before that somebody
    will make good flexible controller for that.<br /><br />Let&#39;s look at some
    analogies: Wireless started as standalone AP, then standalone AP with some configuration
    tool, then dumb AP with wireless controllers. It likes to SDN, isn&#39;t it?'

  html: SDN is simply opening markets to programmers. It looks like to be good for
    enterprises or for DC...But really a mess for telecom operators..

  html: 'Ivan. It is interesting to build a test lab and experiment with SDN (I would
    highly recommend Mininet for experimenting with SDN - it&#39;s a free emulator
    that allows you to build networks in a VM and connect them to an SDN controller:
    OpenDaylight, Floodlight, Ryu, etc.). I expect that one of the conclusions that
    people will draw from their test lab is that writing production quality SDN applications
    is hard.<br /><br />The real benefit of the SDN movement is that it opens up APIs
    for control of networking products, allowing independent software vendors to develop
    controllers that solve real world problems. Being informed about SDN will allow
    customers to understand the capabilities of SDN and make informed choices when
    selecting solutions.'
