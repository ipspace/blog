    html: My issue here is that so many people seem to think that QoS = More Bandwidth.  It
      seriously bewilders me how people get this in their head.  Smart people too!<br
      /><br />Ok, so if I have a 1Gbp WAN link, no matter what, it&#39;s only going
      to be a 1Gbp WAN link.  I don&#39;t care if you run compression, QoS, CoS, or
      even play with TDM frequencies.  It&#39;s still only going to be a 1Gbp WAN
      link.  Most of the time the only time QoS even comes into play is when there
      is congestion.  Trying to send more over the pipe, at the same time, than its
      capacity.  QoS basically only says, &quot;If the pipe is congested, here&#39;s
      what we send first, second, third, etc.&quot;  Generally the time sensitive
      and PIO (Packets In Order) data (like VoIP) are sent first, followed by whatever
      your company feels is important, and everything else is marked best effort.  So
      if for 5 minutes your web browsing is slow and your Pandora stream stutters,
      oh well!<br /><br />The problem here is that QoS starts out with good intentions.  [Remember
      how the path to Hell is paved!] But in the end winds up causing more problems
      than it really solves.  Over time data priority becomes political within a company
      and as soon as Marketing finds out that you&#39;ve de-prioritized their web
      traffic and they might have to wait 15 mins to download the latest YouTube video
      of some competitors commercial, the IT Director find himself with the CIO sitting
      with the CEO to have a little &quot;Chit-Chat&quot;. This happened because the
      Director of Marketing is the CEO&#39;s cousin and she just got done with the
      presentation on how the ability to watch competitors commercials in real-time
      and without delay saves the company $1.2 Million annually.  Instantly you just
      became the bad guy.<br /><br />Everybody wants their traffic to never be interrupted
      but somebody has to stop and wait if QoS is going to do your network any good
      at all.  Bottom line!

    html: 'I know where you are coming from but all those arguments are easily countered
      when it comes to politics. You present a case as to what has priority and why.
      When they say they want their youtubes, well you present what will have to suffer
      to allow youtubes to load properly. Ultimately it&#39;s not up to the network
      guys for which applications get priority. That&#39;s a business decision. You
      never have to be the bad guy, you leave a paper trail and you follow what your
      superiors tell you to do, even if you know it&#39;s to their disadvantage.<br
      /><br />Also I would suggest reading more on what QoS does. Either you super
      simplified it for the layman or you may not know. I&#39;m going to assume you
      simplified it, if so, please disregard this part of the comment. '

  html: 'As far as I am concerned, the QoS aspect should be fairly easy to solve,
    and not that hard to implement: Classify and mark in the overlay, copy or re-mark
    the same classification in the underlay packet, do what you have to do on the
    underlay (police, shape, queue.) <br /><br />The only issue with that solution
    (I used to work for the military where we had similar model of encrypted overlay)
    is tenants thinking that it is a security risk to have their marking showing to
    other people (I know, it&#39;s a stretch, but I have had that argument before)<br

  html: Thanks Ivan for listing this out. Another question i have is, do we need to
    honor QoS based on VM&#39;s packet or the honoring be based on per tenant basis
    ?.<br /><br />On similar lines, should we honor VM&#39;s TTL ?. If honored, applications
    with TTL=1 would break. If not, possibly of routing loops may arise due to synchronization
    issue between the controller and vswitch.

  html: Thanks Ivan,<br />I am glad I am not the only one who believes that avoiding
    congestion by providing more bandwidth than the servers can consume can be the
    most cost-effective way of handling this.

    \ />Why do we need marking of overlay virtual traffic in TOR switch? maybe classification\
    \ and load balancing on overlay virtual traffic in TOR switch is necessary. But\
    \ I didn&#39;t see why we need marking inner packet? even if you want to remark,\
    \ it should be on outer.<br /><br />Centec Networks is designing a high density\
    \ 10G chip of data center. It DOES support classification and load balancing on\
    \ inner packet, but no marking inner packet."

  html: Good post. Cost of port and WAN bandwidth(?) is going down where as cost of
    a network plumber optimizing the heck out of too slow network is not. Not to mention
    the built-in cost of complex solutions (although this something the industry outside
    of this blog does not talk enough about).
