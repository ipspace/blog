          "html": "My issue here is that so many people seem to think that QoS = More Bandwidth.  It seriously bewilders me how people get this in their head.  Smart people too!<br /><br />Ok, so if I have a 1Gbp WAN link, no matter what, it&#39;s only going to be a 1Gbp WAN link.  I don&#39;t care if you run compression, QoS, CoS, or even play with TDM frequencies.  It&#39;s still only going to be a 1Gbp WAN link.  Most of the time the only time QoS even comes into play is when there is congestion.  Trying to send more over the pipe, at the same time, than its capacity.  QoS basically only says, &quot;If the pipe is congested, here&#39;s what we send first, second, third, etc.&quot;  Generally the time sensitive and PIO (Packets In Order) data (like VoIP) are sent first, followed by whatever your company feels is important, and everything else is marked best effort.  So if for 5 minutes your web browsing is slow and your Pandora stream stutters, oh well!<br /><br />The problem here is that QoS starts out with good intentions.  [Remember how the path to Hell is paved!] But in the end winds up causing more problems than it really solves.  Over time data priority becomes political within a company and as soon as Marketing finds out that you&#39;ve de-prioritized their web traffic and they might have to wait 15 mins to download the latest YouTube video of some competitors commercial, the IT Director find himself with the CIO sitting with the CEO to have a little &quot;Chit-Chat&quot;. This happened because the Director of Marketing is the CEO&#39;s cousin and she just got done with the presentation on how the ability to watch competitors commercials in real-time and without delay saves the company $1.2 Million annually.  Instantly you just became the bad guy.<br /><br />Everybody wants their traffic to never be interrupted but somebody has to stop and wait if QoS is going to do your network any good at all.  Bottom line!",

          "html": "I know where you are coming from but all those arguments are easily countered when it comes to politics. You present a case as to what has priority and why. When they say they want their youtubes, well you present what will have to suffer to allow youtubes to load properly. Ultimately it&#39;s not up to the network guys for which applications get priority. That&#39;s a business decision. You never have to be the bad guy, you leave a paper trail and you follow what your superiors tell you to do, even if you know it&#39;s to their disadvantage.<br /><br />Also I would suggest reading more on what QoS does. Either you super simplified it for the layman or you may not know. I&#39;m going to assume you simplified it, if so, please disregard this part of the comment. ",

      "html": "As far as I am concerned, the QoS aspect should be fairly easy to solve, and not that hard to implement: Classify and mark in the overlay, copy or re-mark the same classification in the underlay packet, do what you have to do on the underlay (police, shape, queue.) <br /><br />The only issue with that solution (I used to work for the military where we had similar model of encrypted overlay) is tenants thinking that it is a security risk to have their marking showing to other people (I know, it&#39;s a stretch, but I have had that argument before)<br />",

      "html": "Thanks Ivan for listing this out. Another question i have is, do we need to honor QoS based on VM&#39;s packet or the honoring be based on per tenant basis ?.<br /><br />On similar lines, should we honor VM&#39;s TTL ?. If honored, applications with TTL=1 would break. If not, possibly of routing loops may arise due to synchronization issue between the controller and vswitch.",
