            <div class="comment-content">Sounds like a really good reason to take a serious look at FCoE, NAS, or iSCSI.  The moral of the story is that there is a significant amount of unused bandwidth in a modern data center that could be used instead of buying a separate storage network.<br /><br />That said, I&#39;m not sure the analysis really accounts for microbursts.  Consider two users accessing a 10 Gbps file share at 1 Gbps client speeds.  While the users may quickly transfer their file and the average utilization of the file server is 100 Mbps over a 1 minute interval, the user&#39;s experience would be wildly different if the server were simply connected at 100 Mbps (or even 1 Gbps) as opposed to 10 Gbps as the users would contend for bandwidth and each transfer would take longer. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">I find this article irritating!  This is a numbers game that disconnected CEO/CFO/CIO dummies use to try and sound smart.  The real fact is that no formula can ever tell you how much bandwidth you really need!  It&#39;s entirely based on every individual company&#39;s situation, and you need to factor in end-user access speeds, replication, DR connections, VPN connections, Application bandwidth uses, Etc... !!!<br /><br />Come On Man!  Write a real article and do some research before you jump on a number game bandwagon to &quot;try&quot; and sound smart.  Those of us who do this for a living can see right through it!<br /><br />-Ciscoman</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The answer is always more. Not so much from a fat pipe scenario, but rather a latency and parallel processing perspective. <br /><br />I have implemented both IB and 10GbE. Both have plenty of bandwidth to move massive amounts of data. But, the IB solution moves those continual little bits much more quickly. Latency is now king.<br /><br />It is similar to death by a thousand cuts. Numerous verbose protocols and applications are leaching the processing power out of infrastructure. The network must be extremely low latency to support this momentary communications.<br /><br />I agree, the majority of use cases are more than covered by 10GbE and 4GbFC when properly engineered. And as prices drop, the standards will continue to rise. Remember the transition to 1GbE? Many systems due to surpass 100MbE today, but the transport and transactional times demand 1Gb+. <br /><br />So, how much do I need? As much as I can afford...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Sorry to be unclear. I was not trying to suggest you have recommended 1GE, rather the bandwidth numbers rarely rise above the bandwidth of 1GE. <br /><br />I believe the greatest benefit from the higher bandwidth technologies is the lower latency.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Great post as always Ivan, I agree and think much of the focus in enterprise needs to be on increasing efficient density across the stack. For me personally the fact that fex&#39;s can and do work in many enterprises, I find that to be a bit troubling and seems a clear indication there is much room for improvement in terms of density and ensuring that enterprises can use the full capacity of the investments they are making. If big web 2.0&#39;s can actually make use of high performance ToR capacity and enterprises can only make use of much less, I think that is a problem, hopefully with time virtualization will have an impact on this as it has had for servers.  And per the other comments it is getting to be much more critical, imho, for enterprises to build monitoring networks and as openflow can make this more economically feasible, hopefully we will see much more deployment of monitoring networks so we can accurately tailor our designs. </div>
