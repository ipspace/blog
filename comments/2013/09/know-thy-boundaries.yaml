    html: Do keep in mind that selecting/buying equipment represents only a very small
      portion of all new things we have to introduce into our networks. I totally
      agree that it&#39;s nice to have someone independent when buying new gear, but
      you don&#39;t need someone vendor-independent to help you (for example) design
      and implement BGP connectivity on your Cisco IOS boxes.

    html: That&#39;s true -- but you might also need to be told that choosing the
      Cisco IOS boxes for your BGP deployment may not be the best idea for your specific
      situation,  and the best decision for your network might be  $Other_Vendor&#39;s
      box;  while the vendor-dependant person is not equipped to alert you of this.

    html: Winner! We need an army of agnostics to take the customer requirements and
      identify the best solution without respect for vendor.

  html: It is difficult to find expertise that is really independent. The companies
    will advise you tou use the product that they have a partnership with. I don t
    find any independent architect here in Switzerland for example.

  html: In software development we are told to analyze the problem domain, not the
    solution domain. From the analysis of the problem we should be guided to the appropriate
    solution. The issue of looking at it for the solution domain is that I now everything
    about vendor X&#39;s box, so how can I leverage it. This is how kludges get built.
    <br /><br />This all stems, I agree, from not knowing or being firm about your
    boundaries. For some reasons the networking people fall victim to this. In many
    cases the network engineer title is a synonym for &quot;jack of all trades&quot;
    but still not as bad as a &quot;system administrator&quot;.
