I think nobody will make gui for SDN controller like you describing. SDN will work, but before that somebody will make good flexible controller for that.<br /><br />Let&#39;s look at some analogies: Wireless started as standalone AP, then standalone AP with some configuration tool, then dumb AP with wireless controllers. It likes to SDN, isn&#39;t it?",

It is interesting to build a test lab and experiment with SDN (I would highly recommend Mininet for experimenting with SDN - it&#39;s a free emulator that allows you to build networks in a VM and connect them to an SDN controller: OpenDaylight, Floodlight, Ryu, etc.). I expect that one of the conclusions that people will draw from their test lab is that writing production quality SDN applications is hard.<br /><br />The real benefit of the SDN movement is that it opens up APIs for control of networking products, allowing independent software vendors to develop controllers that solve real world problems. Being informed about SDN will allow customers to understand the capabilities of SDN and make informed choices when selecting solutions.",
