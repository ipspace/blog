    html: '&quot;IMO this study case could be very interesting topic to complement
      your DMVPN webinar.&quot;<br /><br />Good suggestion. Thank you!'

    html: You get it with the yearly subscription or with the DMVPN Designs webinar.
      Thinking about a separate product, but won&#39;t happen for a week or two.

  html: Very interesting scenario. <br /><br />Regarding this paragraph:<br /><br
    />&quot;While the network designers and operations engineers would have to master
    a new technology (on top of DMVPN) before production deployment of the Internet
    VPN, the reduced complexity of BGP-only WAN design more than offsets that investment.&quot;<br
    /><br />Could you please expand a bit more about the advantages that you see by
    going BGP-only in this case? How this reduce the complexity?<br /><br />IMO this
    study case could be very interesting topic to complement your DMVPN webinar. Specially
    all the design thinking process and caveats during implementation in a practical
    scenario.<br /><br />Thank you!

    html: Interesting approach ... it might sort-of work both with MPLS/VPN as the
      primary transport, and afterwards (change NSSA into regular area).<br /><br
      />However, you&#39;d either need multiple routing processes on hub routers (one
      per site) or it would be impossible to force spoke-to-spoke traffic to go over
      MPLS/VPN (intra-area links are always preferred).<br /><br />I &quot;solved&quot;
      it with three OSPF processes (hub, WAN, spoke) and two-way redistribution and
      although I can make it work (and I&#39;m positive you can as well), it totally
      stinks.

  html: Ivan, great case study!<br /><br />I think that it would be possible to use
    OSPF without creating different processes or injecting additional externals:<br
    /><br />- Area 51 would be totally-stubby NSSA.<br />- CE in Remote site would
    redistribute the routes from BGP to OSPF.<br />- ABR for the Internet connection
    would inject the 0/0 to Remote Site.<br />- ABR for the Internet connection would
    filter the externals generated by the CE in Remote site.<br />- ABR would also
    summarize the routes from Remote Site.<br />- The CE&#39;s at Remote Sites should
    filter the summaries that the ABR&#39;s are generating.<br /><br />The Remote
    Site would prefer the specific externals than the 0/0, which would be used just
    for backup purposes.<br /><br />The Central Site would prefer the routes from
    MPLS/VPN, even though are LSA type 5 and the other ones via Internet are LSA type
    3 due to the longest match rule as well.<br /><br />But,as you said, I see that
    it would easier to use BGP as the WAN protocol.
