      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Excellent write-up as usual and your chordal graphing is impeccable! Of course, we could do without the TR comments :)<br /><br />Couple of points I&#39;d like to make so there is no confusion on why we did this. The statement &quot;programmable optical components remain ludicrously expensive&quot; is not quite accurate. The only difference in the optics from our WDM to our PSI-based solution is the WDM solution uses CWDM transceivers and the the PSI uses non-WDM (FP) single wavelength transceivers. There is a cost differential in these transceivers, but there is no difference in &quot;programmability&quot; (I&#39;ll get to that later). <br /><br />On the notion of cost, while it is true that the PSI solution offers an extremely low cost solution, the WDM solution is still very cost competitive against most traditional networks, especially when compared at like for like over subscription models. The Plexxi WDM solution gives customers a way to affordably build low OSR solutions by optimizing around the applications that require low OSR, rather than having to build the entire network for the worst case, and offers a linear growth model that only ever requires one switch at a time. <br /><br />The PSI version of our solution was driven by customers that loved the concept of Affinities and dynamic photonic networks, but were lured by the *initial* low cost of high OSR leaf/spines, even if they knew that changes in east-west demands would be much more costly down the road. Since they were also buliding uniform pod structures,they did not need the linear growth capability of the WDM solution. So we were able to optimize the solution, with the only tradeoff being that it needs to be grown in fixed increments of a single PSI worth of switches (6 Switches, or about 400 10 GbE ports instead of 1 Switch at a time). <br /><br />On the topic of programmability - just so it is clear - there is no difference in the 2 solutions in this respect. Both WDM and PSI use a fixed pattern of wiring of fibers between switches; the WDM solutions implement the wiring pattern in each Switch, while the PSI solution implements the wiring in the PSI itself, but the pattern is is exactly the same and both are fixed fibers. The programmability comes from the L1 crossbar that is physically on the Switch, in both models, and allows us to create dynamic L1 topologies under SW control.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Mat<br />VP, Product Mgmt, Plexxi",

      "html": "Hi Mat an Ivan,<br /><br />One of you know me a bit, the other I&#39;m hoping to meet.  I am a Plexxi customer and would say I really liked their earliest product.  As Mat points out, this particular product (you seem to understand quite well) is actually a niche design.  When I heard about the PSI, I wasn&#39;t real keen on having that over what Plexxis I already had, for some of the reasons that you pointed out.  You&#39;ve also pegged something their sales engineer have somewhat said, too, in that service mode for less than 5 boxes isn&#39;t ideal.  Four nodes is in my personal book the lowest count I&#39;d run, so that during servicing a switch I wouldn&#39;t drop below 3 nodes.  But, the beauty of Plexxi is how many boxes you can run off of that Chordal ring, with such ease of cabling and excellent visibility of the system thru the latest controllers.  Fairly stated, any mesh or hub/spoke design will have some of the bandwidth issues during service, the nice thing here is cables can run quite far and are extremely simple to connect/manage, unlike a bulk of copper qsfp or dozens of zip cords.  I understand Plexxi has a pan-asian provider with the optics broken out across different localities...<br /><br />Thanks for your excellent posts!<br />Guile<br />",
