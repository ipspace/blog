It&#39;s a unique design and not for everyone, but it has performed flawlessly so far, even during a multicast disruption causing an OTV failure. Not saying it is in anyway a preferred way of designing DMZs, but as tool, OTV has use cases, performs well, and is fairly easy to troubleshoot. Like anything else, it&#39;s a matter of identify risks, mitigating what you can, and determining the overall benefits-versus-risks impact to the organization.",

(Yes, we considered the issue of applications being split between data centers while running in this state).<br /><br />2) Virtual appliances where SRM IP customization does not work. (These same VMs often have no APIs and cannot be scripted).<br /><br />3) Broken VMs where IP customization failed (yes, fixing those VMs would have been better).<br />",

      "html": "question can I create OTV using.... 5k Nexus switches interconnected to ASR 1000?  Or OTV is only supported on 7k switches?  I am in the same shoes situation where we have SRM and i am trying to figure out what is best here, having 5k Neuxus core switches with ASR routers interconnected to 5k Nexus switches for OTV or  simply 7k and if it is 7k then i would like to have FEX functionality but for that I will need F2 module, I am just not sure if i can have F2E  module then down the road buy M2 module and achieve OTV.  I know it all has to be on different VDC etc... but i guess my main question here is can i use OTV with 5k Nexus switches as oppose to getting 7k?",
