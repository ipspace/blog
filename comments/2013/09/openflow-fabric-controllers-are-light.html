            <div class="comment-content">I always thought that OP controllers were like SONET EMS systems that the operator could either build paths manually in a GUI though a ring or rings or the EMS could calculate and automatically provision a path if the operator gave the EMS the A and Z ports. Of course SONET networks have very simple topology and a strict hierarchy of channel speeds. <br /><br />Perhaps there will be 2 type of controllers, one for the edge and one for the core. It would be the only way to scale, no?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;m positive there are controllers out there that do what you&#39;re describing. However, most startups I see focus on virtual networking in a data center, where the situation is drastically different.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I suppose I am one of those who use the analogy :) I like to use it to point out the myth that is also propagated that OpenFlow equals control in the data plane. That is just one way to program a data path obviously. Wireless controllers are a good example of one aspect of how OF can run in that sort of consistency model (CP in DP). Reactive is hard no doubt.<br /><br />I am glad you made it clear that reactively pushing rules is only one aspect of programming FIBs with OF. The opposite end of the model is leave control out of the DP. Save Packet_Ins for page faults. ARPs still go to slow path, but ARPs have always gone to the slow path. Load the FIB just like it would with any other protocol. Im not one to get hung up on a protocol used to program forwarding, just pick one that can be granular and coarse for aggregation/edge much like Antonio&#39;s insight. Stateful services with be interesting to watch :) Have you seen anything reactive/stateful svcs at relative scale? Some important patches go in the next month so will be interested to see the performance outcome. Fun stuff!<br /><br />Cheers Ivan!<br />-Brent</div>
