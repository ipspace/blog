(next Broadcom chipset, or the ones that HP uses in their 7900 series)<br /><br />From my understanding, in this case, only &quot;static&quot; rules would have been pushed from the controllers, and not with each new flow (1:1 NAT, routes to VTEP for each VM, ...)<br /><br />HP seems to push their 7900 as VTEP gateway in datacenters. With their 65k flows (from an example in the docs), it wouldn&#39;t be much of a use if each connection would require a new flow.<br />",
