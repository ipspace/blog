Application resiliency and performance is the goal here.  Why not go with what&#39;s already working in that space.<br /><br />Pay more than $.02 to run your DNS. Protect your DNS from DDoS. Control your own dynamic DNS with a GSLB product that gives granular control and allows you to group FQDNs together to encompass all the required services which make up an application. Include solid IP intelligence (like GeoIP) and reputation based scoring of LDNS or client resolvers. Now we have some BC knobs.   <br /><br />Advanced GSLB is a time proven mechanism for Internet commerce. Turns out it works on the Intranet too. And..look ma.. no new switches needed. ",

It&#39;s like realizing your brakes are too hard to push, so you add a contraption that sits over the brake pedal to make it easier. Then you realize this device interferes with steering, so you add a steering extension to move the control to the other seat. Then you realize you can&#39;t roll the driver&#39;s side window down, so you add a long stick that allows you to manipulate the little switch.<br /><br />Each contraption you add, your friends ooh and ah over the beauty and complexity of the new idea. And all the while, your car is actually becoming undrivable. So you add a car management system... <br /><br />Okay, so I probably shouldn&#39;t be saying these things after just recording a show on LISP, but... There it is.

Wrong. Docker is the new black, apparently. And, interestingly, these &quot;newest&quot; concepts do add the &quot;distributed&quot; nature again. (cf: coreos.com).

You shut down one and bring up another. DNS may or may not be a solution.

These days almost everything is IP, and even broadcasts are used just for ARPs, so no rainbows and unicorns.<br /><br />Those are mostly monstrous financial applications that already cost millions to support. They usually do support clustering, but it could be impossible to hold multiple clusters sharing some common resources, with failover.<br /><br />And storage replication is as low-level as it gets. You always say that problems shouldn&#39;t be moved a couple of layers down the stack. If you&#39;re unlucky, you could get corrupt file systems when doing storage replication at the event of an outage, because it works on block level, it doesn&#39;t even know file systems exist. But link loss during application level replication usually causes loss of only a negligible amount of data. It doesn&#39;t cause corruption.<br /><br />And as I already said, a bridging loop between DCs is painful (although less likely with modern kludges like OTV if implemented properly), it costs money, but if it happens rarely enough, it doesn&#39;t pose a threat to the business itself. A meteorite (fire and malfunctioning extinguishers, loaded truck crashing into the datacenter building, thermonuclear explosion, zombie ourbreak or anything else) does.<br /><br />The tradeoff is &quot;more small incidents&quot; vs &quot;less small incidents, but risk of going out of business after unlikely, but still plausible disasters&quot;.",

SLB using ACE/F5/whatever wouldn&#39;t allow that session replication between nodes. And even if the nodes can communicate via routed L3: you still have a single cluster with nodes in different DCs, with the usual potential caveats like split brain. It just wouldn&#39;t force you to have all the nodes L2 adjacent (but you have to purchase an SLB device).<br /><br />You have to face it: a cluster with nodes spread across DCs, even with L2 DCI, may sometimes be the neatest and safest architecture if you&#39;re considering business survival. And yes, you should probably try to avoid such applications. Life is simpler without them. Most businesses don&#39;t use them, which allows them to avoid complexity and run routing everywhere.",

There&#39;s not always an option to make them better, you just have to live with them, purchase expensive high-end servers instead of loads of cheap machines like Google does etc. These are mission critical applications. You can choose others from the competitors, but they would be the same crap from the admin&#39;s perspective. <br /><br />And so, one day you may realize that implementing OTV with a stretched inter-DC HA cluster at application level could be an option that could once save your business itself. Yes, I know you hate this, but if a meteorite hits one of the DCs and all data inside it is gone forever (that&#39;s probably unlikely, but it has the potential to be fatal for the company), the other DC would continue working almost as if nothing happened. And there could be no other options to replicate data sort-of realtime except for low-level SAN replication which is expensive, kludgy and also dangerous. Consistency is not guaranteed with such techniques.<br /><br />Issues with the stretched clustering itself (split brain caused by loss of the inter-DC link and so on) could be painful, but not fatal. They happen rarely. They could be tolerated - considering them as side effects of the ability to survive the destruction of any DC without having to roll back to nightly backups (which could also be fatal - imagine financial companies).",
