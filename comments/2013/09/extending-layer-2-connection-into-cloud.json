      "html": "Getting OVS in Quantum to use both VLANs and MAC-GRE tunnels just comes down to knowing how to setup OVS to do it. Quantum provider extensions allow you to implement the VLAN while having the MAC-GRE as your default tenant networking scheme.  We used the chef scripts from Rackspace private cloud distro and only had to overwrite attributes to make it work that way. Didn&#39;t need to change the recipe scripts at all.<br /><br />Here is what our OVS plugin config looks like on our compute and network nodes.<br /><br />[OVS]<br />tenant_network_type = gre<br />integration_bridge = br-int<br />local_ip = X.X.X.X<br /><br />enable_tunneling = True<br />tunnel_bridge = br-tun<br />tunnel_id_ranges = 1:1000<br /><br />network_vlan_ranges = ph-eth3:2300:2399<br />bridge_mappings = ph-eth3:br-eth3<br /><br />We setup our VLANs as provider networks (both shared and non-shared).  We use them for both l3_agent based routing (OpenStack software NAT/SNAT) as well as to attached guest instance vifs directly to datacenter VLANs.  <br /><br />You then can use quantum to setup the VLANs with:<br /><br />quantum net-create Net-2301 --provider:network_type vlan --provider:physical_network ph-eth3 --provider:segmentation_id 2301 --router:external true --shared<br /><br />Add some subnets to that network and you&#39;re in business. The subnets can be DHCP enabled. As long as the network nodes are setup with the same VLANs reachable on a NIC like the compute nodes, it launches your dnsmasq instance and it works just fine for guest instances. Just remember that the dnsmasq is hardcoded to a host file so it will not act as a DHCP server for other hosts on the VLAN because their MAC addresses are not on Quantum ports. Of course you don&#39;t have to use OpenStack&#39;s dhcp_agent on the network and you run your own DHCP server on the VLAN external to your cloud.<br /><br />Full Disclosure: I work for f5 networks... so I&#39;m bias to what a real proxy can do in the world!<br /><br />We have f5 BIG-IP VEs with one leg on the SDN (MAC-GRE) and the other on data center VLANs.  We use that for all the fun proxy ADC gateway tricks including SSL-VPN to the cloud resources which only have SDN interfaces. A simple BIG-IP startup script on a KVM instance (reading from Nova metadata) and they boot, license, and set up L2+L3 addressing right from Quantum (excuse me... Neutron) managed networks. It&#39;s ADCaaS.<br /><br />Reach out to me if you want to talk about BIG-IP to BIG-IP tunneling use cases for cloud bridging. While routing through encrypted and compressed iSession tunnels is preferred, BIG-IP has EthIP (L2) tunnelling and IPSEC too. EthIP is how BIG-IP supports LDVM for existing connections with vSphere between data centers (bad idea.. I know).",
