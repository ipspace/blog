            <div class="comment-content">Dedicated to all readers of this website :)<br /><br />This is taken from somewhere on Internet. The name of real write is at bottom:<br />&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />Loneliness, boring hours and silence is for me,<br />meet me I&#39;m the wife of a CCIE-to-be,<br /><br />... Nothing to do but to read the stories of wizards and witches,<br />while my husband stare at his routers and switches,<br /><br />My days have become long and drab,<br />only because he has to give his lab,...<br /><br />To him I wouldn&#39;t look so dull and drony,<br />If only he&#39;d leave alone his IP Telephony,<br /><br />For me, no outing no romance no disco,<br />Ah! How I hate this word &quot;CISCO&quot;,<br /><br />We could better discuss and plan OUR future,<br />but no! He&#39;s more interested in MPLS architecture,<br /><br />I love him with all my heart and body and soul,<br />but he has eyes only for the routing protocol,<br /><br />I have to beg him to take me to a mall,<br />between him and me is always a &quot;firewall&quot;,<br /><br />My good old &quot;Cisco-free&quot; days are lost in a mist,<br />I sure wish I could use his &quot;access list&quot;,<br /><br />My woes are as vast and as deep as a sea,<br />meet me I&#39;m the wife of a CCIE-to-be...<br /><br />-Aleshba Anser (wife of a CCIE #27325)<br />&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;</div>
