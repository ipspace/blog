I totally agree that it&#39;s nice to have someone independent when buying new gear, but you don&#39;t need someone vendor-independent to help you (for example) design and implement BGP connectivity on your Cisco IOS boxes.",

The issue of looking at it for the solution domain is that I now everything about vendor X&#39;s box, so how can I leverage it. This is how kludges get built. <br /><br />This all stems, I agree, from not knowing or being firm about your boundaries. For some reasons the networking people fall victim to this. In many cases the network engineer title is a synonym for &quot;jack of all trades&quot; but still not as bad as a &quot;system administrator&quot;.",
