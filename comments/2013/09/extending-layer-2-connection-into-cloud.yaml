  html: 'I caught the summary of this article in Feedly (&quot;Carlos Asensio was
    facing an &#39;interesting&#39; challenge: someone has sold a layer-2 extension
    into their public cloud to one of the customers.&quot;) and immediately attempted
    to re-enact that scene from Empire Strikes Back by shouting out loud: &quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!&quot;<br
    /><br />Oh and I agree, stretched clusters over a L2 extension with a SPOF sounds
    like a great idea. KABOOM! ;)'

  html: 'Or they can integrate a product like the Nexus 1000V Intercloud.  I know
    you know all about it, but just in case: http://www.jedelman.com/1/post/2013/06/hybrid-cloud-networking-with-ciscos-nexus-1000v-intercloud.html<br
    /><br />Probably a bit more work upfront, but a nice offering to have as a cloud
    provider.'

    html: No reason you can&#39;t use multiple gateways.  Do you really want a SPOF
      anyway? :)

    html: 'Can always have multiple HW GW&#39;s for SPOF but would be expensive. The
      bottle neck with SW solution would probably be performance but It all depends
      on amount of traffic between the DC&#39;s. '

  html: Most of the Hybrid cloud solution available in market seems to be software
    based solution (Intercloud, Cloudswitch, Brocade also has one i believe). So,
    is there a expectation that bandwidth for North-South traffic (Inter/Intra-DC,
    hybrid cloud etc) is less and a software GW is sufficient ?

    html: Not sure it does dynamic MAC learning - it seems you still have to define
      virtualization lookup records with known MAC address and type L2Only.<br /><br
      />Dynamic IP learning - yes, it does that.

  html: 'Getting OVS in Quantum to use both VLANs and MAC-GRE tunnels just comes down
    to knowing how to setup OVS to do it. Quantum provider extensions allow you to
    implement the VLAN while having the MAC-GRE as your default tenant networking
    scheme.  We used the chef scripts from Rackspace private cloud distro and only
    had to overwrite attributes to make it work that way. Didn&#39;t need to change
    the recipe scripts at all.<br /><br />Here is what our OVS plugin config looks
    like on our compute and network nodes.<br /><br />[OVS]<br />tenant_network_type
    = gre<br />integration_bridge = br-int<br />local_ip = X.X.X.X<br /><br />enable_tunneling
    = True<br />tunnel_bridge = br-tun<br />tunnel_id_ranges = 1:1000<br /><br />network_vlan_ranges
    = ph-eth3:2300:2399<br />bridge_mappings = ph-eth3:br-eth3<br /><br />We setup
    our VLANs as provider networks (both shared and non-shared).  We use them for
    both l3_agent based routing (OpenStack software NAT/SNAT) as well as to attached
    guest instance vifs directly to datacenter VLANs.  <br /><br />You then can use
    quantum to setup the VLANs with:<br /><br />quantum net-create Net-2301 --provider:network_type
    vlan --provider:physical_network ph-eth3 --provider:segmentation_id 2301 --router:external
    true --shared<br /><br />Add some subnets to that network and you&#39;re in business.
    The subnets can be DHCP enabled. As long as the network nodes are setup with the
    same VLANs reachable on a NIC like the compute nodes, it launches your dnsmasq
    instance and it works just fine for guest instances. Just remember that the dnsmasq
    is hardcoded to a host file so it will not act as a DHCP server for other hosts
    on the VLAN because their MAC addresses are not on Quantum ports. Of course you
    don&#39;t have to use OpenStack&#39;s dhcp_agent on the network and you run your
    own DHCP server on the VLAN external to your cloud.<br /><br />Full Disclosure:
    I work for f5 networks... so I&#39;m bias to what a real proxy can do in the world!<br
    /><br />We have f5 BIG-IP VEs with one leg on the SDN (MAC-GRE) and the other
    on data center VLANs.  We use that for all the fun proxy ADC gateway tricks including
    SSL-VPN to the cloud resources which only have SDN interfaces. A simple BIG-IP
    startup script on a KVM instance (reading from Nova metadata) and they boot, license,
    and set up L2+L3 addressing right from Quantum (excuse me... Neutron) managed
    networks. It&#39;s ADCaaS.<br /><br />Reach out to me if you want to talk about
    BIG-IP to BIG-IP tunneling use cases for cloud bridging. While routing through
    encrypted and compressed iSession tunnels is preferred, BIG-IP has EthIP (L2)
    tunnelling and IPSEC too. EthIP is how BIG-IP supports LDVM for existing connections
    with vSphere between data centers (bad idea.. I know).'
