How this reduce the complexity?<br /><br />IMO this study case could be very interesting topic to complement your DMVPN webinar.

      "html": "Ivan, great case study!<br /><br />I think that it would be possible to use OSPF without creating different processes or injecting additional externals:<br /><br />- Area 51 would be totally-stubby NSSA.<br />- CE in Remote site would redistribute the routes from BGP to OSPF.<br />- ABR for the Internet connection would inject the 0/0 to Remote Site.<br />- ABR for the Internet connection would filter the externals generated by the CE in Remote site.<br />- ABR would also summarize the routes from Remote Site.<br />- The CE&#39;s at Remote Sites should filter the summaries that the ABR&#39;s are generating.<br /><br />The Remote Site would prefer the specific externals than the 0/0, which would be used just for backup purposes.<br /><br />The Central Site would prefer the routes from MPLS/VPN, even though are LSA type 5 and the other ones via Internet are LSA type 3 due to the longest match rule as well.<br /><br />But,as you said, I see that it would easier to use BGP as the WAN protocol.",
