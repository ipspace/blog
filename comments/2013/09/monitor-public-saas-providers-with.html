            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />We didnt cover this in the presentation in detail, but:<br /><br />#2: we&#39;re actually already developing this feature; we&#39;re gonna start with private ebgp feeds and then move to ibgp; this will be a nice complement to our view since it will tell our customers how they can reach the rest of the world (vs. the opposite) and provide more details about their networks<br /><br />#3: we already detect vpn tunnel entry points in path visualization by looking at mtu decrements; we don&#39;t do the exit point though and your suggestion is worth exploring once we get our hands in device configs<br /><br />#4: we spend a lot of time making sure we reduce alert fatigue and that each alert we send is relevant (versus noise); to your point, we already do baselining of several metrics, including page load, http response time, etc; in addition, we filter alerts for cases when the public agent is experiencing local problems (e.g. lost connection to gateway); im actually writing a blog entry about this last feature soon<br /><br />Cheers, <br /><br />--Ricardo</div>
