  html: I know you&#39;re not a fan, but we&#39;ve been running split DMZs using OTV
    for some time now. It&#39;s a unique design and not for everyone, but it has performed
    flawlessly so far, even during a multicast disruption causing an OTV failure.
    Not saying it is in anyway a preferred way of designing DMZs, but as tool, OTV
    has use cases, performs well, and is fairly easy to troubleshoot. Like anything
    else, it&#39;s a matter of identify risks, mitigating what you can, and determining
    the overall benefits-versus-risks impact to the organization.

  html: Santino, are saying an overlay is easy to troubleshoot? :)

  html: Yes, an OTV overlay is fairly easy to troubleshoot. I am in no way implying
    the applications within the overlay, as they traverse the L3 transport are easy
    to troubleshoot. :)

  html: I am one of the lazy engineers who implemented OTV for SRM.  We had three
    excuses.<br /><br />1) Support for partial failover as most failures are not complete
    site failures.  (Yes, we considered the issue of applications being split between
    data centers while running in this state).<br /><br />2) Virtual appliances where
    SRM IP customization does not work. (These same VMs often have no APIs and cannot
    be scripted).<br /><br />3) Broken VMs where IP customization failed (yes, fixing
    those VMs would have been better).<br />

  html: 'I&#39;ve got pretty much the same requirements as Ryan, though I&#39;m not
    sure I&#39;d call them excuses. #1 on the wish-list is the ability to do a partial
    site fail-over in (for a use case like an array failure)'

    html: OTV works on Nexus 7000 and ASRs. For hardware specific issues (and I know
      they&#39;re still a royal pain) you&#39;d have to check cisco&#39;s web site.

  html: question can I create OTV using.... 5k Nexus switches interconnected to ASR
    1000?  Or OTV is only supported on 7k switches?  I am in the same shoes situation
    where we have SRM and i am trying to figure out what is best here, having 5k Neuxus
    core switches with ASR routers interconnected to 5k Nexus switches for OTV or  simply
    7k and if it is 7k then i would like to have FEX functionality but for that I
    will need F2 module, I am just not sure if i can have F2E  module then down the
    road buy M2 module and achieve OTV.  I know it all has to be on different VDC
    etc... but i guess my main question here is can i use OTV with 5k Nexus switches
    as oppose to getting 7k?
