Not permanent multihoming.<br /><br />Here is an attempt: you make sure the traffic of both ISP prefixes is send to the same router connected to both ISPs.<br /><br />Traffic that arrives at the router can just source route the traffic to the right ISP. I do at home with 2 tunnel providers, works pretty good.<br /><br />The router is a PC-router and pings the other endpoint of the tunnel. And I do use the short TTL and remove the prefix from the RA when a tunnel is down.",

So if your hosts use Linux you could be done, right ? SEND would be interesting too but let&#39;s talk about one problem at a time.<br /><br />So RA has everything that you need, right ? This breaks down if you know that at least Windows doesn&#39;t support the DNS RA-option. So you&#39;ll need DHCPv6 too.",

Nobody mentioned here that source NAT is used quite extensively in corporate networks to ensure traffic is routed back to the source appropriately if there are multiple entrances and traffic crosses firewalls, load balancers, etc.  <br />I suspect that financial organizations paranoid about security will not like idea deploying internal servers on globally routable IPv6 ip-s and put them on ULA. Companies merge quite often and there will be possibility of ULA conflict since all people think similarly and everybody will use fd00:0:0:0::/64 similar to 10.0.0.0/24 :-)  ",
