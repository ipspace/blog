      "html": "From the beginning, the OpenFlow reference implementation and Open vSwitch have supported in-band control, so I&#39;m surprised that there&#39;s no discussion of it here.  I even went to a lot of trouble to document the principles and the implementation: http://git.openvswitch.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=openvswitch;a=blob;f=DESIGN;h=4d654d01d7b140a32e5974f7d0c7a08f6b5aa800;hb=HEAD#l599<br /><br />NVP/NSX use another approach: because everything they&#39;re actually controlling on the physical network is going through a tunnel, they can just use the raw physical network itself for control.",
