  html: The keyword here is &quot;simplify.&quot;  We must define, clearly, what base
    firewall and load-balancer functionality means, then define the data (configuration
    and state) used to manage the firewalls.  Not only will this simplify mgmt, but
    it lends itself to automatability.   Or whatever the right word there is.

    html: In glad you mentioned this as I was about to say the same thing. In curious
      to know how Ivan reconciles the &quot;any web server to any SQL server&quot;
      approach  with the &quot;per service tenant&quot; approach. Perhaps he is talking
      in this context in which case all web servers means &#39;all web servers for
      that particular service&#39; and not &#39;all web servers in your domain?

      &quot;in an appliance-per-application world the rules become simpler&quot;.

    html: My apologies, Ivan, I obviously overlooked that critical  statement. Having
      said that, most security auditors will question why web server X can access
      web sql server Y if thexplicitly require it as they are usually single mindedly
      focused on reducing the attack surface area, regardless of other mitigations
      or other pragmatic considerations.

  html: 'The &quot;simplify&quot; idea is really the key here, the only little problem
    is that it is in direct contradiction to the security/audit team requirements.
    It is them who want to have the fw rules as tight as possible. For example it
    is impossible for them to have one simple rule to &quot;allow all web frontends
    to talk to all sql backends&quot;<br />You might say the exposure will be smaller
    with small per-application appliances, which is true, but still not enough for
    security/audit team. Anything looser is unacceptable for them, so convincing them
    otherwise will be hard. '

    html: I don&#39;t think this will require an &#39;any any&#39; rule, just a specific
      well defined group to be allowed access to another specific well defined group,
      albeit not everything in the first group would need access to everything in
      the second.<br /><br />Despite my comments above, I am very much in favour of
      an approach along these lines. What we are looking at is a step towards this
      goal which is not to have per-service firewalls (at least not yet) but to have
      per-environment firewalls and in some cases, several pairs of firewalls per
      environment. This is a half way house between monolithic firewalls and per-service
      firewalls. We are also using templated rules which get applied to servers when
      needed, rather than a blanket allow rule between web tier and app tier etc.
      <br /><br />One of the issues with per-service firewalls (and this is purely
      a management/housekeeping issue, rather than a technical one) stems from the
      difficulty it is in getting people to agree to decommission systems. Service
      owners like to keep systems running &#39;just in case&#39; or because they have
      re-used them for some other unrelated task. This behaviour often contributes
      to VM sprawl and is likely to lead to firewall sprawl too, with its associated
      licensing and management overhead. But as I say, this is a management issue
      and if you can get to grips with that, then it is no longer a barrier.<br /><br
      />The bigger barrier is the security auditor wanting to reduce the surface area
      of attack and consequently putting the brakes on such a per-service firewall
      deployment with broad rules for comms between server types. Again, I have tried
      to address this by making the case that if a single server has been compromised,
      you have to assume the whole service in that environment has been compromised.
      With such a perspective, it doesn&#39;t matter that the compromised web server
      can access an app server it doesn&#39;t strictly need to because the sysadmins
      focus should be on detection of the incident and locking it down whilst relying
      on other multi-layer security measures to mitigate the impact in the meantime.
      Obviously, any critical service would have redundancy/resilience built in and
      so you would keep the service alive through your secondary system during the
      lockdown of your primary.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think Ivan&#39;s point
      is valid, it just requires all parts of your team (including auditors) to take
      a similar pragmatic approach.

  html: In IAAS systems such as AWS and Apache CloudStack, security groups offer scalable
    isolation like you mention. Instead of virtual firewalls, we can use the hypervisor&#39;s
    firewall capabilities (iptables in Xen/KVM). Apache CloudStack can comfortably
    manage tens of thousands of firewalls and hundreds of thousands of firewall rules
    (see http://www.slideshare.net/chiradeep_v/scalable-networking-in-apache-cloudstack
    slides 32-41)

  html: I feel that security thinking does need to evolve along with the technology.
    The business is pushing for self-service, automation, and instant provisioning
    - and in most cases there is a business driver behind it - so it&#39;s becoming
    a requirement, not a nice-to-have.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been involved in some tire-kicking
    on both public and private cloud for an enterprise. Inevitably, security is running
    around behind the network architecture trying to plug holes. Yes, the developers
    are getting the instant provisioning and shorter delivery times to the market/customer.
    Then an auditor comes in and the security group has to clean up. When they are
    done, some people are frustrated because now they have to follow a process to
    allow new connectivity whereas it used to &quot;just work&quot;.<br /><br />Again,
    I think Ivan&#39;s previous suggestion of making every app a tenant is good. Multiple
    virtual firewalls as mini point solutions can also be good. But here are some
    real challenges:<br /><br />1. Some developers don&#39;t know what all of the
    dependencies of their app are. I can&#39;t tell you how many times they build
    an app, request the firewall exceptions, and spend a week amending them because
    they forgot that this app calls some other middleware piece.<br />2. Virtualized
    appliances are great, but they still are constrained to Layers 1-7, and in many
    cases, still constrained to Layers 1-4. If we are dealing with large, flat networks
    or even huge IPv6 networks, you will have databases, apps, web and other things
    landing all over the IP space. Yes, you can put things in security groups or whatever
    your orchestrator uses to define security policies, but a lot of appliances don&#39;t
    recognize security groups. They still look for this IP talking on this port, etc...
    If the security groups could be tagged and if the appliances understood these
    tags, you could land databases wherever, and have the correct policies applied
    automatically. For most things<br />3. Legacy. Some of these new, whizbang environments
    will contain servers that talk to servers in old, tired legacy environments. We
    see them autoprovisioning in the private/hybrid cloud quickly and automatically...
    then they need it to pull from a data warehouse somewhere and now it&#39;s back
    to the security request.<br /><br />one more time, I think this is the right direction
    but I sincerely think there needs to be some technological breakthroughs before
    we are there.<br /><br />CWB

  html: guys, as everyone knows, money/profitability always comes first. And people
    only think about security when  there has been a huge breach (and even then think
    about it temporarily and then go back to before)<br /><br />&#39;let your app
    team  (or sometimes end user) manage their own firewall&#39; is the principle
    behind all cloud offerings, which is why they are the Largest &#39;Hack Me&#39;
    networks of all time.<br />
