      "html": "Hello, Ivan.<br /><br />Do you have any estimations regarding the number of BGP peers (spokes) per Hub?<br /><br />Some years ago our company designed DMVPN with BGP, but Cisco experts put a veto, because of number of peers we were expecting.<br />We had to go into production with EIGRP that time.<br /><br />Thanks.",
