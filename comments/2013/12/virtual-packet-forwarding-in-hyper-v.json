Question is what if VM needs to talk to outside world? There are two gateways in this setup: 192.168.2.1 and 10.0.0.1. My question is which gateway will be used by the VM if the packets need to reach public internet?<br /><br />Is this setup correct?<br /><br />Thank You,<br />Margrita",

      "html": "You say: &gt;&gt;&gt;two VMs connected to the same VLAN within the same hypervisor would communicate directly (without HNV involvement) and would exchange MAC addresses through ARP requests.<br /><br />This is because, by default, the Hyper-V Virtual Switch is configured in Trunk Mode. Assign a VLAN ID on the Virtual Switch and then you will see the difference.<br /><br />Another point you make is this &quot;Flooded frames, frames sent to unknown MAC addresses, and non-IP frames are dropped.&quot; <br /><br />Are you sure about this? VM gateway will handle non-IP packets.<br /><br />A.",
