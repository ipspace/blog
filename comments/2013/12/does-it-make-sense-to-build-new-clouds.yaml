    html: Check VMware NSX requirements, the prerequisite vSphere license, and its
      pricing. Not everyone will go for NSX ... but if you do have it, overlays are
      the way to go.

  html: "Sorry for my ignorance, but if you have vmware NSX implemented, don\xB4t\
    \ you already have everything you need to use overlays ? what would be a reason\
    \ to not leverage that ? or in other words, why would you use NSX if not to use\
    \ overlays ?"

    html: You could implement self-service with VLANs. There are numerous cloud deployments
      (including many OpenStack ones) doing exactly that. Does it scale? Well, obviously
      not beyond 4K segments. Is it stable? Khmm ... Are people doing it? Sure.<br
      /><br />Keep in mind that things might work even though they aren&#39;t sexy
      or overhyped.

    html: 'Could vs. should...<br /><br />Networks in cloud models need to move toward
      L3 not L2. VLAN segmentation is a limitation and will come back to bite. <br
      /><br />The most mature cloud infrastructures are utilizing the physical network
      as message bus and allowing software endpoints to manage routing/firewalling/segmentation. '

    html: The only requirement for &quot;self service&quot; is programability. I know
      I have built my fair share of multitenant solutions over the past 5 years based
      on automated provisioning.<br /><br />While I consider overlays to be the right
      answer, they are certainly not the only answer.<br /><br />Network programability
      and Overlays often go hand in hand, but they are not the same thing. They all
      form part of the larger Software Defined story.

    html: I agree with you - you CAN solve the problem using other technologies (and
      I know you did, and I talk about your solution in my webinars), but from the
      KISS perspective overlay networks are the right solution (they have the minimum
      number of moving parts).

  html: 'Overlays provide the simplest path toward customer controlled networks. So,
    if only the network team will manage customer networks, then overlays are not
    necessarily required. However, if &quot;self-service&quot; is a core component
    of the offering, then overlays are required. '
