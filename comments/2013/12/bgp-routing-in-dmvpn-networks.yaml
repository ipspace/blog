  html: Hello, Ivan.<br /><br />Do you have any estimations regarding the number of
    BGP peers (spokes) per Hub?<br /><br />Some years ago our company designed DMVPN
    with BGP, but Cisco experts put a veto, because of number of peers we were expecting.<br
    />We had to go into production with EIGRP that time.<br /><br />Thanks.

    html: If you use BGP for Internet access or MPLS/VPN then you hopefully have different
      AS number on each site, so it&#39;s easy to reuse them for DMVPN (where it&#39;s
      best to use EBGP anyway).<br /><br />You might need a transport VRF though.

  html: Is the use of BGP (whether iBGP or eBGP) over DMVPN still feasible when you
    peer with your provider using BGP for WAN routing?<br /><br />It lends itself
    easily to address families/VRFs but the only way I could control my own AS numbers
    was with the replace-as function which feels dirty.
