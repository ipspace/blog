      "html": "MPLS was developed originally as much as an optimization for IP forwarding (avoiding longest-prefix matches in large routing tables, etc.) as to support VPNs.  Or maybe even more so.  FWIW, I find it helpful to have this in the back of my mind when trying to think through what appear to be odd implementation choices and defaults.",

      "html": "This blog item started with a TAC case I created about some routing issues. (I sent this information to the friend you mention ;)).<br />I had some global prefix, let&#39;s say 10.11.12.0/24. This prefix was a connected network on a interface that also had mpls ip enabled.<br />After announcing a more specific route from this /24 in a part of our network, I got complains that this prefix was not reachable from every router.<br /><br />My biggest lesson was that if some packets get encapsulated by an MPLS label, the next P router won&#39;t use the IP routing table to do a route lookup. In the case of a more specific route that is in the routing table, it won&#39;t lookup this route and just do Label Switching.<br /><br />",
