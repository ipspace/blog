  html: 'Hi,<br /><br />Thank you for this interesting post!<br /><br />I have a question
    on a setup:<br /><br />PA: 192.168.2.1,<br />VM1 IP: 10.0.0.8 <br />Gateway: 10.0.0.1
    <br /><br />VM2 IP vNIC1: 10.0.0.1 - connected to virtual switch<br />VM2 IP vNIC2:
    Public IP -  connected to internet<br /><br />VM2 is running as a router.<br /><br
    />I setup necessary routing policy to make sure 10.0.0.1 is pingable from the
    VM1. Question is what if VM needs to talk to outside world? There are two gateways
    in this setup: 192.168.2.1 and 10.0.0.1. My question is which gateway will be
    used by the VM if the packets need to reach public internet?<br /><br />Is this
    setup correct?<br /><br />Thank You,<br />Margrita'

  html: 'You say: &gt;&gt;&gt;two VMs connected to the same VLAN within the same hypervisor
    would communicate directly (without HNV involvement) and would exchange MAC addresses
    through ARP requests.<br /><br />This is because, by default, the Hyper-V Virtual
    Switch is configured in Trunk Mode. Assign a VLAN ID on the Virtual Switch and
    then you will see the difference.<br /><br />Another point you make is this &quot;Flooded
    frames, frames sent to unknown MAC addresses, and non-IP frames are dropped.&quot;
    <br /><br />Are you sure about this? VM gateway will handle non-IP packets.<br
    /><br />A.'

  html: '&gt;&gt;&gt;Send frames with unknown destination MAC addresses to the uplink
    interface.<br /><br />By default, this is not the case unless you have a Type:
    WildcardGateway set in IP routing table. This is how Cisco 1000v and HNV Gateway
    works. WildcardGateway entry is created for each VSID.<br /><br />A'

  html: "&gt;&gt;&gt;Even though it looks like Hyper-V Network Virtualization in Windows\
    \ Server 2012 works like any other L2+L3 solutions, it\u2019s a layer-3-only solution\
    \ between hypervisors and layer-2+layer-3 solution within a hypervisor.<br /><br\
    \ />It has to be like as you said. Without this, you cannot route packets between\
    \ different VSIDs. <br /><br />A"
