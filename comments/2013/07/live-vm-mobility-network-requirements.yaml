    html: That sounds cool, but the moved VM also has an ARP cache. How is that one
      flushed/replaced?

  html: Hello Ivan,<br /><br />From what I&#39;ve seen when playing with LISP ASM
    (host mobility accross subnets), the stale ARP caches resident in other VMs in
    the same subnet are cleared by a gratuitous ARP sent by local XTR devices so that
    on-subnet server to server traffic is then LISP encapsulated.
