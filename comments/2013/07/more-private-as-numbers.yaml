    html: My thinking went along the lines of &quot;current router software probably
      cannot differentiate between 32-bit private and public AS numbers, so the private
      32-bit AS numbers will stay in the AS path&quot;

  html: ". Don\u2019t use the 32-bit private AS numbers if there\u2019s a direct path\
    \ of BGP speakers between your sites and the public internet.<br /><br />why?\
    \ what happens when one router doesn&#39;t understand the large as numbers? or\
    \ is it because they don&#39;t diferenciate a 32bit private as from a 32 bit public\
    \ as?<br /><br />best regards "

  html: Despite there being hate for BGP, I do like it and am glad to see it is still
    evolving.<br /><br />Nice article Ivan.

  html: Having BGP AS for each branch sounds a bit clunky.<br /><br />Why not just
    ignore the ISP that can&#39;t provide a L2 link&#39;s over MPLS and run GRE tunnel
    overlay on ISP.<br />Only IP&#39;s on ISP BGP network is endpoint IP&#39;s, could
    probably even use DMVPN to do it dynamically.<br /><br />Thus treat ISP as if
    they are the internet as well, and run DMVPN everywhere with ospf etc.<br /><br
    />This also protects against Provider Routing problems and black-holes.
