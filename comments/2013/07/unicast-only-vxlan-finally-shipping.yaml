    html: They added no features I mentioned in http://blog.ioshints.info/2012/11/vxlan-is-not-data-center-interconnect.html,
      so from the DCI perspective nothing changed (IMHO).

  html: Multicast is an obvious barrier to doing VXLAN across a DCI such as Carrier
    MPLS. I seem to recall you previously concluded that VXLAN between data centers
    is not ideal. Does this development have any bearing in that regard?

    html: VMware DOES NOT have unicast VXLAN in vCNS (you might get it to work if
      you combine vShield Manager with Cisco Nexus 1000V). <br /><br />What they&#39;re
      telling you is to connect VXLAN interfaces of all servers to the same layer-2
      domain (yeah, that&#39;s totally reliable ;)) - you don&#39;t need IP multicast
      support on routers if the multicast traffic stays within a single subnet.

  html: As for me I&#39;m trying to understand how to implement non-multicast mode
    of VMware Networking&amp;Security Manager&#39;s VXLAN which reffered by statement
    &quot;Configure one VLAN between the two clusters for carrying the VXLAN transport
    traffic. By provisioning one VLAN for transport, the requirement to enable multicast
    routing on the physical switches is eliminated.&quot; of VMware VXLAN Deployment
    Guide. Funny fact is that on the 14th page of guide reader again faces vxlan-sid
    &lt;-&gt; multicast mapping configuration section. My expirience of deployment
    VMWare&#39;s VXLAN implementation is described here:<br />https://communities.vmware.com/thread/470752
