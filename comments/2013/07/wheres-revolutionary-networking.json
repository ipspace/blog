      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I just had a flashback of years of debugging networks to solve poor application performance. Just like overlay proponents stress the point that if you design and scale your underlay, your overlay will have less/none to worry about, so did the developers for their apps assuming that various network conditions are not an issue to be concerned about. Both can be viewed as decoupling... Why do we not want to learn from the past mistakes?<br /><br />I agree that decoupling can bring lots of value, but  when decoupling leads of obscurity, you are just inviting problems.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />David<br />@DavidKlebanov",
