Don\u2019t use the 32-bit private AS numbers if there\u2019s a direct path of BGP speakers between your sites and the public internet.<br /><br />why? what happens when one router doesn&#39;t understand the large as numbers? or is it because they don&#39;t diferenciate a 32bit private as from a 32 bit public as?<br /><br />best regards ",
