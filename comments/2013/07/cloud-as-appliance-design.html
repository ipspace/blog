            <div class="comment-content">Agree with this approach.  It also streamlines operations so network guys and gals don&#39;t have to worry about their *stuff* running on a server that may be running other types of applications.  Being equidistant for all traffic is also nice.  Same design is what is recommended by Embrane.  I believe Cisco CVDs coming soon will be recommending something similar (if deploying virtual services).<br /><br />Going back to your example - <br /><br />In an Enterprise Private Cloud, your cluster of network services VMs would be per-tenant or per-app as an appliance rather than a cloud as an appliance, right?<br /><br />Question usually after that, do you still want and need the DC-wide FW for a broad level of protection - this would be the cloud as an appliance as you describe.  Is this correct?  Just want to clarify.<br /><br />Either way, in reality, you could end up with two-tiers of virtualized network services, but both should have dedicated compute clusters.  What do you think?  <br /><br />The outermost tier still needs greater throughput b/c it would be an aggregation device...a basic HW box may still make sense in the short term due to Layers 8-10, but we all know solutions exist where virtual could be optimized to achieve the throughput far beyond what WAN and Internet connection speeds are (at least in the Enterprise).<br /><br />-Jason<br /><br /><br /></div>
