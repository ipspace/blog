  html: I&#39;d love to read both (as well as his third book &quot;blah blah blah&quot;),
    but like everyone else, time is finite and of limited quantity these days. If
    you were to recommend one, which would it be? I&#39;m most interested in how to
    create effective drawings versus needing to be sold on why drawings are effective.
    Any thoughts would be appreciated in this context. Thank you.
