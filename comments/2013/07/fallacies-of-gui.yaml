  html: That sounds to me less like a case for a better GUI on the network devices
    themselves, and more for a halfway decent network-wide orchestration system.  SDN
    is relevant in this context, but only as an alias for &quot;configuration API&quot;
    - someone out there still needs to write a decent big-picture system to tie all
    of the pieces together.<br /><br />Personally, I&#39;d put my money on a more
    generic configuration framework, something like what you can do with ansible on
    Junos, allowing admins to define their *own* tools and workflows becoming useful
    long before another &quot;Enterprise Ready!&quot; 8,000lb gorilla turnkey solution
    can do more than the top 10 workflows of the top 5 customers.

  html: Well, I think there is some value to GUIs, but not because they happen to
    be graphical.<br /><br />For whatever reason, GUIs tend to have more abstraction
    than CLI. There is nothing inherent in the interface that suggests that has to
    be the case, but I think the mindset is different. &quot;I am making this GUI
    to make it easier, therefore I will think through how to simplify.&quot;<br /><br
    />Where the GUI just exposes knobs, it is usually built on the same underlying
    config, so the GUI and CLI will be necessarily the same. But where the GUI provides
    the abstraction you talk about, that can be powerful. <br /><br />The question
    we ought to be asking is if that abstraction is available from the GUI, why not
    make it available in the CLI as well? I know it is not entirely apples-to-apples,
    but the point is that there are ways to do it in both.<br /><br />-Mike Bushong

  html: Vague statements about a &quot;GUI&quot; making things better are based on
    the felonious assumption that GUIs are inherently better than CLI.  Anyone who
    has been breathing in the IT space longer than a few years will have long since
    grown past such assumptions.<br /><br />That doesn&#39;t mean some great tool
    with a great GUI that takes care of some hard bits won&#39;t ever exist.  I&#39;m
    just saying &quot;GUI&quot; doesn&#39;t automatically mean &quot;better.&quot;  <br

  html: GUI provides density of information that can hardly be implemented in CLI.
    A live traffic graph on an interface or a queue is far more natural than a stream
    of numbers in a terminal because it immediately communicates both the amount of
    traffic and percentage of link utilization - something very difficult to do with
    text only. I find tweaking QoS queues while at the same time looking at the live
    traffic graph to see the result raises my productiviy significantly.<br /><br
    />GUI wizards help make sure one doesn&#39;t forget to set any important parameters
    in the first run. Hence, I can be sure my apprentice will configure a PPPoE server
    without forgetting to set DNS parameters - GUI will not let her click Next before
    filling out these fields. After doing this a dozen times she will figure out that
    it&#39;s faster to copy&amp;paste CLI config for new deployments which is a nice
    side benefit.<br /><br />We use IOS for core routing, but a lot of Mikrotik stuff
    for access and PE. Mikrotik is surely not suitable for heavy-duty core stuff,
    but their Windows GUI is a great example of how a useful GUI should be developed.

  html: 'We have both Cisco ASA and Checkpoint Firewalls.  I love the Checkpoint GUI
    for rule base administration and log analysis. It&#39;s the only reason to buy
    Checkpoint in my opinion, not the reliability, not the hardware, not the support,
    not the value for the money.  But down in the weeds - the CLI of a checkpoint,
    things get sticky and that&#39;s where the real CP cowboys play.<br /><br />ASA&#39;s
    on the other hand - the GUI is a poor attempt at making an ASA as friendly as
    a Checkpoint.  The GUI is NOT intuitive, frustrating, and basically nothing more
    than a Graphic interpreter of CLI commands (you can even turn on the option of
    looking at the CLI that the GUI is about to enter for you).  Most telling is when
    calling TAC for an ASA, the TAC engineers NEVER use the GUI for analysis and troubleshooting.<br
    /><br />I think GUIs are nice and have their place (Windows) but CLI is where
    the real power is. '

  html: Juniper partially did this years ago with NSM. I was able to select 5 SSGs
    and create a mesh VPN through a GUI. In 10 minutes all sites could route between
    each internal LAN. <br /><br />I believe the bigger issue is that if network management
    is simplified, the cost will drop. No longer will Cisco/CCIE be billable at the
    current rate. How hard can it be to register all devices to a central system,
    provide a graphical layout of the environment, and then define routes, ACL, QOS,
    etc. The answer, job/pay protection (like lawyers). <br /><br />SDN is seeking
    to address this. If we can build physical servers and storage, databases, email
    systems, content management systems, customer relationship management systems,
    and much more at the click of a button...<br /><br />

  html: Beginners could benefit of a GUI under the very strict requirements that such
    will produce exclusively CLIs for them to use, rather than &quot;applying&quot;
    the change on the system (semi-ASA implementation). It would be like a notepad++
    for a  CLI veteran, who preps his work offline, but with the added benefit of
    ability of checking syntax against a real system which the GUI fronte ends, thus
    has access to verifying validity of changes needed to be applied. So the GUI would
    be a *sort of* front end network OS IDE ... with the latter term, come to think
    about it, possibly becoming relevant, when moving to SDN ;-)

  html: Check out Cisco&#39;s Prime Infrastructure for IP NGN. Watched a demo at Live2013
    in London and was bowled over by the sexiness :)<br /><br />Certain assumptions
    are made, of course, but it&#39;s a start.

    html: You know what&#39;s best of both worlds? Extracting config section and opening
      it in a text editor. <br /><br />F5 does that (not sure about Junos) and it&#39;s
      absolutely fantastic. Imagine doing that for ACL or FW ruleset.
