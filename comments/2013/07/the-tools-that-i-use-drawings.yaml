  html: 'Have you tried the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1? I believe that its digitizer
    and stylus are licensed from Wacom. I use it for work to take notes, and sketch
    diagrams. Notes can be shared directly to Dropbox. '

  html: Draw.io, for the win! Integrates with Google Drive. Has all the Cisco icons.
    Absolutely my fave.

  html: Check out Notability. It has a brush style similar to Paper and adds drawing
    features like doodle selection with copy/paste - so you can duplicate a router
    doodle over and over - and text boxes. It also syncs with the major cloud storage
    players.

    html: I don&#39;t think I ever did that. If I&#39;d want to do it for whatever
      reason I&#39;d probably export them as PNG (so I&#39;d get background transparency)
      from wherever and then import PNG files into Sketchbook.

  html: Hi Ivan;<br /><br />Thanks for sharing the details. May I please ask you as
    to how you imported router symbols to sketchbook pro? Was it directly from visio
    stencils?<br /><br /><br />Thanks
