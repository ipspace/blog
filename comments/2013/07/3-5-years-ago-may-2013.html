            <p class="comment-content">What are your thoughts on IPV6 to IPV6 NAT?  <br /><br />There are obvious security-related concerns including:<br /><br />Giving an attacker the MAC OUI which is useful in network reconissance attacks.<br /><br />Enabling Traffic Footprinting in MITM Attacks.<br /><br />Hardware failure issues; if you&#39;re running a smaller environment and have Load balancer, Firewall, and other rules that tie to a specific specific address, if a NIC fails you may be forced to change the config on a dozen different systems.  There&#39;s an argument to be made for abstraction using DNS but in most instances that&#39;s probably a bad idea.<br /><br />Etc Etc.<br /></p>
