      "html": "For the benefit of everyone who is trying to research where certain features are supported...<br /><br />The Cisco feature navigator is very inconsistent when it comes to IPv6 features. And it gets very complicated when you start talking about supported features on platforms like the Cat3k switches where there&#39;s many different models supporting many different models. This is the best link I&#39;ve found to use to determine what code levels features are supported in (and just to research what the features are):<br />http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Cisco_IOS_IPv6_Feature_Mapping#IPv6_Features<br /><br />This is a relatively good link to look up what features are supported in NX-OS code levels. (though its mostly pertinent to the 7k and mds)<br />http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Cisco_NX-OS_IPv6_Feature_Mapping<br /><br />Lastly, if the above two links don&#39;t cover it then the best place to look is software release notes. You can generally start with the latest code version (within your train) and look in the release notes to see when a specific feature was introduced into that train.",
