            <div class="comment-content">What you write here conflates a few things together that perhaps shouldn&#39;t. <br /><br />1) if your network is dedicated to iSCSI, then by all means use delay based congestion mechanisms and lossless notifications like ECN.<br /><br />2) if it isn&#39;t, you are in a world of hurt with competing with other forms of TCP. <br /><br />3) I&#39;d be very interested in a similar plot of an iSCSI network with fq_codel enabled, as well as a measurement of latency on your disk storage nodes under these loads with both the the lossless and fq_codel based approach. While throughput is important, high latencies cause other problems. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">#1 - Agreed<br /><br />#2 - PFC + ETS giving iSCSI traffic guaranteed part of the bandwidth (ex: 3 Gbps on a 10 Gbps link) is pretty much equivalent to #1.<br /><br />#3 - Me too ;)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I am curious whether there really is a simple answer to this seemingly simple question.<br /><br />I have had some discussions at Cisco Live London around this topic after attending the &quot;Mastering Data Center QoS&quot; session (https://www.ciscolive365.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=6028).<br /><br />Another factor that came into play was whether the switched network was just a single hop or multi-hop between the servers and the storage.<br /><br />Enabling PFC on a multi-hop network could introduce head-of-line blocking on the inter-switch links. To stick with your analogy: If a single elephant is slowed down, then other elephants might be prevented from crossing the bridge between the switches.<br /><br />In the end the recommendation that I got was not to enable PFC on multi-hop iSCSI networks, because the harm done by head-of-line-blocking could outweigh the benefit of using PFC. One of the participants in the discussion actually claimed he had seen a significant performance improvement after disabling flow-control on their iSCSI network. Unfortunately I haven&#39;t seen hard evidence of this theory.<br /><br />I am interested to hear your opinion on this. Could the answer to this question be different for single-hop vs multi-hop DCB-enabled networks?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Yeah, HoL blocking is the biggest elephant in the room, and the risk of encountering it definitely increases with the network size and port speed mismatch.<br /><br />So far, all I&#39;ve heard are theories. Hard facts would be nice, but I haven&#39;t found them yet.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The performance when packets drop very much depend on the TCP/IP stacks used that are involved.<br /><br />Tweaks in recovery algorithms like proportional rate reduction for TCP (rfc6937) good have a big impact.<br /><br />Also the test with 4 equal flows might not be as realistic as you might want them to be.</div>
