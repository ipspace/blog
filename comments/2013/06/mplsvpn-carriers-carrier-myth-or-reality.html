            <div class="comment-content">I have a different perspective, the opposite one - The fact that all major vendors support this feature means it has traction. the days where you released a feature in order to get traction are (nearly) over. today, the major carriers dictate most of the features and vendors follow to get deals. you can ask any PLM at any vendor how many features are postpone or cancelled because of business drivers.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I do not know about any real implementation.<br />But I believe such implementation must exist in large countries like US and Russia, where even large MPLS service providers cannot cover whole country with private optics, and are forced to lease lambdas or use other SPs VPN services.<br />Certainly, layer2 VPNs will be much simpler solution for this situation, but again, for large SPs it can be an awful lot of point-to-point L2 VPNs, while VPLS will have a lot of drawbacks, so L3 MPLS VPN+labeled BGP with Carrier SP would perform best.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">It&#39;s not that &quot;most of the transit providers prefer offering VPLS (or other EoX) services&quot; but rather that it is way easier to sell Ethernet services (which are really *implemented* as VPLS or EoX, but that is transparent to the customer).<br /><br />From a network operations view, L3VPNs in general are much easier for the SP NOC to troubleshoot with the customer since the CE and PE do exchange some NLRI which can be viewed by both the SP and the Customer NOCs.  Most customers do not really have the ability to troubleshoot Ethernet services due to both lack of knowledge and tools (and the belief that Ethernet just magically works). This situation could be improved if both customers and service providers used CFM as a diagnostic tool, but I have yet to see this in the real world either.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I am personally responsible for designing the customer side of a CSC network to interconnect 10 POPs for our network. Used correctly, it can be a very strong design.<br /><br />1. The POPs will have some hefty multicast flow requirements between one another, making VPLS a poor option for the core carrier.<br /><br />2. CSC is very easy from a conceptual perspective. Its actually easier for us to implement CSC than if the carrier provided us a L2VPN. If they did that, I would either have to create a new IGP process for inter-POP communications, or use area 0 in across the world with non-area-0 in each POP (something like that). Then, I would have to either use seamless MPLS or leak PE loopbacks across IGP boundaries ... note that seamless MPLS and CSC are almost identical designs, except the former is for an intra-AS design :)<br /><br />3. Maximum isolation of failure domains. I can add a new POP later, run eBGP+Label with the core carrier, and there is no significant change to the other N-1 POPs notwithstanding the BGP routes they&#39;ll learn from the newly-added POP. With VPLS, assuming I extended IGP across the globe, that changes a bit. Customer also has a stiff requirement for isolation since failures in a POP should minimally affect other POPs.<br /><br />4. Label filtering is a breeze. I only want to allocate BGP labels for my PE loopbacks, while aggregating the networks of my POP transit links into something coarse (like a /16) so I can still have full IP reachability to assist my operations staff with troubleshooting. I suppose this is also true for LDP, but I only need to manage it at a single exchange point, rather than a big broadcast segment with many peers.<br /><br />Moral of the story is that just because a service is not commonly offered does not mean it lacks value. Likewise, just because something is popular/hyped-up does not mean it has value. Thanks Ivan for the great conversation :)<br /><br />-Nick</div>
