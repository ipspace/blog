      "html": "I think what you presented was quite neat. (Just got to love MPLS!)<br /><br />All though I would still suggest using simpler topologies and overriding the &quot;external BGP&quot; winning &quot;internal BGP&quot; routes with setting local preference for some to incoming prefixes from the &quot;WAN&quot;. Then you can have simple iBGP between the two CE routers and external BGP peer towards the operator(s).<br /><br />... at least for me this makes the most sense.",
