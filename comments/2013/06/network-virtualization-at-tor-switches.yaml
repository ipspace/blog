  html: Sadly, we still run SNA over IPX around here. And we can&#39;t get rid of
    it, much to my dismay and troubles that ensue.

  html: Pluribus Networks provides network virtualization at the TOR switch without
    using overlays or tunnels. Segmentation is done using VLANs (with EVB support)
    or VXLANs, with optimal forwarding of L2/L3 at TOR, with multi-tenant support
    for dynamic routing protocols and NAT. It can also be managed as a single switch
    fabric.<br />

    html: That&#39;s exactly right, but to *simplify* things for the server guys,
      maybe network vendors will promote VxLAN overlays as full mesh between TOR devices.  This
      could offer so-called visibility in parts of the physical network.<br /><br
      />Complexity shifts to a virtual switch layer or TOR layer.  Based on who is
      selling it may dictate which is recommended!

    html: And who will provision VLANs on server-to-ToR links and VXLAN gateways on
      ToR switches ... all based on VM mobility? Why do you think it makes sense to
      create a Rube Goldberg machine when a simple one exists?

  html: I thought the use case for VxLAN at TOR by vendors such as Arista was to connect
    native servers and things that don&#39;t support VxLAN natively. Could also be
    used as ingress/egress for a virtual lane in the case you wanted to hook a firewall
    to a virtual switch.

    html: I never claimed the innovation should cease, there are plenty of opportunities
      for innovation in well-structured L3 data center networks, just look at what
      Arista is doing or how Petr Lapukhov built a DC network based on BGP. I&#39;m
      just stating which potential solutions make no architectural sense to me based
      on what I&#39;ve seen work and fail in the past.<br /><br />Please feel free
      to totally disagree with and prove me wrong ... in which case you might decide
      to stand behind your ideas and stop begin A.Anonymous.

    html: Well I started out anonymous so should probably stay that way for this one.<br
      /><br />There are functions I too don&#39;t believe belong inside the core network,
      like conversation-based network services.  But the core network fabric should
      continue to innovate in the areas of capacity, scalable address-based connectivity
      as well as scalable multi-tenancy (QoS &amp; network virtualization) -- even
      down to the ToR.  Multi-tenancy support in the ToR enables possibilities much
      broader than just DC.

  html: OS-X on this apple laptop isn&#39;t running in a hypervisor, and that&#39;s
    just one example.  Why must innovation in the data center core network cease while
    the world figures out how to put a trusted hypervisor in every device out there?

  html: "&quot;let\u2019s transport IP over APPN (or maybe it&#39;s just one of the\
    \ recurring nightmares I&#39;m having)&quot; That brings up good (?) memories...\
    \ In the 90&#39;s, I installed a WAN for 15 sites with 56kbps frame relay links,\
    \ and the &quot;routers&quot; were IBM&#39;s 2217s, doing just that (encapsulating\
    \ IP inside APPN). A few years later these were replaced by 2210s, true IP routers..."
