  html: I just love periods of flux like this though :-) I&#39;ve been around long
    enough to see most if not all the missteps you mention. It just makes me laugh
    and rub my hands with glee!

  html: There are some of us old timers that started off with X.25 and have LANE on
    our gag reel that intend to solve this in a way that will stick.<br /><br />No
    offense to those making a living consulting cleaning up perpetual architectural
    and implementation mistakes :-)

    html: '... or we may all start using things like OpenStack on KVM, or Cisco succeeds
      in persuading you to use NX1KV everywhere. <br /><br />I don&#39;t care who
      wins as long as we keep decreasing the overall complexity.'

    html: Let&#39;s hope it is the user/customer/operator that wins.<br /><br />That
      is the one I care about ;-)

  html: So are you saying that eventually server virtualization companies(VMware,
    Microsoft..) are going to win this game as clearly they have an edge of owning
