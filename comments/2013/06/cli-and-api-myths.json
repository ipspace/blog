      "html": "Great post. You&#39;re correct that APIs and CLIs are doing the same thing behind the scenes. This does mean that as a configuration interface there&#39;s not much to choose. However, there is one advantage in APIs relative to CLIs for &quot;show&quot; commands - APIs have the potential to provide more structure in the output compared to traditional screen scraping.  In that sense JSON-over-SSL is more than just eye candy.",

      "html": "Agree with Anonymous.  But there is a difference also for config; the CLI is often irregular and does not have a formal description of its commands.  Furthermore, different vendor&#39;s CLIs have different semantics in their commands.  With an API the operations are usually well defined, even if vendors have proprietary content (data models).",

They know this, and thus, they will gladly develop SDN as a feature to make their equipment work better, but will certainly build kinks when making it work with competitors kit which is both good and bad.  When all is said and done, you can expect vendors to step in and build middle-ware to support everything except for the bleeding edge, and companies will jump on it as a value-add with caveats.",

      "html": "Lots of stuff to comment on here. The comment thread alone is interesting. <br /><br />Why should this be different this time around? I think the problem with network management in the past has been that it is inherently customized to each customer, which means the cost to customize it is quite high. This brings down the margins as cost-per-sale goes up. Which means that the best return on an incremental dollar of investment is spent somewhere other than network management.<br /><br />If, however, there is less customization (because the network abstraction is done better), you should see higher ROI, which would mean the cost of sale would be better. This could be a way to help buoy margins when hardware continues to decrease (and would be part of an overall shift to monetizing software).<br /><br />Which brings me to the comment about hardware being the thing. I think that is a little bit lazy. The thing has never been hardware - it is sales. As long as solutions are monetized primarily on hardware, you get the behavior described. If monetization shifts more to software, you will see different behavior.<br /><br />-Mike (@mbushong)<br />Plexxi",
