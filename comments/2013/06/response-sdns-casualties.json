          "html": "Actually, VMware did downsize the server team. As the consolidation ratios rise, server teams are managing more instances with fewer personnel. A few years ago, the admin to instance ratio was 1:10. Now it is closer to 1:100 (or some are even higher). It also drove the skillset up the ladder allowing virtual administrators to pick up roles in storage and networking. <br /><br />Networking will be pruned to a certain degree - partially form improved technology and partially from the &quot;sharing&quot; of duties with other teams. <br /><br />Good point on the wireless controllers. They have a working SDN implementation to which datacenter networking is headed. ",

In the wireless LAN, I think architectures using Centralised Wireless controllers with protocols like CAPWAP look very much like SDN - and they have been around for some time. I guess that&#39;s missed opportunity for the marketing folks to name them Wireless SDN (wSDN).",

      "html": "@Anon<br /><br />There is actually a difference between an explicit downsize and a more favorable employee to device ratio. The total number of whatevers (VMs, networking devices, whatever) continues to climb in absolute terms. Despite several rounds of convergence, this macro trend remains true. <br /><br />Similarly, despite new technology trends, the absolute number of people to man these devices continues to rise. <br /><br />SDN should mean the two (devices and people) shouldn&#39;t have to grow at the same rate, but that is actually a different point than suggesting an industry-wide reduction in force. Such a workforce action is difficult to take for a lot of reasons, the least of which are technical. <br /><br />Rather than frame the discussion around who will lose their jobs (people will retire and self-select out over time anyway), I&#39;d rather focus on who will make a killing because they are evolved. I do think a DevOps person with networking engineering knowledge will cash in. They should have first mover advantage in a changing workforce.<br /><br />-Mike (@mbushong)<br />Plexxi",

It just means there will be less people thinking you&#39;re an idiot for taking so long to deploy a machine.<br /><br />(2) A good deal of time is actually spent by network operators in trouble shooting application problems.  Most app folks don&#39;t [want to] know anything about what happens after their program calls an API for service.  There will always be a need for specialists that understand what happens between the program on one end and the program on the other.  <br /><br />(3) When your SDN ain&#39;t working, it might be a good insurance policy to have a specialist on hand.<br /><br />(4) SDN may actually mean fewer jobs for project managers involved in deployment management rather than fewer network specialists.  Most shops hardly had enough network specialists in the first place.<br /><br />(5) I personally don&#39;t know any network engineers that only provisioned vlans so I think most network engineer jobs are quite safe.  If all you do is program vlans, then you&#39;re probably really a server admin.  ;)",
