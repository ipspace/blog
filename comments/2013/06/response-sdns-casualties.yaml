    html: 'Actually, VMware did downsize the server team. As the consolidation ratios
      rise, server teams are managing more instances with fewer personnel. A few years
      ago, the admin to instance ratio was 1:10. Now it is closer to 1:100 (or some
      are even higher). It also drove the skillset up the ladder allowing virtual
      administrators to pick up roles in storage and networking. <br /><br />Networking
      will be pruned to a certain degree - partially form improved technology and
      partially from the &quot;sharing&quot; of duties with other teams. <br /><br
      />Good point on the wireless controllers. They have a working SDN implementation
      to which datacenter networking is headed. '

  html: New technologies will most likely contribute to job growth, not loss; as you&#39;ve
    pointed out, the key is to adapt.<br /><br />VMware did not cause a downsize in
    the server team for most companies - rather there is a shift in focus - instead
    of spending time rolling out big irons, they optimise, monitor and find new ways
    to use the scalable virtualised environment now, with the same or increase in
    the number of staff.<br /><br />SDN, in time to come, is going to achieve the
    same thing - instead of folks rolling out physical switches, they will spend most
    of their time monitoring, optimising and finding new ways to use the network.<br
    /><br />p.s. In the wireless LAN, I think architectures using Centralised Wireless
    controllers with protocols like CAPWAP look very much like SDN - and they have
    been around for some time. I guess that&#39;s missed opportunity for the marketing
    folks to name them Wireless SDN (wSDN).

  html: '@Anon<br /><br />There is actually a difference between an explicit downsize
    and a more favorable employee to device ratio. The total number of whatevers (VMs,
    networking devices, whatever) continues to climb in absolute terms. Despite several
    rounds of convergence, this macro trend remains true. <br /><br />Similarly, despite
    new technology trends, the absolute number of people to man these devices continues
    to rise. <br /><br />SDN should mean the two (devices and people) shouldn&#39;t
    have to grow at the same rate, but that is actually a different point than suggesting
    an industry-wide reduction in force. Such a workforce action is difficult to take
    for a lot of reasons, the least of which are technical. <br /><br />Rather than
    frame the discussion around who will lose their jobs (people will retire and self-select
    out over time anyway), I&#39;d rather focus on who will make a killing because
    they are evolved. I do think a DevOps person with networking engineering knowledge
    will cash in. They should have first mover advantage in a changing workforce.<br

  html: Some more good news for network engineers.<br /><br />(1) Someone still needs
    to build the underlay network -- SDN doesn&#39;t mean there will no longer be
    boxes, ports and wires.  It just means there will be less people thinking you&#39;re
    an idiot for taking so long to deploy a machine.<br /><br />(2) A good deal of
    time is actually spent by network operators in trouble shooting application problems.  Most
    app folks don&#39;t [want to] know anything about what happens after their program
    calls an API for service.  There will always be a need for specialists that understand
    what happens between the program on one end and the program on the other.  <br
    /><br />(3) When your SDN ain&#39;t working, it might be a good insurance policy
    to have a specialist on hand.<br /><br />(4) SDN may actually mean fewer jobs
    for project managers involved in deployment management rather than fewer network
    specialists.  Most shops hardly had enough network specialists in the first place.<br
    /><br />(5) I personally don&#39;t know any network engineers that only provisioned
    vlans so I think most network engineer jobs are quite safe.  If all you do is
    program vlans, then you&#39;re probably really a server admin.  ;)

    html: Hard to find the product/application detail on the web, but HP has the &quot;Sentinel&quot;
      SDN application that turns the network into a distributed botnet filter and
      denies at the campus access layer if trying to go to rogue/malicious websites.  Switch
      redirects DNS requests (OF matching on port 53) to Tipping Point IPS, or there
      is some back end integration somehow, and validates DNS requests on ingress
      to network rather than at Internet Perimeter.  <br /><br />Distributed policy
      enforcement at the edge...in the campus.<br /><br />Sounds like a solid app,
      but not sure I&#39;d call it an &quot;SDN Campus Solution.&quot;<br /><br />-Jason

    My definition of &quot;rolled out product&quot; is something that is documented
    (including data sheet/install/config docs) on vendor&#39;s public web site.<br
    /><br />Networking/Technology/SDN path on HP web site brought me to this page:<br
    /><br />http://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/networking/solutions/technology/sdn/index.aspx#tab=TAB4<br
    /><br />... where the only &quot;SDN&quot; management product listed leads me
    to an IMC plugin, which can provision ToR switches based on VM information gleaned
    from VMware.

  html: There is some interesting research showing a decoupling between job growth
    and productivity:<br />http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/515926/how-technology-is-destroying-jobs/<br
    /><br />In the last decade, productivity continues to increase while job growth
    is not. <br /><br />This leads me to believe, that supplanting network engineer
    jobs (that spend the bulk of their time manually provisioning configurations that
    will be handled by SDN type solutions) with new SDN engineer jobs will not necessarily
    mean more jobs will be created. It&#39;s very probable that fewer network related
    jobs will be created, due to the efficiencies and increased productivity gains
    from future SDN solutions.
