          "html": "OK -- I thought that&#39;s what you meant until I saw the part with vrouter peering with ToR.  At that point I was thinking PaaS DC vs IaaS DC.  I probably shouldn&#39;t have rushed my reading.<br /><br />I agree that using MPLS for the transport tunnel is not ideal for the DC.  Implementations of EVPN and VPNv4 in the works for the DC will let the NVE advertise the set of encapsulations that it supports.  This allows gradual migration from one encap to another as encaps themselves might evolve.  This also makes it much more possible for seamless network virtualization across different NVO3 domains so long as both ends support the address family and have a supported encap in common.<br /><br />I&#39;m a proponent of MPLS over GRE where an NVE advertises via MP-BGP locally significant MPLS labels per context or even per NLRI.  These labels can be used to identify local tenant context or apply whatever special action the egress NVE wishes to apply against an advertised label.   With locally significant labels the context ID is not condemned forever to the one role of creating a flat virtual network.  Locally significant context ID also enables very flexible topologies, and even takes the number of virtual networks from 24M to something that is a function of the size of BGP route targets and the number of NVE.  If route target size increases, so does the number of virtual networks, without any change to the data plane.  You could choose to fix use globally significant labels or even split the label space into local and globally significant.<br /><br />What did the folk at the large-scale cloud DC tell you that convinced you?  I&#39;d like to believe as well, but haven&#39;t seen anything that works for everyone versus just for monolithic large cloud DC.<br /><br />On a different note, if BGP is not ideal for service location and mobility in the service provider infrastructure, why would we want customers to use it for that purpose in tenant space?",

But now that you have BGP into the hypervisor, why stop at basic IP connectivity using BGP when you can get network virtualization as well with IP-VPN and E-VPN address families?<br /><br />The idea of running BGP to a vrouter/vswitch on the hypervisor has been what many in the decentralized control-plane camp have been pushing for quite some time and some vendors are actively building in one form or other.  Proposals to BGP peer with the ToR dynamically on DHCP offer and other ways have been floated in NVO3 mailing list from early on. ",

This address is advertized to the external world thro&#39; a virtual router running BGP. This ip address is unique to an application stack, so there is one-one mapping between application stack and this ip-address. By having such a model, it is easy to move the application stack from One DC to another DC ?. If /32 is used, it is just a BGP update. If DHCP is used, it is going to be DNS update ?. Is this a fair summarization of this post ?. <br /><br />BTW, why do i need an external VLAN as depicted in the picture but not explained in the post ?. Is it for overlay address space to be masked from underlay network (BGP session between Virtual router and BGP router ?)<br /><br />-Bhargav<br />",
