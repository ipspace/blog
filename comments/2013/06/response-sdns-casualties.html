            <div class="comment-content">New technologies will most likely contribute to job growth, not loss; as you&#39;ve pointed out, the key is to adapt.<br /><br />VMware did not cause a downsize in the server team for most companies - rather there is a shift in focus - instead of spending time rolling out big irons, they optimise, monitor and find new ways to use the scalable virtualised environment now, with the same or increase in the number of staff.<br /><br />SDN, in time to come, is going to achieve the same thing - instead of folks rolling out physical switches, they will spend most of their time monitoring, optimising and finding new ways to use the network.<br /><br />p.s. In the wireless LAN, I think architectures using Centralised Wireless controllers with protocols like CAPWAP look very much like SDN - and they have been around for some time. I guess that&#39;s missed opportunity for the marketing folks to name them Wireless SDN (wSDN).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Actually, VMware did downsize the server team. As the consolidation ratios rise, server teams are managing more instances with fewer personnel. A few years ago, the admin to instance ratio was 1:10. Now it is closer to 1:100 (or some are even higher). It also drove the skillset up the ladder allowing virtual administrators to pick up roles in storage and networking. <br /><br />Networking will be pruned to a certain degree - partially form improved technology and partially from the &quot;sharing&quot; of duties with other teams. <br /><br />Good point on the wireless controllers. They have a working SDN implementation to which datacenter networking is headed. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">@Anon<br /><br />There is actually a difference between an explicit downsize and a more favorable employee to device ratio. The total number of whatevers (VMs, networking devices, whatever) continues to climb in absolute terms. Despite several rounds of convergence, this macro trend remains true. <br /><br />Similarly, despite new technology trends, the absolute number of people to man these devices continues to rise. <br /><br />SDN should mean the two (devices and people) shouldn&#39;t have to grow at the same rate, but that is actually a different point than suggesting an industry-wide reduction in force. Such a workforce action is difficult to take for a lot of reasons, the least of which are technical. <br /><br />Rather than frame the discussion around who will lose their jobs (people will retire and self-select out over time anyway), I&#39;d rather focus on who will make a killing because they are evolved. I do think a DevOps person with networking engineering knowledge will cash in. They should have first mover advantage in a changing workforce.<br /><br />-Mike (@mbushong)<br />Plexxi</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Some more good news for network engineers.<br /><br />(1) Someone still needs to build the underlay network -- SDN doesn&#39;t mean there will no longer be boxes, ports and wires.  It just means there will be less people thinking you&#39;re an idiot for taking so long to deploy a machine.<br /><br />(2) A good deal of time is actually spent by network operators in trouble shooting application problems.  Most app folks don&#39;t [want to] know anything about what happens after their program calls an API for service.  There will always be a need for specialists that understand what happens between the program on one end and the program on the other.  <br /><br />(3) When your SDN ain&#39;t working, it might be a good insurance policy to have a specialist on hand.<br /><br />(4) SDN may actually mean fewer jobs for project managers involved in deployment management rather than fewer network specialists.  Most shops hardly had enough network specialists in the first place.<br /><br />(5) I personally don&#39;t know any network engineers that only provisioned vlans so I think most network engineer jobs are quite safe.  If all you do is program vlans, then you&#39;re probably really a server admin.  ;)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hard to find the product/application detail on the web, but HP has the &quot;Sentinel&quot; SDN application that turns the network into a distributed botnet filter and denies at the campus access layer if trying to go to rogue/malicious websites.  Switch redirects DNS requests (OF matching on port 53) to Tipping Point IPS, or there is some back end integration somehow, and validates DNS requests on ingress to network rather than at Internet Perimeter.  <br /><br />Distributed policy enforcement at the edge...in the campus.<br /><br />Sounds like a solid app, but not sure I&#39;d call it an &quot;SDN Campus Solution.&quot;<br /><br />-Jason</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Re Anon @10:00 .. HP currently has supported OpenFlow switches from its traditional ProCurve portfolio in 29 switches... At end of April 2013, it announced soon to be support for 40. These are the &quot;exH3C&#39;s switches with Comware OSv7&quot; .. <br /><br />These ProCurve switches are the ones that HP started providing commercial support on in March 2012, and we have been adding more products ever since. We have hundreds of customers running both full and hybrid OpenFlow deployments and lots of beta testers of our controller and SDN applications as well. <br /><br />Sentinel is not yet available for purchase.. If you want it, we can run beta trials with you. Speak to your local HPN team for details... <br /><br />Full disclosure &gt; HP employee </div>

            <div class="comment-content">There is some interesting research showing a decoupling between job growth and productivity:<br />http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/515926/how-technology-is-destroying-jobs/<br /><br />In the last decade, productivity continues to increase while job growth is not. <br /><br />This leads me to believe, that supplanting network engineer jobs (that spend the bulk of their time manually provisioning configurations that will be handled by SDN type solutions) with new SDN engineer jobs will not necessarily mean more jobs will be created. It&#39;s very probable that fewer network related jobs will be created, due to the efficiencies and increased productivity gains from future SDN solutions.</div>
