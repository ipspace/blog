    html: It&#39;s called &quot;creating mindshare&quot; ;) If we push enough people
      to learn it, maybe someone will start using it :D<br /><br />I had the same
      mixed feelings about IP Multicast in the CCIE R&amp;S exam.

    it in the real world? <br />:-)  <br /><br />Kieran<br />

    html: Yes, but i cannot tell who exactly due to security reasons. One of the mobile
      network operators in Russia uses this technology in that way.

    html: I think this ISP with CsC runs it as a result of acqusition. For some reason
      I believe I know the network in question.<br /><br />That means if given ISP
      would have an option to plan the network from the very start (taking acqusitions
      into account), they would be more likely going for another architecture.

  html: If one big service provider have MPLS/IP ( AS 100, for example) high-level
    network based on DWDM links and several MPLS/IP Metropolitan Area Networks in
    different cities, regions ( AS 200 ), than CsC will be a great tool to connect
    them via MPLS L3VPN.

    the super carrier and the divisions of the state (police, universities, etc) are
    the customers. Many of these sub-orgs are large enough to run their own MPLS networks. '

    html: I&#39;ve seen plenty of RFPs in my life and the resulting networks, and
      the list of features asked for and actually used were widely different ;) ...
      and from the vendor perspective you have to support whatever your customers
      decide to throw into a kitchen-sink RFP requirement list.

  html: I have a different perspective, the opposite one - The fact that all major
    vendors support this feature means it has traction. the days where you released
    a feature in order to get traction are (nearly) over. today, the major carriers
    dictate most of the features and vendors follow to get deals. you can ask any
    PLM at any vendor how many features are postpone or cancelled because of business
    drivers.

  html: I do not know about any real implementation.<br />But I believe such implementation
    must exist in large countries like US and Russia, where even large MPLS service
    providers cannot cover whole country with private optics, and are forced to lease
    lambdas or use other SPs VPN services.<br />Certainly, layer2 VPNs will be much
    simpler solution for this situation, but again, for large SPs it can be an awful
    lot of point-to-point L2 VPNs, while VPLS will have a lot of drawbacks, so L3
    MPLS VPN+labeled BGP with Carrier SP would perform best.

    MPLS RPF check.

  html: It&#39;s not that &quot;most of the transit providers prefer offering VPLS
    (or other EoX) services&quot; but rather that it is way easier to sell Ethernet
    services (which are really *implemented* as VPLS or EoX, but that is transparent
    to the customer).<br /><br />From a network operations view, L3VPNs in general
    are much easier for the SP NOC to troubleshoot with the customer since the CE
    and PE do exchange some NLRI which can be viewed by both the SP and the Customer
    NOCs.  Most customers do not really have the ability to troubleshoot Ethernet
    services due to both lack of knowledge and tools (and the belief that Ethernet
    just magically works). This situation could be improved if both customers and
    service providers used CFM as a diagnostic tool, but I have yet to see this in
    the real world either.

  html: In our multi network merger environment, existing MPLS networks have been
    migrated from having their own dedicated backhaul to a Carrier&#39;s Carrier model.  Easier
    than migrating all the customers.

  html: FWIW, a couple years on, CsC is still not a commonly available service from
    our favorite public ISPs.<br /><br />Having said that, I will add that it is being
    deployed in atleast one less-than-public network - with mostly successful results
    thus far.

  html: I am personally responsible for designing the customer side of a CSC network
    to interconnect 10 POPs for our network. Used correctly, it can be a very strong
    design.<br /><br />1. The POPs will have some hefty multicast flow requirements
    between one another, making VPLS a poor option for the core carrier.<br /><br
    />2. CSC is very easy from a conceptual perspective. Its actually easier for us
    to implement CSC than if the carrier provided us a L2VPN. If they did that, I
    would either have to create a new IGP process for inter-POP communications, or
    use area 0 in across the world with non-area-0 in each POP (something like that).
    Then, I would have to either use seamless MPLS or leak PE loopbacks across IGP
    boundaries ... note that seamless MPLS and CSC are almost identical designs, except
    the former is for an intra-AS design :)<br /><br />3. Maximum isolation of failure
    domains. I can add a new POP later, run eBGP+Label with the core carrier, and
    there is no significant change to the other N-1 POPs notwithstanding the BGP routes
    they&#39;ll learn from the newly-added POP. With VPLS, assuming I extended IGP
    across the globe, that changes a bit. Customer also has a stiff requirement for
    isolation since failures in a POP should minimally affect other POPs.<br /><br
    />4. Label filtering is a breeze. I only want to allocate BGP labels for my PE
    loopbacks, while aggregating the networks of my POP transit links into something
    coarse (like a /16) so I can still have full IP reachability to assist my operations
    staff with troubleshooting. I suppose this is also true for LDP, but I only need
    to manage it at a single exchange point, rather than a big broadcast segment with
    many peers.<br /><br />Moral of the story is that just because a service is not
    commonly offered does not mean it lacks value. Likewise, just because something
    is popular/hyped-up does not mean it has value. Thanks Ivan for the great conversation
    :)<br /><br />-Nick
