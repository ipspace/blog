  html: I think that there will be a high performance hit when a physical network
    is converted to a virtualized. Because it means &#39;virtual&#39; L2 frames to
    go packed over real L3 frames, which go over real L2 frames. Well, try to send
    something larger over something smaller. What happens ? Yes - fragmentation. Also
    you&#39;ll have to send 2xL2 frame headers + 2xL3 Frame headers (total 4) for
    one &#39;virtual&#39; L2 frame. What finally will this cause - you to spend a
    lot more to buy faster cards, high end equipment....
