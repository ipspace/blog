Because there might not be enough hardware deployed that supports it or people with experience deploying it.<br /><br />I think Network Virtualization is more similar to Server Virtualization than people realize, with Server Virtualization people didn&#39;t buy new hardware at first. And Network Virtualization overlays also means we don&#39;t need to buy new hardware.<br /><br />Overlays might not be the definitive form, but that is where people will start. It&#39;s just makes economic sense.",
