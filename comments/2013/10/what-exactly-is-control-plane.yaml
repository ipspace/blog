  html: Excellent question, I think the outdated RFC 792 explains it very well. Why
    else would they call it control message protocol?

  html: My view is that data plane / control plan / management plane are high level
    abstractions.  I&#39;m not sure how useful it is to be able to strictly classify
    every protocol or packet type.  And I think the problem would get worse when you
    try to make distinctions between control and management protocols.<br /><br />But
    FWIW, wouldn&#39;t Openflow have many of the same issues with classification,
    since a lot of Openflow traffic is going to be generated in response to unknown
    packets?

  html: Seems like a grey area. ICMP is confusing in another way too -- it&#39;s considered
    part of layer 3, but it&#39;s like a layer 4 protocol in that is has its own IP
    protocol number and the ICMP header comes after the IP header.<br /><br />- Nik

    html: Are ECN TCP bits then also a control-plane protocol? What&#39;s the difference
      between setting bits to indicate congestion and sending a packet to indicate
      network error?

  html: ICMP is a control-plane protocol.  The confusion (such as it is) is that control-plane
    protocols are in-band in TCP/IP - consider BGP multi-hop, for example.

  html: Would probably define Control plane as following<br /><br />Control plane
    is a process by which certain states are derviated to aid data plane. Most of
    the protocols (BGP, OSPF...) derive states independent of data plane. Certain
    protocols like Multicast, ICMP use data plane itself to arrive at states to aid
    data plane. <br /><br />Strictly speaking, Control plane policing (CoPP) could
    probably be renamed to CPU Policing, as policies both control and data plane.

  html: This discussion is multi-level. <br /><br />1. From the definition point of
    view ICMP is the control plane protocol. <br />2. From the hardware point of view
    some protocols (like ICMP, BFD) can be offloaded to line cards so they do not
    affect the HW control plane which is represented by a control module. It is hard
    to say about PING represented by an ICMP Echo Request that this is a control-plane
    packet on distributed devices. An LC can respond. Thus no operations really needed
    on the RP CPU.<br />3. Does it mean that the control plane can be just attributed
    to the HW module? Of course not. The control plane is more like an abstraction
    - as someone mentioned earlier. So from the functionality/abstraction point of
    view some protocols can be the control/data/mgmt (match any) plane protocols at
    the same time.

  html: Ivan, although we&#39;ve discussed it in the original post, i don&#39;t see
    any obvious reason why a response to a data plane packet cannot be a control plane
    packet.<br /><br />So, i can see a clear role for ICMP as a two-way control plane
    protocol handling the status/info communication between devices and as an one-way
    control plane protocol handling the error reporting of a device towards another.

  html: 'Hey Ivan, I have one more question: Which plane generates a &quot;TTL expired&quot;
    message? <br />I think that the answer should be: depends on implementation. It
    could be a process running on router CPU (control plane process) or hardware ASIC
    (data plane).<br />Same is for ICMP replies. Some hardware may implement it in
    ASIC, but usually this is a kernel process (control plane).'
