      "html": "Great overview of what overlay networking is all about.  I expect to see a lot of FUD come out of the Cisco camp once the Insieme products start to be announced and roll out. <br /><br />I will say I am more of a fan of Juniper&#39;s Contrail and ALU&#39;s Nuage offerings than NSX for a pure OpenStack deployment, but obviously those don&#39;t exist for VMWare as of yet.  Contrail especially since it just uses standard L3VPNs and MPLSoGRE, I already have it working with a pair of MX960s and ASR9Ks, even a SRX650 firewall in the same overlay network.   The use of XMPP to distribute member router, etc. to vrouters is highly scalable as well.  ",

      "html": "I would argue that the &quot;defining the problem&quot; is not a technical discussion. Rather, the need for software defined network overlays (NSX) is driven by the overhead of current network implementation and orchestration. Compute and virtualization teams are now demanding a network that keeps pace with compute virtualization. <br /><br />As physical compute and storage have been commoditized, datacenter networking will be soon.",
