      "html": "I think  fuzz tools are used for developers to test invalid/random data against  programs more that inject sql. You can use tools like this one which makes sql injection attacks (while fuzzing try to see how your app behaviour when get random data this sort of tools makes developed sql injection attacks): http://marathontool.codeplex.com/<br /><br />There are some owasp advices to prevent this kind of attacks: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet<br /><br />Basically talks about use prepared queries (avoiding dinamic queries), use store procedures to detect anormal updates, beware of escaped characters,.. You can see other tools as Green Sql which is a database firewall with sql injection prevent features: http://www.greensql.com/ or use web application firewall with signatures of sql injections plus some other types attack signatures and use integrity monitor on databases, a approach in the same way as file integrity checkers but with database data.<br /><br />Kind regards",
