  html: Great blog, Ivan! <br /><br />I&#39;ve been increasingly feeling the need
    for some basic scaling fact-checking with SDN. Without recognizing the limitations
    of real hardware, the sky&#39;s the limit (and it&#39;s all magic). As a big science
    fiction reader, the best books come from boundaries / constraints, i.e. the technology
    or magic cannot just do anything, the protagonist has to work within limits. The
    same applies to SDN. I find that I&#39;m very interested in knowing where the
    challenges lie, when I&#39;m reading an enthusiastic SDN / OpenFlow blog. After
    all, if it were easy, we&#39;d be doing it already. But it&#39;s also feasibility
    in the real world that tells us in which direction the technology is likely to
    evolve. Yes, software boxes can hold very large routing or MAC tables -- but what
    does that imply for forwarding? Hence Brocade talking about their virtual router
    maybe being used as route reflector (but not in a huge forwarding path). Although
    their forwarding isn&#39;t shabby from another point of view, it&#39;s not what
    a large hardware can do.<br /><br />Good stuff!

  html: Excellent post. You also had an older post on building your own SDN lab and
    testing and turning the knobs on some of the open products out there and you listed
    some switches etc again. I was looking for that post but could not find it. If
    you don&#39;t mind could you point to the link? It was one of the best posts that
    guided someone on where to go to get started on &quot;fiddling&quot; with SDN.
    Or maybe an update of it to cover OF 1.3<br /><br />Regards..

    html: You&#39;re absolutely right. Thanks for pointing this out (and opening yet
      another can of worms ;).

  html: Watch out for 1.3 switches that only have a single table. Ultimately you want
    1.4 plus TTPs.

  html: "Hi Ivan. Reading your very interesting article and getting knowledge about\
    \ openflow (I have read that is a standard networking protocol for virtualization)\
    \ I have a question why openflow 1.3 is better than 1.0. When you write this:<br\
    \ />Table #1 \u2013 ACL and tenant classification table. This table would match\
    \ input ports (for tenant classification) and ACL entries, drop the packets not\
    \ matched by input ACLs, and redirect the forwarding logic to correct per-tenant\
    \ table.<br />Table #2 .. #n \u2013 per-tenant forwarding tables, matching destination\
    \ MAC addresses and specifying output ports<br /><br />Difference from openflow\
    \ 1.0 is that openflow 1.3 does not perform cartesian product between mac addresses-ports-acls\
    \ because first lookup flows table is smaller and discard traffic not in that\
    \ tuples, so I guess has better performance?<br /><br />Kind regards,"

  html: Ivan, very good article. But I have to say, not only NEC, but Centec also
    has openflow 1.3 enabled SDN switch, which can support 32K 5-tuple L2 flow and
    32K 7-tuple L3/L4 flow without TCAM support (use hash, but any field can be masked
    globally). ACL(tcam or hash)+ mac/LPM two stages flow table can be supported.

  html: 'Also note that the IBM G8264 supports putting rules in the MAC hash table
    despite only supporting OF1.0 (for now) by intelligently realizing when a rule
    matches on DMAC and VLAN only. '

  html: "Well I\xB4m new to openflow and I discovered that my 3Com switches I purchased\
    \ in year 2009 received openflow 1.3.1 support, well at least HP tells me within\
    \ their release notes http://h20564.www2.hp.com/portal/site/hpsc/public/kb/docDisplay/?docId=c04078970<br\
    \ /><br />Looking at that software feature changes file, I can read something\
    \ like a limit of  &quot;3000 flows&quot;; also there\xB4s a table telling me\
    \ what is &quot;Not supported&quot;. Therefore I\xB4m asking myself whether this\
    \ is only marketing or whether I can actually do something useful with openflow\
    \ on this switch? <br /><br />Also, I\xB4d like to suggest a blog entry which\
    \ summarize what to look for when starting with openflow (comparing with old routing\
    \ world, e.g. ospf without sometjing like BFD in core setups is useless...)<br\
    \ /><br />Regards, Michael"
