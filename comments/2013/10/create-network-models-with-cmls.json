      "html": "I saw this live at Cisco Live Orlando 2013. From what they told me, they are going to have three different models. 1) an Ubuntu VM that users could run a their laptop (free). 2) A hosted model where users can pay for &quot;virtual rack time&quot; (think Junosphere). 3) An appliance that is production grade for companies that want to model their network and test changes before applying it in production (not free course).<br /><br />Not sure if this is still what Cisco&#39;s plan is. The version I saw was running on Vmware Fusion on a Mac laptop. The front end application was pointed at a back end server where all of the VMs were running. Just like in GNS3 where you can specify a remote hypervisor (running on Amazon, etc). <br /><br />Another notable feature is that you are not just limited to running the Cisco IOS VMs. Since it leverages KVM, you can also virtualize host operating systems, or any other &quot;virtualizable&quot; thing. This means that one can integrate all of these other VMs on the topology (just like one can use a host operating system vm with GNS3). <br /><br />It also provides means of connecting the topology to the physical network. For example, a company using the appliance could feed the BGP table to the virtual network via a BGP session between a virtual XR instance and a physical BGP router on the network. <br /><br />...The possibilities are endless =) ",
