Add a third VM in one of the subnets, ping between all three and dump ARP tables on all three VMs.<br /><br />Thank you!<br />Ivan",

The arp table shows the entries for the other VM in the same subnet and that of the implied router. <br />Also, while you can ping your gateway (10.0.0.33-&gt;10.0.0.1), you cannot ping the gateway on the other subnet (10.0.0.33-&gt;10.0.1.1). <br />",
