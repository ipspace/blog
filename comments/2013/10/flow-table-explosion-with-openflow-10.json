      "html": "Great blog, Ivan! <br /><br />I&#39;ve been increasingly feeling the need for some basic scaling fact-checking with SDN. Without recognizing the limitations of real hardware, the sky&#39;s the limit (and it&#39;s all magic). As a big science fiction reader, the best books come from boundaries / constraints, i.e. the technology or magic cannot just do anything, the protagonist has to work within limits. The same applies to SDN. I find that I&#39;m very interested in knowing where the challenges lie, when I&#39;m reading an enthusiastic SDN / OpenFlow blog. After all, if it were easy, we&#39;d be doing it already. But it&#39;s also feasibility in the real world that tells us in which direction the technology is likely to evolve. Yes, software boxes can hold very large routing or MAC tables -- but what does that imply for forwarding? Hence Brocade talking about their virtual router maybe being used as route reflector (but not in a huge forwarding path). Although their forwarding isn&#39;t shabby from another point of view, it&#39;s not what a large hardware can do.<br /><br />Good stuff!",

      "html": "Excellent post. You also had an older post on building your own SDN lab and testing and turning the knobs on some of the open products out there and you listed some switches etc again. I was looking for that post but could not find it. If you don&#39;t mind could you point to the link? It was one of the best posts that guided someone on where to go to get started on &quot;fiddling&quot; with SDN. Or maybe an update of it to cover OF 1.3<br /><br />Regards..",

      "html": "Hi Ivan. Reading your very interesting article and getting knowledge about openflow (I have read that is a standard networking protocol for virtualization) I have a question why openflow 1.3 is better than 1.0. When you write this:<br />Table #1 \u2013 ACL and tenant classification table. This table would match input ports (for tenant classification) and ACL entries, drop the packets not matched by input ACLs, and redirect the forwarding logic to correct per-tenant table.<br />Table #2 .. #n \u2013 per-tenant forwarding tables, matching destination MAC addresses and specifying output ports<br /><br />Difference from openflow 1.0 is that openflow 1.3 does not perform cartesian product between mac addresses-ports-acls because first lookup flows table is smaller and discard traffic not in that tuples, so I guess has better performance?<br /><br />Kind regards,",

Therefore I\u00b4m asking myself whether this is only marketing or whether I can actually do something useful with openflow on this switch? <br /><br />Also, I\u00b4d like to suggest a blog entry which summarize what to look for when starting with openflow (comparing with old routing world, e.g. ospf without sometjing like BFD in core setups is useless...)<br /><br />Regards, Michael",
