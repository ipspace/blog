      "html": "Idea with best external , add-path with n or all , shadow RRs or session all adds extra state and require extra memory. If logical bgp topology cannot follow phsycail ( it should ) , then I believe best two approach is , first R1 could take the C1&#39;s IGP cost to external peering router into consideration and calculate best path from C1&#39;s point of view or there is one another draft which is angular distance aproach which puts the al the nodes basically in a circle and calculate the angular distance from RR to other nodes. First approach is like secondary SPF calculation of remofe LFA or  Not-Via tunnels so it adds maybe extra initial processing load but end result is less memory need, agree Ivan ? <br /><br />Thanks",
