If logical bgp topology cannot follow phsycail ( it should ) , then I believe best two approach is , first R1 could take the C1&#39;s IGP cost to external peering router into consideration and calculate best path from C1&#39;s point of view or there is one another draft which is angular distance aproach which puts the al the nodes basically in a circle and calculate the angular distance from RR to other nodes. First approach is like secondary SPF calculation of remofe LFA or  Not-Via tunnels so it adds maybe extra initial processing load but end result is less memory need, agree Ivan ? <br /><br />Thanks",

And the reason for IBGP full-mesh is to ensure all IBGP speakers &ldquo;see&rdquo; the same. Back to this topology, E1,E2 are the common clients for R1 and R2, however, C1 and C2 belong to only one RR. If we remove the RR from the picture, we would see a topology that IBGP full mesh is not there. So to resolve this problem, just have C1 join the Cluster with R1 and C2 join the cluster with R2.</p>\n",
