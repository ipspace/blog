A real IGP (ospf...) will be more suitable. As far as (i/e)BGP is configured with a higher preference in all routers, SDN injected routes will always take precedence. <br />Advantages are:<br />   - Faster IGP<br />   - No need to use BGP communities to limit the scope of the injected BGP routes (No BGP peering is needed between the routers)<br />   - More &quot;standard&quot; deployment as using a real IGP as an IGP :) :)<br />   - Easy to introduce to a network already in production...<br />",

You can just let OSPF or IS-IS do its job.  If you want to deploy policy then you will need some mechanism to populate the forwarding tables on the routers (or router software running on a server, if that is your model) to implement the policy.  In this case BGP is used as the protocol by software running on both the controller and routers.<br /><br />One of the challenges for SDN, in my opinion, is that network resources are much more complex than compute or storage resources in that raw bandwidth is not the only (or even in many cases the most important) quantity to optimize.  As others have said, it is all about the use case.  ",

In compute and storage, software definitions are utilized to standardize the hardware and remove its administration. Rack and stack, baseline, and then orchestrate in software. SDN is trying to do the same with datacenter networks. Provide a physical bus and allow software to utilize the bus as needed.<br /><br />So, when I deploy a new service, I want to select &#39;so much&#39; compute, &#39;so much&#39; storage, and &#39;so much&#39; networking. Submit this request and have the operating systems and applications come online, the network segments with routers, firewall policy, and logging become available; and destroy it all when finished. <br /><br />Compute and storage have already enabled the consumer to hold the keys to service delivery, networking needs to catch up. <br /><br />I also need to ask, in your diagrams above, why would you ever want traffic to traverse B and C unless there is a failure?",

However, one of our intended goals was to keep the routing model destination based, to maintain design simplicity. Flow-based forwarding is just too low-level and hence gives too much freedom of implementation and hence complexities :)",

But reading about it a bit tells me that you can do the same thing with BGP FLowSpec because BGP FlowSpec goes through a validation process (to avoid spoofing) that essentially means that only the originator of the route can change the Flow...unless I am reading it wrong.",

      "html": "Stumbled upon this article today a little late.  <br /><br />Years ago I played around with a simple datacenter topology where each rack was a different confederation Sub-AS.  I know confederations are totally out of style these days but seems like it would work as well in this instance.  <br /><br />What you describe with regards to next-hop control, etc. is exactly how Internap&#39;s MIRO routing control works at their edge, and has since probably the late 90s.   Slightly different scenario since they are using it to control outbound traffic paths on upstream transit providers.   Their MIRO controller is internally written and has lots of knobs in order to optimize the routing and place constraints on paths, would be cool if they open sourced it.  <br /><br />Juniper QFabric architecture is also based on BGP... <br /><br />While I&#39;m agnostic to it, I know like we&#39;ve seen in the comments most feel source routing has to be a part of any SDN solution.  In reality on my network today I source route high priority traffic by using different RSVP LSPs on the network.  <br /><br />I think in a DC context using Segment Routing along with a scalable distribution protocol like BGP may work extremely well.   In the future a protocol like I2RS may be a better fit than BGP as a control protocol.  <br /><br />",

      "html": "Thanks for the write up Ivan. If controller sends the next-hop C to B to use for D , We assume controller is taking source or somehow service information while it is computing the path ? Otherwise if B would use C as next hop always to reach to D , then we would lose the ability of multipath for B. <br />Thanks ",
