  html: FCS in winter 2014? Is it that far away? Was expecting some kind of release
    a couple of months from now.

  html: Yeah. I really hope Cisco does not mess this up. Watching Hitchhikers guide
    to OnePK and would be really useful to have VIRL and development in one environment.
    That would really help for us engineers that need to learn some programming as
    well.

    html: Yes. They said you&#39;ll be able to add your VMs to the environment (servers
      ...) as well as interact with the outside world through the usual &quot;physical&quot;
      Ethernet interfaces.<br /><br />Keep in mind that CML is nothing else than a
      single-host OpenStack deployment - anything you could do in OpenStack you could
      (theoretically) do with CML.

  html: Will you be able to attach the virtual network on your laptop/PC via VIRL
    to a real network ?<br /><br />Say you have a lab with 10 real routers. Running
    IS-IS. Now you attach your PC, which has a 100 virtual (virl) routers. Suddenly
    your IS-IS network has 110 routers, consisting of a combination of real and virtual
    routers. This could be a nice way to check interoperability.

    html: Actually you could contact the Cisco accounting team, they do disclose the
      preliminary pricing information. And yes, everyone would get some. It&#39;s
      not too cheap though.

  html: I&#39;m sure they are tight lipped on pricing / licensing specifics...but
    any hints as to who they expect a typical customer for this might be?  Large enterprises/SP&#39;s,
    individuals running labs at home, etc?

  html: We&#39;ve been running 70+ router emulation environments via Dynamips for
    some years to verify routing policy changes etc. hooked up to physical test kit
    when necessary. The ability to have a Cisco provided solution running on Cisco
    Hardware (C Series Servers) that is fully supported is really exciting. I&#39;ll
    certainly be hassling my Account Manager for more info.

    html: sure but seriously, if your a skilled engineer but say not expert on MPLS
      TE on the IOS-XR routers. Now it seems like with a few days on VIRL you can
      be therefore it can probably be a good way to reduce consultancy costs if you
      already have a team of strong engineers who need to learn a new technology.

    html: If you are fluent in the nuances of MPLS TE (technology details and design
      challenges) then VIRL will definitely give you hands-on experience you need
      prior to deployment - so you&#39;ll be able to do the deployment yourself instead
      of using consultants.<br /><br />If you think VIRL will give you design expertise,
      then my original comment still applies ;) See also RFC 1925 section 2.4

  html: 'Still on the fence about this solution of short-cutting the forwarding plane
    versus what Juniper is doing with things like Virtual MX.   With the VMX Juniper
    is actually emulating the PFE, so the throughput is terrible, only around 1kpps,
    and it takes a lot of CPU resources, but it truly tests both control and forwarding
    plane, including things like hashing.   '

  html: Each virtual routers are basically VMs orchestrated via OpenStack via Java
    based GUI called VMMaestro ,copyrighted Cisco (not Oracles as many bloggers suggested).
    Wish bloggers would stop blogging based on others blog. :-)<br />Networking is
    through virtual switches, tap / tunnels,so no reason you cannot connect them to
    a physical box .  <br />

  html: At Cisco Live in Milano last week they had a demo of CML running that you
    could try out in the walk in labs and also on display at the learingnetwork booth.
    They&#39;re releasing two versions of it one for private use that would cost aprox
    $100 and with a 15 device limit and then a corporate version with no limits but
    the guy i talked to didn&#39;t know the price for that one yet.

    the data centre features, like OTV, vPC, LACP? I am not a user, but thinking of
    moving from GNS3 to VIRL. And then this came up...
