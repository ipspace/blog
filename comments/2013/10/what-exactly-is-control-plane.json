I&#39;m not sure how useful it is to be able to strictly classify every protocol or packet type.  And I think the problem would get worse when you try to make distinctions between control and management protocols.<br /><br />But FWIW, wouldn&#39;t Openflow have many of the same issues with classification, since a lot of Openflow traffic is going to be generated in response to unknown packets?",

Most of the protocols (BGP, OSPF...) derive states independent of data plane. Certain protocols like Multicast, ICMP use data plane itself to arrive at states to aid data plane. <br /><br />Strictly speaking, Control plane policing (CoPP) could probably be renamed to CPU Policing, as policies both control and data plane.",

      "html": "This discussion is multi-level. <br /><br />1. From the definition point of view ICMP is the control plane protocol. <br />2. From the hardware point of view some protocols (like ICMP, BFD) can be offloaded to line cards so they do not affect the HW control plane which is represented by a control module. It is hard to say about PING represented by an ICMP Echo Request that this is a control-plane packet on distributed devices. An LC can respond. Thus no operations really needed on the RP CPU.<br />3. Does it mean that the control plane can be just attributed to the HW module? Of course not. The control plane is more like an abstraction - as someone mentioned earlier. So from the functionality/abstraction point of view some protocols can be the control/data/mgmt (match any) plane protocols at the same time.",

It could be a process running on router CPU (control plane process) or hardware ASIC (data plane).<br />Same is for ICMP replies. Some hardware may implement it in ASIC, but usually this is a kernel process (control plane).",
