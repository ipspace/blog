It is not possible to enable spanning tree on Citrix NetScaler.<br />It is best practice to enable &quot;Bridge BPDU&quot; mode NetScaler when operating the NetScaler in Layer 2 mode in order to avoid accidental forwarding loops.<br />Also, with Layer 2 mode enabled on NetScaler, it is entirely possible to configure topologies that will result in forwarding loops that STP cannot resolve.<br /><br /><br />",
