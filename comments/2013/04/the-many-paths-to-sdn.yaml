  html: Good read Ivan, I have been wondering whether OF-Config get lumped into OF-Switch
    at some point. Fact that no one really talks about it makes me think vendors have
    a reason for ignoring it. OVSDB is a slick management plane proto worthy of the
    list. <br /><br />Really liked that IXP slide deck. I think thats a solid use
    case. Listened to Feamster talk about one in ATL that they are looking for participants
    in an IETF86 recording. <br /><br />I had never even heard of that CloudFlare
    setup, that pretty neat/brave, bravo. Just checked YouTube and still no sign of
    your presentation video, bah.<br /><br />Cheers!<br />-Brent<br /><br />

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Your blog was pointed to me by a friend.<br />First -
    thanks for at least mentioning ForCES.<br />If you were to talk to the ONF folks
    - we dont exist.<br /><br />You did miss some things about ForCES.<br />ForCES
    is/can be used for south/north and config AND<br />despite the myth of it being
    an artifact of history,<br />it is deployed.<br />Here&#39;s a little intro:<br

    />cheers,<br />jamal (ForCES co-chair)

    html: Hi Lincoln!<br /><br />I&#39;m well aware of eAPI and I love its simplicity
      (I was talking about it on the update webinar two days ago), but I explicitly
      decided not to mention vendor-specific mechanisms (no need to tell me how no
      two NETCONFs are alike :D )<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback!<br />Ivan

  html: "hi Ivan,<br />You could now add eAPI from Arista which is a JSON-RPC representation\
    \ of the CLI as another method that doesn&#39;t require you to have a PhD in understanding\
    \ the schema used by something.<br /><br />e.g. from python these 5 lines would\
    \ tell you the interface status of every interface:<br />..from jsonrpclib import\
    \ Server<br />..switch = Server( &quot;https://username:passw0rd@myswitch/eapi/v1&quot;\
    \ )<br />..interfaces = switch.runCli( cmds=[ \u201Cshow interfaces\u201D ] )<br\
    \ />..for name, interface in interfaces.items():<br />....print \u201CInterface\u201D\
    , name, \u201Cis\u201D, interface[ \u201ClineProtocol\u201D ]<br />"

  html: Besides routers, SDN can and is also applied to (virtual) switches. Your picture
    could be enhanced to show L2 related state. Moreover, some SDN solutions provide
    virtual overlays, creating many independent instances of control and data plane
    state
