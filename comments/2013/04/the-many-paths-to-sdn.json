      "html": "Good read Ivan, I have been wondering whether OF-Config get lumped into OF-Switch at some point. Fact that no one really talks about it makes me think vendors have a reason for ignoring it. OVSDB is a slick management plane proto worthy of the list. <br /><br />Really liked that IXP slide deck. I think thats a solid use case. Listened to Feamster talk about one in ATL that they are looking for participants in an IETF86 recording. <br /><br />I had never even heard of that CloudFlare setup, that pretty neat/brave, bravo. Just checked YouTube and still no sign of your presentation video, bah.<br /><br />Cheers!<br />-Brent<br /><br />",
