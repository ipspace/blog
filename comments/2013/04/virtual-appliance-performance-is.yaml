    html: Thanks for the link. I am not exactly impressed by 500 Mbps and really wondering
      what Cisco managed to do to burn one vCPU @ 50 Mbps. Are they process switching
      all the traffic through IOS Linux process?

    html: That is the REALLY weird part<br /><br />For Vyatta (open source version
      used in test) they did that 500Mbps on just ONE core<br /><br />for the Cisco
      test it took FOUR cores to do just 50Mbps<br /><br />something is really odd
      there...<br /><br />

    html: As you go higher up in the stack, the algorithms become more complex (compare
      HTTP-level IDS with packet filter), and thus it makes less and less sense to
      implement them in hardware. <br /><br />Most advanced load balancers are implemented
      primarily in software. For IDS data points, read the erratasec blog posts I
      linked to.

    html: 'Almost every single IPS box can be easily bypassed w/ variations of exploit
      payload because of the signature matching in hardware w/ minimal protocol parsing
      &amp; decoding around the context of the vulnerability. The systems that did
      most protocol decoding and little hardware offload for signature matching did
      the best job. Compare ISS Proventia vs Intravert - ISS was mostly software,
      had best decoding and was much harder to bypass with exploits with custom payload
      since they decoded up to the vulnerability in many cases, while signature-based
      hardware accelerated solutions get walked around by hackers all day long w/
      polymorphic  attacks.  <br /><br />Do you want a system that can easily be updated
      w/ software and scale out / up as processors get faster, or do you want limited
      set of features that work really fast in hardware? There pros and cons for both,
      let&#39;s review in a decade from now and see where L4-L7 services get realized.
      Many arguments can be made one way or the other, but I surely would not bet
      against software &amp; Intel combo myself... '

    html: Hi, Ivan. <br />Thanks for the interesting post, as usual ;-)<br />So, in
      the near future do you think that all today&#39;s standalone physical appliances
      will become virtual and distributed, having just the portion of state and rules
      relevant to the local bunch of VMs - say one for hypervisor? With rules and
      state migration following the VM?<br /><br />Thanks, <br />Ariel.

    html: Virtual? Yes. Distributed? It depends. You can do distributed firewalling,
      but not load balancing. Yeah, already in the to-write queue ;)

      Also works in a virtual appliance.

    html: 'Open up the top vendors&#39; largest appliances that handle L4-L7 services
      and you will find that unless you are doing crypto offload (Cavium, Safenet),
      signature matching in hardware (questionable value given the bypass vectors)
      or micrflow balancing / spreading load across conventional x86 processors, most
      features are implemented in software on x86. You could also go down the Cavium
      Octeon or network processor path, but why - given the DPDK/x86 performance capabilities.
      <br /><br />Also, do you really want to keep forklifting your Firewall/LB networking
      gear for the next rev of contract manufactured hardware or does it make sense
      to align with &quot;Moore&#39;s Law Networking&quot; on commodity servers? Servers
      upgrade cycle is 2-3 years, contract manufactured L4-L7 appliances have typically
      a lifecycle of 5-7 years. Open your 5 year old top end firewall and there is
      a good chance your desktop processor is faster... '

    html: Hold on. What I said was &quot;L4-7 in software makes sense, high-speed
      L2-3 in software is too expensive&quot;. Also, keep in mind that a 2600 probably
      has a $0.02 CPU - 40-50 Gbps packet forwarding through a Xeon-based server (with
      minimal packet processing) is very doable.

  html: 'Every time someone says implement your network equipment virtually I think:
    So what about ternary RAM?<br /><br />I&#39;ve seen so many blogs and read so
    many books that harp on not sending packets to the CPU in a hardware switch/router
    as it will impact performance and that ternary RAM is needed for large IP tables
    / various ACLs / etc.<br /><br />What I really feel when discussing virtual switch/appliances
    is basic features that the 2600s of ye olde would handle.  If you&#39;re confortable
    running your network on a 2600 - virtualize.  If not........'

  html: I think I can agree and disagree on many things. If you are positioning a
    distributed cloud based enterprise, the vAppliance is &quot;good enough&quot;
    in most cases. However, cloud providers have caught on to these appliances and
    are starting to charge for CPU more than disk in some cases.<br /><br />That said,
    there are many hardware appliances that far outstrip their virtual brethren simply
    because of hardware acceleration. In the case of load balancing, SSL stripping
    and re-encryption CANNOT be done at line-rate without specialized hardware. The
    same goes for HTTPS inspection of UTM, IPS, and firewall traffic. Packet-forwarding
    is a quaint topic. Claiming high through-put for routing pretty much means nothing
    as those functions are increasingly commodity and being stuffed in devices that
    are capable of much more. If you think stateful firewalls still make your network
    safe, you need to lift the rock you have been living under.<br /><br />Sorry to
    be so harsh, but some of these articles are very myopic and don&#39;t really address
    the issues of a modern network. That is why the state funded phrackers (my word,
    it is a play on water-fracking for natural gas, because this is analogous to how
    modern &#39;hackers&#39; mine data from networks) pwn you.<br />
