          "html": "Hi!<br /><br />v2 of this post - I&#39;m anxiously waiting to see what Cisco did for non-multicast VXLAN ;)<br /><br />Larger-scale vMotion - while vMotion outside of a DRS cluster is not automatic (you have to trigger it manually), people use it for coarse-grained resource allocation (if a cluster becomes overloaded, it&#39;s pretty easy to move a whole app stack somewhere else) or prior to large-scale maintenance activities ... and then there&#39;s the long-distance unicorn-riding variant ;)<br /><br />As for &quot;what most customers need&quot; - 80+% of them are probably fine with a single cluster or two. That&#39;s 60 servers; if you buy high-end gear, you could pack few thousand VMs onto them. More than enough in many cases, unless you&#39;re going down the full-VDI route.<br /><br />Multiple NX1KV instances per DC is obviously a good idea, but keep in mind that<br /><br />A) you cannot vMotion a running VM across them;<br />B) Configuration changes made in one vDS are not propagated to another one, so you need an automation layer on top (could be of the cut-and-paste variant :D ).<br /><br />Ivan",

      "html": "I look forward to v2 of this post in a few months when multicast isn&#39;t being used and packet replication is being performed somewhere else - vswitch or node in control cluster, etc.<br /><br />Many customers limit vMotion to 32 physical hosts since that is the largest size of a cluster.  It has been validated you can vMotion between clusters under a given set of conditions, but do [large] customers do this?   I wonder myself about the holy grail.  What&#39;s your take?  What are you seeing?<br /><br />As Cisco continues to increase scale for the 1000V to catch up to VMware, is it needed for *most* customers?  Rather if vMotion is contained to cluster size, would it not be advantageous to maintain 2, 3, or even 4 VSMs on the 1000V to reduce single points of failure for the virtual network?  Once could argue either way, but what is your take?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Jason (@jedelman8)<br /><br />",

For a customer of that size, I&#39;d imagine they can write some scripts using the vSphere SDK/APIs.<br /><br />With talking to Cisco a few weeks back, they were recommending to use DCNM actually and a Master VSM interestingly enough.  Per them, &quot;Create Master VSM with all the needed profiles and network configuration. Use the running config to create exact config across all other Nexus 1000V VSMs. Changes made to master VSM can be replicated to all other VSMs.&quot;  <br /><br />Replicated might mean manual scripting as you call the cut-and-paste variant without DCNM.<br /><br />-Jason (@jedelman8)",
