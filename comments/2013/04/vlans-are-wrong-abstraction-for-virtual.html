            <div class="comment-content">VLANs tend to be a container for a subnet which is used to help scale routing (prefixes, keeping IP control plane less busy, etc).  VLANs give you network containers (luns) while a bump-in-the-wire firewall like vGW would give you application-level/intended access (files) and maybe other useful actions.  In cloud environments, load-balancing is trending towards falling into the application developers domain (where it rightfully belongs) using software like haproxy.  Generally the creation of the network container/subnet is a separate workflow from the creation of role-based policy.  I suspect this model won&#39;t change much even with hypervisor-based overlays, even down to a low level separation of forwarding vectors from ACLs.  When you say VLANs are the wrong abstraction, I read it as you saying subnets are the wrong abstraction; but maybe that is what you are saying?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Whether subnets (and inter-subnet firewalls) are the right abstraction or not is a different story (but thanks for another topic). While subnets help to scale routing at large scales, that problem might be less relevant within virtual networks, where every &quot;Intranet&quot; (app stack) has only a few hundred nodes.<br /><br />The 802.1Q VLANs are wrong abstraction because they tightly couple virtual constructs (virtual networks = files) with physical reality (VLAN = LUN).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan, is a VLAN not the right abstraction, or have we (yes that collective we) simply not created the translation, mapping and provisioning layers that come with files on a filesystem or VMs on a CPU?<br /><br />Outside of the limitation of the number (4K is not enough), if we had created tools and protocols that would hide all this, perhaps a VLAN would have been just fine. Kind of like what is happening now in overlays :-)<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">@fullmesh - &quot;In cloud environments, load-balancing is trending towards falling into the application developers domain (where it rightfully belongs) using software like haproxy.&quot; That depends on what you want to load balance, network traffic or applications like web traffic.  Also VLANs aren&#39;t necessarily to scale routing, but to abstract a subnet across switch hardware.<br />Ivan - an IP phone call is a VLAN that gets priority routing due to the time budget being so small.  Are you saying VM&#39;s should speak via an API?  The problems show up because you can have a fail-over VM in another data center with the same IP?  Or the server can move to another part of the network ala &#39;vmotion&#39; . . . The network needs to catch up or the problem needs to get fixed like DNS resolution, arp cache or whatever the issue is when the VM moves.  Maybe the applications just need to do federation so it will matter less where it is.  Maybe just by making the app less IP bound. <br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">The only way to move forward is to make applications less IP-bound and more fault-tolerant. Everything else is a kludge.<br /><br />As for &quot;priority routing&quot; - do you get that when writing a critical file content onto your disk? Do you care? Why not? ... and how is that relevant to virtual networks within a cloud-scale data center?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">To answer your question, yes. I can set QOS on disk access within the virutal environment. Some storage arrays support this QOS as well. <br /><br />The issue many virtual environments struggle with is that network solutions refuse to integrate. I would love to create a &quot;virutal switch&quot; and publish it to the physical network. Need a new segment(VLAN), FW policy, route, etc. to support a new workload? Why not provision it as part of the VM deployment? <br /><br />VLANs may or may not be the right solution. It is what we have at this time. IPv6 will change some of this, but segmentation is required by legacy security controls. <br /><br />If we look at networks as a highway/road system, then the controls lie at the edge (home/driveway) with monitors in the flow. Conversely, todays&#39; networks assume the edge to be dumb with intellegience centralized. </div>
