      "html": "The Open vSwitch kernel module technique, of sending the first packet of each microflow to userspace, works really well in a variety of situations, but there are still some where we need better performance.  We&#39;re working on a couple of different approaches for Open vSwitch 1.12 and later.  My talk at HackerDojo in March covered some of this toward the end (you can find the slides on openvswitch.org&#39;s Documentation page and I think that video is on youtube somewhere as well).",

      "html": "Great post.  Cleared things up for me.  I had been assuming standard MAC learning was still being done local to a tenant&#39;s OVS kernel module.<br /><br />On the other hand, you compare it to VSG.  One is sold as a [light weight] FW and one is not although Nicira does have &quot;Cloud Network Security&quot; on their website. Interesting.  <br /><br />I suspect after reading this post that VMware will go from offering a per-host user space FW like vShield App to a full blown stateful distributed FW in kernel space that dynamically builds its policy as new flows are checked.  Their technology can do this already - just need to add inspection engines.<br /><br />-Jason<br />",

      "html": "OVS does not yet support the concept of Groups as described in the OpenFlow 1.1 onward specifications. Using Groups one can forward packet to multiple ports I think. I want to send a packet to the controller as well as forward it to a different port on the switch. I am using OVS as my switch. Now since I can only think of using Groups as the method to forward pkts to both the controller and the port and since OVS does not support Groups, is there a way to do this in the current version of OVS?<br />",
