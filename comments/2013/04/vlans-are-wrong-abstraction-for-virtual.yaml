    html: Whether subnets (and inter-subnet firewalls) are the right abstraction or
      not is a different story (but thanks for another topic). While subnets help
      to scale routing at large scales, that problem might be less relevant within
      virtual networks, where every &quot;Intranet&quot; (app stack) has only a few
      hundred nodes.<br /><br />The 802.1Q VLANs are wrong abstraction because they
      tightly couple virtual constructs (virtual networks = files) with physical reality
      (VLAN = LUN).

  html: VLANs tend to be a container for a subnet which is used to help scale routing
    (prefixes, keeping IP control plane less busy, etc).  VLANs give you network containers
    (luns) while a bump-in-the-wire firewall like vGW would give you application-level/intended
    access (files) and maybe other useful actions.  In cloud environments, load-balancing
    is trending towards falling into the application developers domain (where it rightfully
    belongs) using software like haproxy.  Generally the creation of the network container/subnet
    is a separate workflow from the creation of role-based policy.  I suspect this
    model won&#39;t change much even with hypervisor-based overlays, even down to
    a low level separation of forwarding vectors from ACLs.  When you say VLANs are
    the wrong abstraction, I read it as you saying subnets are the wrong abstraction;
    but maybe that is what you are saying?

    html: 'Marten, we can&#39;t get away from the sad reality - we have failed as
      miserably as OS/360 with DLBL/EXTENT statements has failed when faced with early
      Unix, VAX/VMS or even MS-DOS.<br /><br />No amount of translation, mapping and
      provisioning will change the basic facts: like SAN and storage arrays have no
      business being involved in file creation and directory lookups, networking devices
      and transport fabrics have no business being tightly coupled to inter-hypervisor
      communication.'

  html: Ivan, is a VLAN not the right abstraction, or have we (yes that collective
    we) simply not created the translation, mapping and provisioning layers that come
    with files on a filesystem or VMs on a CPU?<br /><br />Outside of the limitation
    of the number (4K is not enough), if we had created tools and protocols that would
    hide all this, perhaps a VLAN would have been just fine. Kind of like what is
    happening now in overlays :-)<br />

    html: The only way to move forward is to make applications less IP-bound and more
      fault-tolerant. Everything else is a kludge.<br /><br />As for &quot;priority
      routing&quot; - do you get that when writing a critical file content onto your
      disk? Do you care? Why not? ... and how is that relevant to virtual networks
      within a cloud-scale data center?

    html: 'To answer your question, yes. I can set QOS on disk access within the virutal
      environment. Some storage arrays support this QOS as well. <br /><br />The issue
      many virtual environments struggle with is that network solutions refuse to
      integrate. I would love to create a &quot;virutal switch&quot; and publish it
      to the physical network. Need a new segment(VLAN), FW policy, route, etc. to
      support a new workload? Why not provision it as part of the VM deployment? <br
      /><br />VLANs may or may not be the right solution. It is what we have at this
      time. IPv6 will change some of this, but segmentation is required by legacy
      security controls. <br /><br />If we look at networks as a highway/road system,
      then the controls lie at the edge (home/driveway) with monitors in the flow.
      Conversely, todays&#39; networks assume the edge to be dumb with intellegience
      centralized. '

  html: '@fullmesh - &quot;In cloud environments, load-balancing is trending towards
    falling into the application developers domain (where it rightfully belongs) using
    software like haproxy.&quot; That depends on what you want to load balance, network
    traffic or applications like web traffic.  Also VLANs aren&#39;t necessarily to
    scale routing, but to abstract a subnet across switch hardware.<br />Ivan - an
    IP phone call is a VLAN that gets priority routing due to the time budget being
    so small.  Are you saying VM&#39;s should speak via an API?  The problems show
    up because you can have a fail-over VM in another data center with the same IP?  Or
    the server can move to another part of the network ala &#39;vmotion&#39; . . .
    The network needs to catch up or the problem needs to get fixed like DNS resolution,
    arp cache or whatever the issue is when the VM moves.  Maybe the applications
    just need to do federation so it will matter less where it is.  Maybe just by
    making the app less IP bound. <br />'

  html: If &quot;virtual networks&quot; are nothing more than applications (presumably
    running in their own VM), then I assume you can create multiple virtual networks
    by running multiple instances of this application on the same physical machine
    (rather than configuring VLANs on a single instance of Open vSwitch, for example)?
