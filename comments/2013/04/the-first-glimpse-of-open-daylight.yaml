    html: Ah, so you want your app to program the network devices directly without
      going through the extra fat. <br /><br />I guess you&#39;re also programming
      SCSI/ATA adapter on your server directly from your web app to avoid the extra
      fat of Linux file system and device driver.

    html: 'Is it fair to say that OpenDaylight can be seen as full and modular Networking
      Operating System for SDN?<br /><br />It looks like a massive piece of work to
      do only for some valid scenarios.<br /><br />When do you see Open Daylight in
      a position to play a role and compete with existing traditional networking solutions?
      If you ask which ones, I would say the 90% which are not covered by Google,
      FB, Amazon, and the other big SDN contributors.<br /><br />Last but not least,
      how IPSec would be handled in such model? Would it need to be added to Openflow? '

  html: I see four layers of extra fat on the diagram.<br />What kind of problem is
    this going to actually solve? <br />By the time a so-called App will talk to the
    network, there will be a new component to comply with in at least one layer...<br
    />I get the openflow idea; SDN is how to give the power to App guys rather than
    Networking guys but really the OpenDaylight thingy is hard to relate to simpler/quicker/better
    solution
