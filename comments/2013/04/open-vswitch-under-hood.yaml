  html: The Open vSwitch kernel module technique, of sending the first packet of each
    microflow to userspace, works really well in a variety of situations, but there
    are still some where we need better performance.  We&#39;re working on a couple
    of different approaches for Open vSwitch 1.12 and later.  My talk at HackerDojo
    in March covered some of this toward the end (you can find the slides on openvswitch.org&#39;s
    Documentation page and I think that video is on youtube somewhere as well).

  html: Great post.  Cleared things up for me.  I had been assuming standard MAC learning
    was still being done local to a tenant&#39;s OVS kernel module.<br /><br />On
    the other hand, you compare it to VSG.  One is sold as a [light weight] FW and
    one is not although Nicira does have &quot;Cloud Network Security&quot; on their
    website. Interesting.  <br /><br />I suspect after reading this post that VMware
    will go from offering a per-host user space FW like vShield App to a full blown
    stateful distributed FW in kernel space that dynamically builds its policy as
    new flows are checked.  Their technology can do this already - just need to add
    inspection engines.<br /><br />-Jason<br />

    html: There are a few mailing lists dedicated to OVS and monitored by OVS developers.
      Don&#39;t you think that would be a better place to ask such a detailed question?

  html: OVS does not yet support the concept of Groups as described in the OpenFlow
    1.1 onward specifications. Using Groups one can forward packet to multiple ports
    I think. I want to send a packet to the controller as well as forward it to a
    different port on the switch. I am using OVS as my switch. Now since I can only
    think of using Groups as the method to forward pkts to both the controller and
    the port and since OVS does not support Groups, is there a way to do this in the
    current version of OVS?<br />
