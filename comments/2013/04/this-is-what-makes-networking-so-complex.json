TCP is really the <br />&gt;most expensive part of your data center (for <br />&gt;whatever reason the original blog post is long <br />&gt;gone).<br /><br />This makes me think that the whole situation is profitable... And who&#39;s sitting in the chairs of standards bodies, mostly? There seems to be a time for a little conspiracy theory to rise...<br />",

That is why security, instability, complexity, etc runs ramped. People just copy/paste a million different things they found by searching google into their CLI or source file until it &quot;works.&quot; They they call it done and let it become someone else&#39;s problem.<br /><br />So...who knows...perhaps an apple-esq frontend for all the shat-tards out there is worth it. As long as that minimalistic interface is doing things correctly in the background. There is a reason people who put in SonicWall&#39;s consider themselves &quot;network engineers.&quot; People be stupid. Can&#39;t fix that. Can&#39;t change that. Wish we could, but we might as well capitalize off that reality! W00t. $$",

The SAL is a service data plane that establishes and maintains connectivity to replicated services. With Serval, end-points can seamlessly change network addresses, migrate flows across interfaces, or establish additional flows for efficient and uninterrupted service access.</i>",
