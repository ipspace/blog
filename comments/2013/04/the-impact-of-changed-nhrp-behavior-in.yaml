  html: The procedure is not exactly the same with phase 3 config, although net result
    of not being able to establish IPsec session will be same.<br />Just figured it&#39;s
    worth a note ;-)

  html: AFAIR, dual-hub-single-cloud implementations are discouraged because of slow
    convergence issues on H1 failure, regardless of NAT behavior, precisely because
    of NHRP expiration timers.<br /><br />I remember reading Cisco recommending redundant
    single-hub clouds and letting an IGP take control.

  html: '&quot;AFAIR, dual-hub-single-cloud implementations are discouraged&quot;
    ... and how exactly are we supposed to build large-scale Phase 3 clouds? ;)<br
    /><br />Single-hub multi-cloud recommendation was definitely made (and it makes
    a lot of sense, I use it wherever possible), but then they had to deviate from
    it to support larger environments.'
