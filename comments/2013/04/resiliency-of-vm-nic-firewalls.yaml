    html: You can control (and reserve) vmkernel resources as well. See my post here:http://fojta.wordpress.com/2013/04/19/hypervisor-overhead-reservable-vs-raw-compute-resources/

  html: 'Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Thanks for the detailed response. :) I probably should
    have been a bit clearer in my first comment - I meant kernel module firewalls,
    rather than simply VNIC-level ones. In addition to Juniper&#39;s vGW, there is
    one from Checkpoint (Security Gateway Virtual Edition, which can be either deployed
    either in a VM, which can&#39;t do VNIC-level filtering IIRC, or as a kernel module,
    which I&#39;m almost certain can).<br /><br />When talking about the host resource
    consumption, another clarification is probably in order: I&#39;m not too fussed
    about VM-based firewalls, because you can explicitly control host resources available
    to VMs; however when it comes to kernel modules, I&#39;m much less sure and comfortable.
    I&#39;m also not quite sure what DRS can do if a kernel module gets &quot;hot&quot;,
    starving the host.<br /><br />Now, here&#39;s another consideration: if I understand
    it correctly, VNIC-level firewalls are deployed one or a redundant pair per host,
    and have to serve *all* VMs running on that host. On the other hand, &quot;regular&quot;,
    non-VNIC firewalls, can be deployed in multitude (one or more per customer, spread
    across different hosts, and potentially shuffled around by DRS), which in my eyes
    is a more scalable way of doing things, plus if one of them is hosed, it&#39;s
    only affects one customer.<br /><br />Hope this makes sense..'

    html: Do you mean &quot;not true&quot; in the sense that not all VMs *have* to
      go via VSG, but only those that are explicitly configured to do so?<br /><br
      />If yes, it doesn&#39;t change the premise of my comment then. If not, could
      you please clarify?<br /><br />-- Dmitri

    html: With Cisco&#39;s VSG each HA pair is responsible for one tenant and manages
      all the security policies for VMs belonging to that tenant across up to 64 hosts.
      <br /><br />VSG policies are then applied to port-profiles on the Nexus 1000V
      which are then applied to virtual machines (to a VMware admin this is just picking
      the network label in the drop-down to assign it to a particular network).<br
      /><br />The actual traffic is switched locally by the hypervisor (the Nexus
      1000V VEM module built into ESX to be specific), only the first packet of a
      new conversation is checked against the VSG, then a rule is basically cached
      on the local host and processing continues without involving VSG (until a policy
      change occurs on the VSG or the cached copy times out). <br /><br />VNMC (the
      centralized management console) can manage up to 128 VSGs (or 600 hosts).<br
      /><br />I&#39;ve had the VSG in production since August 2011 and it&#39;s been
      extremely solid for us. We&#39;ve only encountered one significant issue that
      we&#39;re still forced to workaround; overall it&#39;s been a great solution
      (and way better than private VLANs, etc.).

    html: Hi Andrew,<br /><br />Thanks for the clarification. Looks like the availability
      of the VSG services depends on the N1KV kernel module. Also I imagine that with
      only first packet going through the VSG, more complex firewall tasks requiring
      packet reassembly, etc. are probably not possible.

    html: 'Hi Serge, nice to hear from you ;)<br /><br />You probably have something
      like this in mind: http://blog.ioshints.info/2013/03/the-spectrum-of-firewall-statefulness.html<br
      /><br />If the above description of VSG is correct, then it&#39;s definitely
      a reflexive ACL firewall. Also, I don&#39;t think VEM does IP or TCP reassembly
      to check validity of TCP segments (one more argument for reflexive ACL classification).<br
      /><br />On the other hand, it would be interesting to hear what vShield App
      does that&#39;s more than that. Anything you can share?<br /><br />Thank you!<br
      />Ivan'

  html: 't would be interesting to see if the security community would consider Cisco
    VSG as a stateful firewall. Is it possible to meet that claim by checking only
    the first packet of a flow/connnection or just the handshake? Or is the VSG more
    of a reflexive ACL engine?<br /><br />Firewalls like Cisco ASA, Checkpoint, Netscreen
    &amp; the virtual counterparts like Juniper vGW, vShield Edge &amp; vShield App
    Distributed Firewall all do many checks in the connection tracking area, see some
    of the NSS &amp; ICSA criteria around those checks.<br /><br />Ivan - it would
    be interesting to do a blog around where ACLs stop and Firewalls begin and their
    intersection in the virtualization space.... '
