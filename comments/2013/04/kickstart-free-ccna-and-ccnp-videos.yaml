    html: My offering will be similar in scope to the Network Academy curriculum,
      so for those who want more explanations and details than other video training,
      this will be a good course for them. Also, the INE offer is supposedly limited
      time, this will be free forever, no strings attached.

    html: Yeah, if you don&#39;t want to have a clue about what you&#39;re doing.  By

      and interviewee end.)
