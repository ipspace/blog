    html: Enough of the big content providers have already embraced IPv6, so if NAT64
      (or whatever other CGN) is broken, the users would blame the content providers,
      not the ISP (after all, if I can complain on Facebook, and watch backflipping
      cats, Internet works, right?), so expect to see some panic deployments in the
      content world in the next few years ... consultant&#39;s dream :D

    html: The IPv6 internet is now 2% as big as the IPv4 internet, and that relative
      size doubles every 10 months. Someone at your provider clearly doesn&#39;t understand
      how exponential growth works...

  html: For users it is &quot;whatever&quot;, but it&#39;s a right/cheap move to provide
    IPv6 services for millions of users and (I hope) in the near future for everyone
    with a mobile devices. <br /><br />Unfortunately content providers don&#39;t need
    to switch as fast as they should to IPv6 services (our provider translate that
    for us... we still have 50 years for that).
