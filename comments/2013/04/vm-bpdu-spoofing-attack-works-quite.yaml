  html: Reason more to implement Nexus 1KV or similar product and have a proper switch
    in virtual access layer.

    html: You don&#39;t have BPDU Guard on vSphere 5.1, it&#39;s BPDU filter.<br /><br
      />http://blog.ioshints.info/2012/09/dear-vmware-bpdu-filter-bpdu-guard.html<br
      /><br />Nexus 1000V is no better (apart from the fact the BPDU filter is enabled
      by default ;).<br /><br />In both cases, you&#39;re preemptively killing canaries:<br

    html: Ivan your right :) BPDU Filter...<br /><br />I just want a &quot;REAL&quot;
      software switch.<br /><br />Do you have any idea why they made the FEX the way
      they did? No spanning-tree support :(<br /><br />

    html: A little bit off-topic perhaps, but I thought it might be useful to note
      that Citrix NetScaler does NOT partake in Spanning Tree. It is not possible
      to enable spanning tree on Citrix NetScaler.<br />It is best practice to enable
      &quot;Bridge BPDU&quot; mode NetScaler when operating the NetScaler in Layer
      2 mode in order to avoid accidental forwarding loops.<br />Also, with Layer
      2 mode enabled on NetScaler, it is entirely possible to configure topologies
      that will result in forwarding loops that STP cannot resolve.<br /><br /><br

    html: Just looked in the documentation .. :) and your right.<br /><br />In both
      modes of operation, L2 and L3, a NetScaler generally drops packets that are
      in:<br />w Multicast frames<br />w Unknown protocol frames destined for a NetScaler&#39;s
      MAC address (non-IP and non-ARP)<br />w Spanning Tree protocol (unless BridgeBPDUs
      is ON)<br /><br />

  html: Hi<br /><br />This happend to me...!!<br /><br />We run a Nexus network with
    FEX and on Cisco FEX you can not disable BPDU guard and BPDU filter is not an
    option.<br /><br />So one of the server guys started up a Citrix Netscaler and
    enabled spanning-tree and this took down one host at a time.<br /><br />So cluster
    = dead!<br /><br />Thank god you now have the option to enable BPDU guard on  vSphear
    5.0
