There can be significant differences in latency (I can see up to 100ms difference between continents), jitter,... Anyone has experience what can be impact of this asymmetry to VoIP, Video, SQL, or any other sensitive traffic?",

However, if you are using uniq RD and melting the routes with RT import/export, the RR will advertise all routes and not only the best ones. I that case advertise best-external will work.<br /><br />Moreover, you may achieve load-blancing on the Regional Office providing a back to back link between the CE and using multipath eibgp in a VRF lite context on the VRRP/HSRP master CE.",
