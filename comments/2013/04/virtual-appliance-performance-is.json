The systems that did most protocol decoding and little hardware offload for signature matching did the best job. Compare ISS Proventia vs Intravert - ISS was mostly software, had best decoding and was much harder to bypass with exploits with custom payload since they decoded up to the vulnerability in many cases, while signature-based hardware accelerated solutions get walked around by hackers all day long w/ polymorphic  attacks.  <br /><br />Do you want a system that can easily be updated w/ software and scale out / up as processors get faster, or do you want limited set of features that work really fast in hardware? There pros and cons for both, let&#39;s review in a decade from now and see where L4-L7 services get realized. Many arguments can be made one way or the other, but I surely would not bet against software &amp; Intel combo myself... ",

You could also go down the Cavium Octeon or network processor path, but why - given the DPDK/x86 performance capabilities. <br /><br />Also, do you really want to keep forklifting your Firewall/LB networking gear for the next rev of contract manufactured hardware or does it make sense to align with &quot;Moore&#39;s Law Networking&quot; on commodity servers? Servers upgrade cycle is 2-3 years, contract manufactured L4-L7 appliances have typically a lifecycle of 5-7 years.

However, cloud providers have caught on to these appliances and are starting to charge for CPU more than disk in some cases.<br /><br />That said, there are many hardware appliances that far outstrip their virtual brethren simply because of hardware acceleration. In the case of load balancing, SSL stripping and re-encryption CANNOT be done at line-rate without specialized hardware. The same goes for HTTPS inspection of UTM, IPS, and firewall traffic. Packet-forwarding is a quaint topic. Claiming high through-put for routing pretty much means nothing as those functions are increasingly commodity and being stuffed in devices that are capable of much more. If you think stateful firewalls still make your network safe, you need to lift the rock you have been living under.<br /><br />Sorry to be so harsh, but some of these articles are very myopic and don&#39;t really address the issues of a modern network. That is why the state funded phrackers (my word, it is a play on water-fracking for natural gas, because this is analogous to how modern &#39;hackers&#39; mine data from networks) pwn you.<br />",
