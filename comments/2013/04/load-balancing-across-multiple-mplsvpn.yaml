    html: Hi Michal - Let me know how you achieved this. I am looking for similar
      solution. Please share how you are able to achieve the load balancing across
      the different service provider.

    html: Hi Michal and Rajeev,<br /><br />can you please explain how to achieve load
      sharing. i am using the same kind of network. but we are using both the links
      as &quot; Primary - secondary&quot; . Please help us to use both the links efficiently
      to get better throughput<br />

  html: I&#39;m facing similar problem but I&#39;m still not sure if I want to load-balance
    across the different providers because it will inevitably led to antisymmetric
    routing. There can be significant differences in latency (I can see up to 100ms
    difference between continents), jitter,... Anyone has experience what can be impact
    of this asymmetry to VoIP, Video, SQL, or any other sensitive traffic?

    html: '&quot;Best external&quot; would speed up the convergence @ RR (because
      the alternate path would already be available), but even if you configure &quot;additional
      paths&quot; the RR would not advertise the backup path (advertised by one of
      the edge routers) to its clients, because the backup path would be significantly
      different from the best one (or the edge router would not prefer the iBGP path
      and you wouldn&#39;t need the best external).<br /><br />Hmm ... maybe I should
      do a short video explaining these concepts ;)'

    html: Actually, i was referring solely to the AddPath feature and not to this
      or any particular scenario ;) just meant to note that AddPath and &quot;best
      external&quot; are usually tightly coupled - and they truly are!<br /><br />sorry
      if the context of my comment wasn&#39;t clear

    html: Humm, depend on how you have configured your MPLS cloud. If you use the
      same RD, you have to tweak the RR to let it advertise more than one path. However,
      if you are using uniq RD and melting the routes with RT import/export, the RR
      will advertise all routes and not only the best ones. I that case advertise
      best-external will work.<br /><br />Moreover, you may achieve load-blancing
      on the Regional Office providing a back to back link between the CE and using
      multipath eibgp in a VRF lite context on the VRRP/HSRP master CE.

    html: The RD trick works great in MPLS/VPN environments (and yes, best external
      would definitely be propagated to all PE routers in that scenario), but not
      in pure IP forwarding or IP-in-global-table ones.<br /><br />Also, for EIBGP
      multipath you need MPLS forwarding toward IBGP next hop and MPLS label attached
      to the IBGP route (that&#39;s the only way to prevent forwarding loops), so
      I don&#39;t think VRF lite context is enough; you&#39;d probably need full-blown
      MPLS/VPN.

  html: 'regarding the last bullet, one comment if i may. In order to have a path
    diversity in the RR in the first place you would usually need something like &quot;best
    external&quot; on the regional office peering routers '

  html: assuming the requirement to use both paths is to increase the available bandwidth
    between the ROBO &amp; HQ / DC locations this poses a challenge in the event of
    the loss of one of the paths as you would immediately loose ~ 50% of your capacity
    which could adversely impact up on users / applications (though QoS may reduce
    this for key functions).<br /><br />A potential alternate may be to use Traffic
    Engineering to move certain traffic patterns to the second provider such as backups,
    bulk transfers, email, internet access, etc. <br /><br />additionally depending
    on the mpls carriers service offering the use of scavenger class for this traffic
    in the event of a link failure as part of a QoS policy may provide a more robust
    if admittedly more complex solution

    html: I&#39;ve seen the first link - where do you think I got the idea but from
      this blog (although we started running things that way at my previous $dayjob
      circa 2008; I have the feeling it was an earlier post that I intellectually
      pirated)? :)  Next I&#39;ll start suggesting he run IPSLA/EEM from the spokes
      over those same tunnels...<br /><br />I&#39;ve not seen the second (although
      I have seen the first of his referenced papers), but I like very much a default
      position of assuming all L3VPN products are essentially Byzantine, if you care
      enough about your packet delivery.<br />

  html: 'Another way to solve the AS-path issue: run a dual DMVPN mesh (one over each
    carrier), run BGP over the tunnels (and if he desires, stop running BGP with the
    carrier, leaving nothing but the transit links in the carrier&#39;s VPN table).  Then
    he also really gets to reap the benefits of using two carriers, since he&#39;ll
    stop relying on the carriers&#39; ability to withdraw prefixes when they should
    (and he&#39;ll control his own fate wrt choosing which network is blackhole-free
    at any given time). :)<br /><br />(or if he&#39;s using a platform with multi-hop
    BFD, use that along with multi-hop BGP from spoke to hub, advertise prefixes to
    carriers with no-export.  Either way, solve the AS-path problem and actually gain
    the resilience you thought you were buying with two carriers, in return for some
    possibly-annoying complexity)'

  html: Sounds like a job best suited for Performance Routing (aka Optimized Edge
    Routing).  Can also solve some of Michal&#39;s concerns around jitter and latency
    by keeping traffic balanced based on destination prefix and by monitoring for
    deterioration in latency conditions while also aiming to keep utilization roughly
    equivalent between the two links.
