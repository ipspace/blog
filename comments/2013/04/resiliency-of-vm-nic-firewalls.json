      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Thanks for the detailed response. :) I probably should have been a bit clearer in my first comment - I meant kernel module firewalls, rather than simply VNIC-level ones. In addition to Juniper&#39;s vGW, there is one from Checkpoint (Security Gateway Virtual Edition, which can be either deployed either in a VM, which can&#39;t do VNIC-level filtering IIRC, or as a kernel module, which I&#39;m almost certain can).<br /><br />When talking about the host resource consumption, another clarification is probably in order: I&#39;m not too fussed about VM-based firewalls, because you can explicitly control host resources available to VMs; however when it comes to kernel modules, I&#39;m much less sure and comfortable. I&#39;m also not quite sure what DRS can do if a kernel module gets &quot;hot&quot;, starving the host.<br /><br />Now, here&#39;s another consideration: if I understand it correctly, VNIC-level firewalls are deployed one or a redundant pair per host, and have to serve *all* VMs running on that host. On the other hand, &quot;regular&quot;, non-VNIC firewalls, can be deployed in multitude (one or more per customer, spread across different hosts, and potentially shuffled around by DRS), which in my eyes is a more scalable way of doing things, plus if one of them is hosed, it&#39;s only affects one customer.<br /><br />Hope this makes sense..",

          "html": "With Cisco&#39;s VSG each HA pair is responsible for one tenant and manages all the security policies for VMs belonging to that tenant across up to 64 hosts. <br /><br />VSG policies are then applied to port-profiles on the Nexus 1000V which are then applied to virtual machines (to a VMware admin this is just picking the network label in the drop-down to assign it to a particular network).<br /><br />The actual traffic is switched locally by the hypervisor (the Nexus 1000V VEM module built into ESX to be specific), only the first packet of a new conversation is checked against the VSG, then a rule is basically cached on the local host and processing continues without involving VSG (until a policy change occurs on the VSG or the cached copy times out). <br /><br />VNMC (the centralized management console) can manage up to 128 VSGs (or 600 hosts).<br /><br />I&#39;ve had the VSG in production since August 2011 and it&#39;s been extremely solid for us. We&#39;ve only encountered one significant issue that we&#39;re still forced to workaround; overall it&#39;s been a great solution (and way better than private VLANs, etc.).",

Also, I don&#39;t think VEM does IP or TCP reassembly to check validity of TCP segments (one more argument for reflexive ACL classification).<br /><br />On the other hand, it would be interesting to hear what vShield App does that&#39;s more than that. Anything you can share?<br /><br />Thank you!<br />Ivan",

      "html": "t would be interesting to see if the security community would consider Cisco VSG as a stateful firewall. Is it possible to meet that claim by checking only the first packet of a flow/connnection or just the handshake? Or is the VSG more of a reflexive ACL engine?<br /><br />Firewalls like Cisco ASA, Checkpoint, Netscreen &amp; the virtual counterparts like Juniper vGW, vShield Edge &amp; vShield App Distributed Firewall all do many checks in the connection tracking area, see some of the NSS &amp; ICSA criteria around those checks.<br /><br />Ivan - it would be interesting to do a blog around where ACLs stop and Firewalls begin and their intersection in the virtualization space....
