  html: SMI-S is definitely being used by products such as HP Storage Essentials,
    and IBM&#39;s TPC.

  html: Ivan,<br /><br />Yes, there are steps in the IETF process that could be optimized
    away, noone (hopefully) argues that. <br /><br />Now, it would be very interesting
    to hear your opinion on the technical aspects on CIM/SMI-S (especially the CIM
    part) and NETCONF/YANG if you had time/interest to dive into them in more detail.<br
    /><br />Interestingly enough I&#39;ve had several requests over the last few weeks
    to translate CIM models (there are many of them) and also TR-69/181 models into
    YANG to be accessed using NETCONF (and REST). Perhaps there is some timesaving
    to be done here?<br /><br />Also; keep an eye out for I2RS that seems to be gravitating
    towards NETCONF/YANG perhaps for some real technical reasons?<br /><br />

    html: Reading VMware API documentation, it seems vSphere/vCenter could be a SMI-S
      provider (and even there they&#39;d have a separate VM doing the proxying).
      <br /><br />I haven&#39;t found anything telling me how VMware uses SMI-S to
      discover storage or LUNs (for example), they only thing I found in the direction
      ESX-&gt;storage was VASA (http://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vsphere/storage-api.html#awareness)

    html: What I&#39;ve been able to find out is vSphere 4 used to have SMI-S support
      (which had to be explicitly enabled), but apparently VMware moved on in vSphere
      5 to their own API (vSphere Aware Storage Array), which they recommended storage
      vendors to implement.<br /><br />So, clear as mud, I guess. :)

  html: We have just installed Cisco&#39;s DCNM to manage our nexus 5k switches, and
    noticed of the SMI-S agent option during the installation process. I dont know
    what it supports or how it works, but there it is...<br /><br />Thanks for this
    fantastic blog :-)
