The ICMPv6 packet with message &quot;MTU too big, here&#39;s my MTU&quot; is sent from you on-link-neighbour device... I agree with the pMTUd issues where the &quot;bottleneck&quot; is somewhere remotely in the path, no doubt - but locally? Do you expect the CPE vendors to be so short-sight not to make this work?",
