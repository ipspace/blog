      "html": "In enterprise environments, especially when utilizing Juniper devices, it&#39;s actually more common to use RSVP-only based LSPs and not to run LDP at all. Works just fine, if you don&#39;t need to add new PE-routers too often. And if you have an NMS with provisioning possibility, it doesn&#39;t even matter if you add more routers every now and then. Of course the network will require a lot more state information which has to be soft-refreshed every now and then, but if we are talking about &lt;100 PE-routers, it&#39;s not a problem with current hardware having a lot of CPU and ASIC-based processing power.",

      "html": "I just did a test of MPLS VPN over TE-FRR with LDP enabled.  When doing ping, the packets goiong trough the backup tunnel have 3 stacked labels. The top one should be RSVP-LABEL for backup LSP. ,However the return packets   have only 2 labels. The top one should be LDP-LABEL and inner one should be VPN label. This means that the return traffic has to wait the convergence of IGP, which will damage the FRR advantage.<br /><br />My question is: Fast reroute is only for one direction of traffic. could we do two directions? <br />",

This allows you to have the end to end LDP path protected by MPLS-TE FRR, which is quite nice as it does not have much state.<br /><br />I was just looking at similar ways to do the same on Juniper. Initial thoughts would be partitioned auto tunnel mesh groups with link protection and ldp-tunneling. Haven&#39;t tried it yet, but any thoughts as to the viability of that?",
