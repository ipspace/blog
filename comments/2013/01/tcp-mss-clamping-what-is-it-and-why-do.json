Would it also work on the WAN interface when using crypto maps?<br />To explain: the CE router has a LAN Interface and 2 WAN Interfaces, one pointing to MPLS, one to Internet (for IPSec). I need to set the adjust-mss for only the IPSec Traffic without reducing the value for MPLS traffic. Will it work, if I only set it on the WAN interface pointing to the internet? (IPSec is done with crypto map).",
