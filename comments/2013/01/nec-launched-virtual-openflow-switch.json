It&#39;s not quite clear to me.  Could you explain a bit?<br /><br />Isn&#39;t it easier to configure hypervisors than managing switch state?<br />",

      "html": "Ivan, thanks for pointing out that medium-sized businesses have quite different problems and challenges than the large cloud providers when it comes to SDN.<br /><br />It seems to me that everyone&#39;s chasing solutions that scale up to enormous cloud networks, but the reality is that relatively few of us will work on networks of that scale. Most of us have real problems today, on typical medium-size networks, that as you say have tens of physical machines and hundreds of VMs. <br /><br />Looking forward to the webinar. 5AM my time (ouch).",

          "html": "Well, yes, the vendors... definitely the harder part.<br /><br />Programmers already face the mapping challenge in the current environment.<br /><br />Multihomed servers are a source of problems today (asymetric routing paths and L2 switch flooding all your neighbors comes to mind). Basically servers don&#39;t need too much routing intelligence, they could just send trafic back to the interface it came in from (that&#39;s more or less what I&#39;ve done on a Linux box recently). With some basic security screening we could even revive ICMP redirects.<br /><br />Except for the vendor part, I think this is doable (can&#39;t be worse than bridging, no?)",
