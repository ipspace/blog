  html: Hehe. Why do we always seem to research the same stuff at the same time :-)<br
    /><br />I had the assigning DHCPv6-IA_NA on PPPoE links problem with one of my
    customers (a CPE manufacturer). Upgraded from 15.1S to 15.2S, then to 15.2M to
    make it work. Unfortunately 15.2M doesn&#39;t support &quot;ipv6 dhcp bindings
    track ppp&quot;, but that&#39;s a different issue :-)

  html: Hi Ivan<br /><br />What is the exact difference between IA_NA and IA_PD.<br
    /><br />IA_PD is used to give IPV6 address lease to CPE routers<br /><br />IA_NA
    is used to Ipv6 address to client and it is non temporary ( normal ) IPv6 address.<br
    /><br />Can you throw some more light on this ?

  html: Thanks for this blog entry.  When I tested this last year on our 7206VXR running
    12.2SB I didn&#39;t run into this problem, only the lack of static route insertion
    for the PD.  I solved that (during testing) by manually creating the route.

  html: 'We have the same issue with some CPEs: we get hundreds (per min) of IA-NA
    requests.<br /><br />We still don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll follow your solution.
    We&#39;re currently looking for a way to limit them (x solicits per min per customer).<br
    /><br />Generally, i don&#39;t like the idea of supporting both SLAAC and DHCP
    wan ip address assignment.'

    html: Hi! Unfortunately I have no hands-on experience with IPv6 in Junos, and
      the last time I looked (but it was a long time ago) ASA had no support for IPv6
      PD, so it looks like you&#39;ll have to settle for some other platform.

  html: Hi Ivan, found this post when searching for Juniper SRX DHCPv6 PD over PPPOE
    interfaces...it appears to be broken, even though PD works over standard ethernet
    interfaces. Do you know anything more on this? Apparently it&#39;s not working
    for ASAs as well...do I really need a full router just to support v6 PD? Can I
    use DHCPv6 relay agent to work around this? Thanks!

      over PPP.

  html: Hi Ivan<br />I try to connect from a Cisco 810 (4G/LTE, over cellular interface)
    via PPP to our LNS (ASR1k). However, IPv6 doesn&#39;t work. The IPv6 protocol
    state on the virtual-access interface stays down. Important to know is that our
    mobile network (UGW) doesn&#39;t support PPP/IPV6CP. The DHCPv6 request sent by
    the CPE never touch the LNS. The question is, if IPv6 communication over PPP is
    possible at all if IPV6CP is not supported?
