    html: Fast reroute kicks in. :) Or a backup path. Or the RSVP lsp will come up
      if you signal it as loose and tie it to a loopback. Anyway if you have L3 VPN
      in your network and an lsp fails you&#39;ll have the same problems with ldp.
      Come to think of it I haven&#39;t really seen many mpls deployments without
      vpns or te around.

    html: '@Jent You can use an NMS or just script it. On Cisco you can use the auto-tunnel
      feature but I would not really recommended for a big network.'

  html: In enterprise environments, especially when utilizing Juniper devices, it&#39;s
    actually more common to use RSVP-only based LSPs and not to run LDP at all. Works
    just fine, if you don&#39;t need to add new PE-routers too often. And if you have
    an NMS with provisioning possibility, it doesn&#39;t even matter if you add more
    routers every now and then. Of course the network will require a lot more state
    information which has to be soft-refreshed every now and then, but if we are talking
    about &lt;100 PE-routers, it&#39;s not a problem with current hardware having
    a lot of CPU and ASIC-based processing power.

    html: MPLS TE tunnels are unidirectional. If you want to have FRR in both directions,
      you need two tunnels.

  html: 'I just did a test of MPLS VPN over TE-FRR with LDP enabled.  When doing ping,
    the packets goiong trough the backup tunnel have 3 stacked labels. The top one
    should be RSVP-LABEL for backup LSP. ,However the return packets   have only 2
    labels. The top one should be LDP-LABEL and inner one should be VPN label. This
    means that the return traffic has to wait the convergence of IGP, which will damage
    the FRR advantage.<br /><br />My question is: Fast reroute is only for one direction
    of traffic. could we do two directions? <br />'

  html: On Cisco, you can use one hop auto tunnel with backup (RSVP), and enable LDP
    on the RSVP tunnels. This allows you to have the end to end LDP path protected
    by MPLS-TE FRR, which is quite nice as it does not have much state.<br /><br />I
    was just looking at similar ways to do the same on Juniper. Initial thoughts would
    be partitioned auto tunnel mesh groups with link protection and ldp-tunneling.
    Haven&#39;t tried it yet, but any thoughts as to the viability of that?
