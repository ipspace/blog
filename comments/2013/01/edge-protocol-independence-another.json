      "html": "Just curious - I&#39;ve been following SDN blogs for some time.  If I understand things correctly it seems that Plexxi and Big Switch decided to drop OpenFlow in flavor of their own protocols due to either hardware just cant support Openflow well or Openflow does not have bells and whistles to do the network abstraction correctly.<br /><br />I also thought for some reason that Niciria used an openflow like technology.<br /><br />So is Openflow dead and lost the war as the nextgen Virtual Networking solution or am I completely wrong?",
