      "html": "Hi Ivan, <br /><br />I would like to extend MPLS to CPE for the below reasons. Let me know please your thought on this.<br /><br />1. Plug and Play type of service. <br />2. Provision L2 (P2P) and L3 vpn quickly. <br />3. Different CPE port for different services. <br /><br />There will be maximum 500 CPE. I am thinking of creating different ospf leaf areas and in one area to keep the CPE number below 40. Routing table size is not a issue as well (2k routes)<br /><br />From security point of view, I am planning to ue MACSEC between PE (new P) and CE(new PE) link. <br /><br />The stability of the CPE link is not a concern. <br /><br />Any advice will be great.
