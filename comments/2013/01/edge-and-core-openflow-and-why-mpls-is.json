ATT..) who are familiar with MPLS/VPNs?<br /><br />Also, in your mind, what are the key differences between contrail systems(juniper) approach and this paper?<br />",

      "html": "Not sure if we are talking here about applying OpenFlow (or strictly speaking OpenFlow-based SDN) for service provider (carrier) networks, not datacenters. If so, then I think we should distinguish between access, metro and core part of the network:<br />- For core, today MPLS is deployed, and will remain, since it is a very conservative part of the network.<br />- For metro/access, today (H-)VPLS or Ethernet (PBB) or a combination is typically deployed in many carriers.<br />OpenFlow-based SDN may make sense in the metro/access part (not in the core), as an alternative to H-VPLS or Ethernet. Dataplane could remain MPLS if required (no need to reinvent). Advantages ? No-vendor specific hardware (lower cost?) while providing flexibility on the control plane.<br />This will not be a short-term change though, from my perspective, but it is an interesting topic.",
