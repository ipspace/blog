      "html": "IMO the easiest CLI is in Linux. Create an iptables rule to match the packet and set a mark, and then create a separate routing table for that mark and add you entries there. So, if we limit ourselves to dedicated routers only, I&#39;d say the easiest is Mikrotik with RouterOS, since it also follows similar approach.<br /><br />P.S. I find JunOS CLI more convoluted than IOS in general. Too verbose, too much typing ...<br />",

      "html": "JunOS can be alot of typing, but if you do it right the templates and groups can make your work a lot easier. Staying on topic... PBR is a pain in JunOS too. Last I recall you had to at the minimum create another forwarding instance and import the connected routes, then setup a new default route for that instance and use a firewall filter to kick traffic into it.",

      "html": "Its not very original and its off the cuff but how does the following sound;<br /><br />On the basis of very familiar # ip route {src} {mask} {dst}. <br /><br /># pbr route mac 0000.1111.2222 int fa0/1 ip 10.1.1.1<br /># pbr route int fa0/0 tcp dst port 80 int fa0/2 ip 10.2.2.2<br /># pbr route ipx all int fa0/2<br /><br />While this approach is one-line configuration and lacks sophisticated if-then/flow options, I believe PBR shouldn&#39;t be used for general purpose as it doesn&#39;t scale. Rules would need to be definined, ie more specific TCP beats least specific MAC.<br /><br />This seems like a logical approach, for a scaleable CLI driven solution. <br /><br />SDN style centralised (GUI as mentioned) be an approach for complexity. But if the world wide phone system and the internet have worked with least/most specific routing (as the default underlying rules) without GUI&#39;s then PBR CLI interfaces should be able to work.",
