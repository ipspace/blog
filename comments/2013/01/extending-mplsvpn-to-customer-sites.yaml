  html: 'Hi Ivan, <br /><br />I would like to extend MPLS to CPE for the below reasons.
    Let me know please your thought on this.<br /><br />1. Plug and Play type of service.
    <br />2. Provision L2 (P2P) and L3 vpn quickly. <br />3. Different CPE port for
    different services. <br /><br />There will be maximum 500 CPE. I am thinking of
    creating different ospf leaf areas and in one area to keep the CPE number below
    40. Routing table size is not a issue as well (2k routes)<br /><br />From security
    point of view, I am planning to ue MACSEC between PE (new P) and CE(new PE) link.
    <br /><br />The stability of the CPE link is not a concern. <br /><br />Any advice
    will be great. '
