    html: Nah, it doesn&#39;t matter. MPLS will remain prevalent in WAN, people like
      the two of us will use it for scalable VRFs (and the lazy ones will opt of EVN),
      but we don&#39;t need it all over the DC (did I just say that? ;).

    html: Ivan, would you please elaborate on this comment(maybe with another blog
      :) )? <br /><br />Why will this not be naturally attractive say to the traditional
      SPs becoming cloud providers (E.g. ATT..) who are familiar with MPLS/VPNs?<br
      /><br />Also, in your mind, what are the key differences between contrail systems(juniper)
      approach and this paper?<br />

    html: Does it look to you that the &quot;Fabric Controller&quot; is nothing but
      the IGP in MPLS and the &quot;Edge Controller&quot; is MP-BGP?<br /><br />If
      that&#39;s the case.. doesn&#39;t it mean that the Fabric Controller should
      also control some aspect of the Edge node or somehow communicate with Edge Controller
      to provide IGP equivalent at those Edge nodes?<br /><br /><br />BTW..Love your
      blogs, very educational for me.

  html: It just makes sense.  SDN is MPLS but with centralization.  This could be
    the thing that makes MPLS consumable on a broader scale.

  html: Not sure if we are talking here about applying OpenFlow (or strictly speaking
    OpenFlow-based SDN) for service provider (carrier) networks, not datacenters.
    If so, then I think we should distinguish between access, metro and core part
    of the network:<br />- For core, today MPLS is deployed, and will remain, since
    it is a very conservative part of the network.<br />- For metro/access, today
    (H-)VPLS or Ethernet (PBB) or a combination is typically deployed in many carriers.<br
    />OpenFlow-based SDN may make sense in the metro/access part (not in the core),
    as an alternative to H-VPLS or Ethernet. Dataplane could remain MPLS if required
    (no need to reinvent). Advantages ? No-vendor specific hardware (lower cost?)
    while providing flexibility on the control plane.<br />This will not be a short-term
    change though, from my perspective, but it is an interesting topic.

  html: MPLS label also provides for scalability/performance and flexibility/evolution
    in the sense that no matter how many header fields would have to be dealt with
    for whatever reason, a single 20-bit label will do it now and in the future.

  html: One must also mention here Juniper&#39;s QFabric/ Stratus which came up with
    a similar overall approach around 4-5 years back (the core ideas behind the product
    would&#39;ve been firmed up much earlier than the launch). <br /><br />http://blog.ioshints.info/2012/09/qfabric-behind-curtain-i-was-spot-on.html<br
    /><br />There may be hiccups with the uptake of the product in the market for
    whatever reasons, but the basic model was spot-on.
