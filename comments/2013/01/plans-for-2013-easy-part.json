      "html": "&quot;...Some of these topics will be explained with short videos; sometimes talk-and-scribble is easier than writing a lengthy blog post.... &quot;<br /><br />If I may put in two words on this topic.  <br /><br />#1) Short videos are difficult for search engines to index today.  This makes it difficult for people to find your content when it may be helpful for them (that&#39;s how I found this blog years ago).  <br /><br />#2)  Short videos are more difficult in general to consume - they require my dedicated attention for 5-10 minutes, and worse require sound.<br /><br />That said I like videos and feel they do convey information in a different way than the written word, but don&#39;t overlook the downsides when deciding on the format!",

      "html": "#1 - I&#39;m well aware of that (I tasted SEO waters a while ago) and always provide at least a short summary. BTW, the percentage of search-triggered visits is constantly decreasing (60+% last year, 50% last month), indicating that most people who are interested in what I write have already found me (or I&#39;m drawing wrong conclusions - comment welcome).<br /><br />#2 - Not sure whether it&#39;s easier to consume a short video or an equivalent blog post. I love listening to Packet Pushers on my drive to the office and I&#39;ve had feedback from numerous people asking me to provide my materials in MP4 format so they could watch it on the the train/in gym/wherever.<br /><br />How about this: if you subscribe to the podcast feed, you&#39;ll get all videos downloaded to your fruity-device-or-its-equivalent automatically, and can watch it whenever convenient.",
