  html: Not sure I get it entirely... if your CPE runs some sort of a tunnel (6rd,
    DS-Lite, MAP-E, whatever) and uses the MTU lower than 1500 on the &quot;wan&quot;
    side, where&#39;s the issue that pMTUd would not work? The ICMPv6 packet with
    message &quot;MTU too big, here&#39;s my MTU&quot; is sent from you on-link-neighbour
    device... I agree with the pMTUd issues where the &quot;bottleneck&quot; is somewhere
    remotely in the path, no doubt - but locally? Do you expect the CPE vendors to
    be so short-sight not to make this work?

  html: You might want to watch this video http://blog.ioshints.info/2013/01/tcp-mss-clamping-what-is-it-and-why-do.html
    and think about what&#39;s going on when you establish an HTTP connection to a
    remote web server. Who is going to receive the first &quot;packet too big&quot;
    ICMP reply?

    html: But wouldn&#39;t the router send two RAs?.. one for the UGA and one for
      the ULA? Or does the router only send a single RA that includes both?

  html: 'Is it possible within IPv6 to have differently scoped addresses receive different
    MTU values? For example: the router advertisement for globally scoped addresses
    informs clients of an 1480B path but a locally scoped prefix is also advertised
    with an MTU of 9000B (or whatever the local LAN can handle)? I realize this probably
    doesn&#39;t make much sense for residential subscriber networks but could be used
    in the enterprise.'

    html: As I expected - broken design. <br /><br />You CANNOT do fragmentation over
      OTV or EoL2TP, you MUST have MTU larger than 1500 in transit network. <br /><br
      />Even if you&#39;d manage to get it to work (breaking PMTUD in the process),
      you&#39;d kill the CPU in the receiving router doing the reassembly.

    html: 'Nobody said it&#39;s not a hack. As for router sending ICMPv6 messages
      - think about a typical web browsing scenario: who will send the first oversized
      packet, who should get the first ICMPv6 packet and will it get the packet?<br
      /><br />Sending RAs with reduced MTU is always an option, but every time someone
      suggests that, there&#39;s an ivory tower crowd jumping up and down and mourning
      the loss of performance.'

  html: MSS clamping is a hack, has been and always will be. The correct solution
    is to not break pMTUd, if you have a 1492MTU then the router should be advising
    of that - if it&#39;s capable of sending out RAs, I don&#39;t see why an ICMPv6
    Fragmentation Needed should be any different. Of course, setting your RAs to advertise
    the MTU is definitely a Good Thing. since it will save hosts from periodically
    re-probing the link MTU.

  html: FWIW - IOS IP Application Services Command Reference claims that &quot;ipv6
    tcp adjust-mss&quot; was introduced with IOS XE 3.11S.<br />( http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipapp/command/iap-cr-book.html
    )<br /><br />The IPv6 experience on my 6RD residential access had deteriorated
    considerably while I was away for 2 months (probably some changes upstream) and
    the symptoms just reeked of MTU problems (endless delays, missing packets in TLS
    negotiations, timeouts, the lot!). <br /><br />&quot;ipv6 tcp adjust-mss 1400&quot;
    on the 6RD tunnel interface cured it for good.<br />
