    html: With overlay networks you still need a separate config/mgmt system to manage
      the physical network. PFC configures and manages physical and virtual switches.

  html: "I am curious about this: &quot;NVP does not touch the physical switches \u2013\
    \ a clear scalability advantage and a clear operational drawback for mid-size\
    \ enterprise environments.&quot;<br /><br />Why is &quot;not touching the physical\
    \ switches&quot; an operational drawback?  It&#39;s not quite clear to me.  Could\
    \ you explain a bit?<br /><br />Isn&#39;t it easier to configure hypervisors than\
    \ managing switch state?<br />"

  html: Ivan, thanks for pointing out that medium-sized businesses have quite different
    problems and challenges than the large cloud providers when it comes to SDN.<br
    /><br />It seems to me that everyone&#39;s chasing solutions that scale up to
    enormous cloud networks, but the reality is that relatively few of us will work
    on networks of that scale. Most of us have real problems today, on typical medium-size
    networks, that as you say have tens of physical machines and hundreds of VMs.
    <br /><br />Looking forward to the webinar. 5AM my time (ouch).

    html: I couldn&#39;t agree more with you ... but all the vendors peddling L2 DCI
      solutions (and charging for them) heftily disagree. <br /><br />Also, L3-only
      approach might require programmers to actually understand the concept of mapping
      FQDN into IP address through gethostbyname() function ... and then there&#39;s
      the &quot;slight&quot; problem of having multihomed servers with no routing
      protocol.

    html: Well, yes, the vendors... definitely the harder part.<br /><br />Programmers
      already face the mapping challenge in the current environment.<br /><br />Multihomed
      servers are a source of problems today (asymetric routing paths and L2 switch
      flooding all your neighbors comes to mind). Basically servers don&#39;t need
      too much routing intelligence, they could just send trafic back to the interface
      it came in from (that&#39;s more or less what I&#39;ve done on a Linux box recently).
      With some basic security screening we could even revive ICMP redirects.<br /><br
      />Except for the vendor part, I think this is doable (can&#39;t be worse than
      bridging, no?)

  html: Isn&#39;t it time to for replacing switches (aka bridges) with multi-port
    routers and to limit ethernet to a local link function?<br /><br />Who wants to
    spend another century with the bridge kludge that was invented to solve problems
    we don&#39;t have today (LAT and other oldies)?<br />
