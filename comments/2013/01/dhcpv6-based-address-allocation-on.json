Why do we always seem to research the same stuff at the same time :-)<br /><br />I had the assigning DHCPv6-IA_NA on PPPoE links problem with one of my customers (a CPE manufacturer). Upgraded from 15.1S to 15.2S, then to 15.2M to make it work. Unfortunately 15.2M doesn&#39;t support &quot;ipv6 dhcp bindings track ppp&quot;, but that&#39;s a different issue :-)",

Do you know anything more on this? Apparently it&#39;s not working for ASAs as well...do I really need a full router just to support v6 PD? Can I use DHCPv6 relay agent to work around this? Thanks!",

The IPv6 protocol state on the virtual-access interface stays down. Important to know is that our mobile network (UGW) doesn&#39;t support PPP/IPV6CP. The DHCPv6 request sent by the CPE never touch the LNS. The question is, if IPv6 communication over PPP is possible at all if IPV6CP is not supported?",
