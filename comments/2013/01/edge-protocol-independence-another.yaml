    html: Plexxi never went anywhere near OpenFlow (they don&#39;t need it for what
      they do), but Big Switch is still using it (AFAIK) but also relying heavily
      on OF 1.0 vendor extensions to get the job done.

  html: Just curious - I&#39;ve been following SDN blogs for some time.  If I understand
    things correctly it seems that Plexxi and Big Switch decided to drop OpenFlow
    in flavor of their own protocols due to either hardware just cant support Openflow
    well or Openflow does not have bells and whistles to do the network abstraction
    correctly.<br /><br />I also thought for some reason that Niciria used an openflow
    like technology.<br /><br />So is Openflow dead and lost the war as the nextgen
    Virtual Networking solution or am I completely wrong?
