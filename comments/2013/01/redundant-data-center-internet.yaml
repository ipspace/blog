    html: If your firewalls cause TCP timeout issues, you might want to replace them.
      Also, you&#39;ll only catch that problem (automatically) if it&#39;s a systemic
      problem affecting all sessions AND you run BGP _across_ the firewall.<br /><br
      />As for &quot;links fail as rarely as routers&quot;, I can only refer you to
      Section 2.4 of RFC 1925. You might also want to consider that a link usually
      traverses more than one device ;), not to mention the potential impact of &quot;cable
      finders&quot; (aka backhoes).<br /><br />See also http://blog.ioshints.info/2012/10/if-something-can-fail-it-will.html

  html: What about TCP timeout ? According to the proposed design, if Internet fails
    at DC1, DC2 will route back to DC1 using the same firewalls.<br /><br />If you
    had TCP timeout issues before, you&#39;ll still have issues during the Internet
    fails scenario. <br /><br /><br />I challenge the need of dual Internet connectivity
    per DC added by non-stretch firewalls (I have read the article of stretch firewalls).
    <br /><br />The 2 Internet links failure should be as rarely as the 2 routers
    failure. And If the 2 routers fails, the stretch firewalls is the solution.<br
    /><br />In the proposed design, I would still use the WAN backbone for private
    and public networks and achieve something close to load balance (lets leverage
    Load Balancers here ?) the traffic between both Internet link located in each
    DC with the use of a &quot;stretch clustering Firewall&quot;<br /><br />

    html: Absolutely agree, thanks for the feedback! <br /><br />However, you do have
      to run pretty big data centers to need a dedicated &quot;outside&quot; link.
      In that case, it might be better to go for full-blown ISP design and do optimal
      IBGP routing on the outside as well.

  html: You pretty much described the way I&#39;d do it, but although you mentioned
    &quot;these may be dark fibre&quot; you missed offering DWDM as the separation
    (and seiously, if you&#39;re only running 10g on dark fibre you&#39;re wasting
    money)
