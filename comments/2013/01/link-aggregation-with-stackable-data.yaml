    html: '&quot;Server ports must equal number of nodes in your first layer&quot;
      &lt;&lt;&lt; We&#39;re in perfect agreement, but unfortunately that&#39;s not
      what vendors are selling.'

  html: Hi, sorry, do not follow. If 4 is t to much to sell use 2 and pairs of stacked
    access switches and with local first tweak in hashing you get it done. Server
    ports must equal number of nodes in your first layer. If you follow you gain benefits
    you do not have without this. No &quot;wrong&quot; ToR any more yet closest possible
    paths.<br /><br />Tomas

  html: I have seen design documents by various vendors proposing pair of virtualized
    ToR per rack and connecting racks to core layer from two or even four chassis
    working as single logical unit. I believe there if valid sales motion behind that
    design after all :)<br /><br />Tomas

    html: Good point. Yes, there are solutions available fixing this. Either intelligent
      stack upgrade where always at least one node is forwarding or even single box
      ISSU. Certainly important to look at.<br /><br />Tomas

  html: we looked two years ago at stacked switches.  the biggest problem we saw was
    that when upgrading the firmware on the stack master it would automatically reboot
    all switches in the stack, effectively bringing down network connectivity to the
    whole rack even though servers had redundant links.<br /><br />not sure if that&#39;s
    been fixed in the past two years on the various product lines though.  just something
    to think about.
