            <div class="comment-content">This is nothing extraordinary and people were doing that for years with 1g speeds. what is extraoridinary is that they are no mpls and ipv6. I wonder what is their limit on number of boxes per ring. there is always this temptation of to get another box in.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I agree the hub/spoke topology using DWDM is nothing new at all.  The horseshoe is the physical fiber topology, also nothing new.  Your sites are limited to the number of DWDM channels (80/96) the ring can support and how much bandwidth is going to each site.   What is the cooler part is the all-IPv6 network, but part of me thinks it&#39;s way more complex than it needs to be.   The other big part of Terastream was collapsing the number of routers from a bunch to basically two at each site and then the core routers.  They are doing this by making the routers do a lot of work and not separating functions.   <br /><br />One correction you should make in the blog post:   The reality is they are still using transport systems.  The ASR9K doesn&#39;t have a coherent tunable 100G interface and coherent tunable CFP aren&#39;t quite out just yet and there is no router support for them.   The only vendor shipping a coherent tunable 100G port is Juniper on the PTX.  <br /><br />In the presentation posted they use the terms &quot;physical&quot; and &quot;logical&quot; for the packet/optical piece.  The &quot;logical&quot; solution (what they are doing today) involves using the management/control plane to make the 100GE CFP port on the router look like a tunable port by managing a 1:1 relationship with the coherent tunable port on the transport shelf, in this case Cisco M6, they even show a diagram stating &quot;iOverlay&quot; which is a Cisco term.  Cisco makes the M6 look like a transparent extension to the ASR9K but it&#39;s really connected via a transponder.   Cisco is pushing this over router coherent optics now because they can&#39;t get the density on the router.  For instance the new NCS6K will likely never have built-in DWDM optics, they will always use an add-on shelf (NCS4K/2K) and then make the transponder interconnect really cheap using CPAK/MPO cables.  You will be able to &quot;tune&quot; the port on the routers since there is a 1:1 relationship.   It looks like they have done some testing with Coriant (old NSN) and ALU transport gear as well. <br /><br />The rest of the &quot;transport system&quot; is just passive mux/demuxes and amps if you aren&#39;t using the ROADM modules.    If you don&#39;t need a multi-degree ROADM then all you need is a mux/demux.  </div>

            <div class="comment-content">It is very interesting - and I actually asked this question to one of the presenters of the design. What would be the Core Router, if there is no MPLS? By design they will have to have peering right? Then the Core Router in this design would have to have Full BGP Table (400k+ IPv4 now, 500k+ in the near future). What would be that beast, that has to have Nx100G interfaces , that has to carry at line rate the 500k+ prefixes?<br />I wasn&#39;t given an answer to this question of mine. </div>
