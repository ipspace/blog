      oresentations and talks

    html: I actually met Carl @ Interop. They also did an interesting Packet Pushers
      podcast.

  html: This is nothing extraordinary and people were doing that for years with 1g
    speeds. what is extraoridinary is that they are no mpls and ipv6. I wonder what
    is their limit on number of boxes per ring. there is always this temptation of
    to get another box in.

    html: 'Replying to my own post but further looking at the presentation what is
      crazy is they have a full mesh of actual fiber between the R2 nodes.  It must
      be nice to have access to that much fiber.  :) '

  html: 'I agree the hub/spoke topology using DWDM is nothing new at all.  The horseshoe
    is the physical fiber topology, also nothing new.  Your sites are limited to the
    number of DWDM channels (80/96) the ring can support and how much bandwidth is
    going to each site.   What is the cooler part is the all-IPv6 network, but part
    of me thinks it&#39;s way more complex than it needs to be.   The other big part
    of Terastream was collapsing the number of routers from a bunch to basically two
    at each site and then the core routers.  They are doing this by making the routers
    do a lot of work and not separating functions.   <br /><br />One correction you
    should make in the blog post:   The reality is they are still using transport
    systems.  The ASR9K doesn&#39;t have a coherent tunable 100G interface and coherent
    tunable CFP aren&#39;t quite out just yet and there is no router support for them.   The
    only vendor shipping a coherent tunable 100G port is Juniper on the PTX.  <br
    /><br />In the presentation posted they use the terms &quot;physical&quot; and
    &quot;logical&quot; for the packet/optical piece.  The &quot;logical&quot; solution
    (what they are doing today) involves using the management/control plane to make
    the 100GE CFP port on the router look like a tunable port by managing a 1:1 relationship
    with the coherent tunable port on the transport shelf, in this case Cisco M6,
    they even show a diagram stating &quot;iOverlay&quot; which is a Cisco term.  Cisco
    makes the M6 look like a transparent extension to the ASR9K but it&#39;s really
    connected via a transponder.   Cisco is pushing this over router coherent optics
    now because they can&#39;t get the density on the router.  For instance the new
    NCS6K will likely never have built-in DWDM optics, they will always use an add-on
    shelf (NCS4K/2K) and then make the transponder interconnect really cheap using
    CPAK/MPO cables.  You will be able to &quot;tune&quot; the port on the routers
    since there is a 1:1 relationship.   It looks like they have done some testing
    with Coriant (old NSN) and ALU transport gear as well. <br /><br />The rest of
    the &quot;transport system&quot; is just passive mux/demuxes and amps if you aren&#39;t
    using the ROADM modules.    If you don&#39;t need a multi-degree ROADM then all
    you need is a mux/demux.  '

  html: 'It is very interesting - and I actually asked this question to one of the
    presenters of the design. What would be the Core Router, if there is no MPLS?
    By design they will have to have peering right? Then the Core Router in this design
    would have to have Full BGP Table (400k+ IPv4 now, 500k+ in the near future).
    What would be that beast, that has to have Nx100G interfaces , that has to carry
    at line rate the 500k+ prefixes?<br />I wasn&#39;t given an answer to this question
    of mine. '
