You also need end-to-end paths (think virtual circuits), you can&#39;t update per-hop forwarding entries fast enough on topology changes.",

          "html": "Virtual circuit reminds me of TCP and also sounds like tunnel to me, like MPLS or overlay.<br /><br />Maybe I&#39;m blind, but where does OpenFlow in switch hardware fit in to this picture ? I don&#39;t think it does.<br /><br />I&#39;m sorry, but things that scale like TCP have the smarts at either end and not in the middle.<br /><br />There is just routing in the middle.<br /><br />I think can see how you might want to have OpenFlow at the Hypervisor, in a virtual switch. Especially if<br />your gonna have network functions virtualization.<br /><br />Seems to me like that really is all most people need.<br /><br />(sorry for a possible double comment, looked like it didn&#39;t go through first time ?)",

      "html": "Can OpenFlow do stateless ? I think you can specify, well basically statically configured routing by a controller, right ?<br /><br />Otherwise it might happen eventually if enough network vendors pour money into it, but it doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to me because of all the state.",
