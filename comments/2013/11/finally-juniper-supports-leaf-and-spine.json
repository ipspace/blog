      "html": "Interesting. So now there&#39;s no dedicated interconnect nodes, no external control plane and you can start a fabric with two switches back-to-back and grow as you need... Seems a lot like Brocade VCS, only 3 years later and limited to 20 nodes, with no modular chassis building block possible...<br /><br />Anyway, a few questions: what does it use internally to provide L2 ECMP? And how does it resolve MLAG for external devices? Can external devices terminate a LAG in more than two nodes within the VFC? How many? Any nodes?",
