      "html": "I agree with all of the points in the original post.  <br /><br />1) I don&#39;t consider that functionality SDN, that functionality is NFV.  SDN may enable things like service chaining of those functions, etc. but virtualization of those functions on COTS isn&#39;t SDN.   Some of the load balancer market appliances from companies like A10 don&#39;t even have custom ASICs, they are just x86 servers with custom software... Most of the the LB/FW market has already come to grips with the virtualized marketplace anyways and released VMs of their products, even Cisco. <br /><br />2)  Higher speed forwarding and aggregation still requires dedicated hardware.  The stuff in the newer switches from Cisco, Arista, and Juniper (Trident-2) is pretty close to a white-label switch and you aren&#39;t going to save much buying one from some other vendor and then using a 3rd party control plane.  The reality is all those boxes do is pretty simple forwarding already...  <br /><br />x86 servers use way more power and resources than dedicated network hardware like ASICs and NPUs, it just doesn&#39;t make any sense really for high bandwidth applications.   People have been running x86 firewalls/routers/etc. for decades now, and the bar has been raised on throughput so where I needed a Cisco router in the past maybe now I don&#39;t.   I think Cisco/Juniper realize that and is why they are coming out with virtualized versions of their OS.    <br />",

The whole point of SDN is for the application to drive the network, not the other way around.  Cisco at least has that part of it correct, when you provision through the ACIP it&#39;s driven by an application need.  If I&#39;m provisioning 10 new VMs for an application and they need a FW for a gateway, the orchestration system needs to spin up resources, figure out where the app lives, where the fw lives, and then program the network.
