            <div class="comment-content">+1<br />- Lock-ins will get wider. Prices will get higher (naturally,their is a tight dependency between the two)<br />- On the de-coupling aspect between HW and SW i do anticipate white boxes to appear and the market to go through similar process the server market went through. Current vendors will be much more &quot;SW vendors&quot;. but read again bullet #1 :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">1- SDN can move the higher level functionality of network to x86 hardware.  Load balancing, firewalling, optimization, etc.<br /><br />2- If network hardware is only responsible for simple forwarding you don&#39;t need those custom ASICs which will bring the cost of hw down.<br /><br />3- You need as many ports as you need, but you won&#39;t need any middle boxes anymore.</div>

Open any L4-7 device and check what&#39;s inside ;)<br /><br />#2 - If you think hardware shall do only simple L2/L3 forwarding, you can buy cheaper hardware today. What&#39;s stopping you? Buy Mikrotik.<br /><br />#3 - Think again. It doesn&#39;t matter whether the middle boxes run on white-label x86 servers or teal-colored boxes, if your architecture requires them, you&#39;ll have to use them one way or the other.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">1- But that is the point.  Why run it on a network device when I can run it on x86? (also see #3)<br /><br />2- Because those cheap devices aren&#39;t able to do higher level functions at all or as efficiently as their ASIC-based, more expensive counter parts.  If we move those functions to standard computing resources cheaper devices might become more viable (of course enterprises would still want enterprise level support, etc which might be a problem with some of those manufacturers.)<br /><br />3- True, but the point is not to run them on a physical device, but on virtual computing resources, where it can be provisioned and managed just like any other vm.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I agree with all of the points in the original post.  <br /><br />1) I don&#39;t consider that functionality SDN, that functionality is NFV.  SDN may enable things like service chaining of those functions, etc. but virtualization of those functions on COTS isn&#39;t SDN.   Some of the load balancer market appliances from companies like A10 don&#39;t even have custom ASICs, they are just x86 servers with custom software... Most of the the LB/FW market has already come to grips with the virtualized marketplace anyways and released VMs of their products, even Cisco. <br /><br />2)  Higher speed forwarding and aggregation still requires dedicated hardware.  The stuff in the newer switches from Cisco, Arista, and Juniper (Trident-2) is pretty close to a white-label switch and you aren&#39;t going to save much buying one from some other vendor and then using a 3rd party control plane.  The reality is all those boxes do is pretty simple forwarding already...  <br /><br />x86 servers use way more power and resources than dedicated network hardware like ASICs and NPUs, it just doesn&#39;t make any sense really for high bandwidth applications.   People have been running x86 firewalls/routers/etc. for decades now, and the bar has been raised on throughput so where I needed a Cisco router in the past maybe now I don&#39;t.   I think Cisco/Juniper realize that and is why they are coming out with virtualized versions of their OS.    <br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">&quot;SDN software runs on cheaper hardware.&quot;<br /><br />Well some manufacturers may sell their hardware at a much larger premium than other manufacturers;   if your  network is controlled using a SDN protocol,  then hardware vendors have less leverage in negotiations,  and less ability to charge you a premium,  if you can switch  to any vendor for new equipment,   and still use the same SDN protocols to manage the devices.<br /><br />&quot;Corporations can buy fewer routers and switches. It can’t get any better than this. If you need 100 10GE ports, you need 100 10GE ports.&quot;<br /><br />If you have 100 workstations yes;  it depends on how you are using those 100 GE ports.<br /><br />You might reduce your needed port count, if you can eliminate the requirement for some internal routers,  and  implement this functionality on switches instead, using a SDN protocol.<br /><br />You might reduce your required number of VLANs,  or eliminate requirements for additional physically separated switches.<br /><br />&quot;Corporations can buy cheaper [routers and switches]. Guess what – you still need the software to run them&quot;<br /><br />Yes;  what SDN controllers will cost, in terms of capital, AND the additional complexity and operating expenses to run them,  and the additional risks that SDN controllers will fail, etc, etc,  will surely be important.<br /><br />Routers may become cheaper, if SDN  strips away  manufacturers&#39;  ability to command a premium for their product,   because routers from all manufacturers seem more and more the same;  commodities,  with increased competition enabled by SDN,  prices may eventually drop.<br /><br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">I agree with almost everything you say here except that I think allowing for the control plane to operate separately from the hardware (and vendors) means that we have a better chance at using the hardware resources we buy more efficiently. That is while you might still need 100 10GE ports at the edge, you may need far fewer switches and ports in the core to get the same real performance out of your network. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">Fewer was kinda funny, I know what they mean, but it&#39;s still funny to read it. Just like the person mentioned above you might be able to use a little less hardware because of it, especially if your utilization is low.<br /><br />Buying cheaper switches ? Hmm, I actually think overlays can be a good solution.<br /><br />But I don&#39;t think I want unmanaged switches, I want to be able to get at least some basic information out of the switches. And I&#39;ve not seen cheap managed switches with less features from any major vendor.<br /><br />So what choice do we have but to buy expensive switches ?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">SDN by itself may not yield these results independently, but is part of vision wherein the physical network becomes an IP bus and the virtual network implements the controls segmentation, firewalling, inspection, etc. <br /><br />Some are as progressive as to design something with a pair of routers, a pair of switches (Arista 7000 series), and 1,000 virtual servers. 2-3 routed VLANs in hardware and the rest is done in software. Edge firewalls, DMZ, application firewalls, load balancing, VPN, and IPS are all done within software overlays. <br /><br />I may require &quot;100 ports&quot; for my datacenter, but they are now in a one hop physical network with local firewalling and routing per application bundle. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">True, but you had to manage those components individually. With &quot;SND/SDDC&quot; the technology is not the focus, rather the management and orchestration of the environment such that I can deploy an application, with network segments, with firewall policy, and IPS. <br /><br />I believe the &quot;virtual&quot; world has shown what management of IT technology should look like and now networking is being asked to do the same. Imagine a visual interface whereby you could draw the traffic flows (from host A to point B on port C), receive visual feedback, and then implement by pressing the &quot;easy&quot; button.

            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;ve seen the fancy multi-service provisioning stuff done in practice for years now.   I see the change in the ability to spin up those resources on demand using COTS boxes instead of virtualized network appliances.   <br /><br />I don&#39;t think you want to draw anything really, the network should know where the application endpoints live via some other means.   The whole point of SDN is for the application to drive the network, not the other way around.  Cisco at least has that part of it correct, when you provision through the ACIP it&#39;s driven by an application need.  If I&#39;m provisioning 10 new VMs for an application and they need a FW for a gateway, the orchestration system needs to spin up resources, figure out where the app lives, where the fw lives, and then program the network.   If you have a 1-hop network via leaf/spine or two really dense switches, there are no alternate traffic paths between two endpoints... <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
