      "html": "The article incorrectly states &quot;couldn\u2019t use MAP-E due to lack of IP address space&quot;, and also overlooks some other aspects. <br /><br />The MAP-E offers a IPv4 address sharing solution for every range of IPv4 address space possible. <br />http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-softwire-map-08<br /><br />The difference between MAP-E and lw46 are:<br />- lw46 requires the operator to maintain per user 1:1 state/binding between the IPv4 address and port-set + IPv6 address. This will be done using DHCP lease state tracking, and is thus equivalent to dynamic per subscriber subscriber state on the AFTR. The mechanism will use snooping DHCPv4 running over DHCPv6, using new extensions to both protocols.<br /><br />- MAP allows a range of Border-Relay configuration options, ranging from per subscriber domains, equivalent to Lw46, (i.e. One IPv4+port maps to a given IPv6 subscriber) to multi-subscriber domains (i.e. An IPv4 subnet is shared and mapped to multiple IPv6 subscribers). The latter is can be thought of IPv4 route aggregation and is a  useful scalability characteristic.<br />In terms of provisioning MAP-E will be relying only on DHCPv6 ((http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-softwire-map-dhcp-06), without resorting to DHCPv4 or dhcp snooping. The CPE may also be configured using TR-69.<br /><br />RIPE Presentation can be found on:<br />https://ripe67.ripe.net/presentations/136-ripe_20_dollar_cgn.pdf<br /><br />Open Source/OpenWRT on:<br />https://github.com/cernet/MAP<br />https://github.com/ayourtch/openwrt-map<br />",
