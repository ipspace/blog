SDN to me is driven by dynamic variables including applications.  <br /><br />Now back in the mid-90s we did have RADIUS options controlling things like L2TP tunnels to redirect users to a certain path like walled gardens, web-filtering boxes, etc.   Maybe you could call that SDN?   Still a tortured interpretation IMHO.  ",

What about GSMP, MSF, FORCES, and even MEGAGO (diff. use context), etc. 10+years ago efforts, some of which are still superior in many ways (in terms both architecture, functionality and  to the current &quot;new&quot; OpenFlow does it all for you BS ? For Stanford folks to market this as a new invention of theirs and take credit is ignorant and irresponsible - folks like Nick Mckeowns surely remember the previous attempts. The key problem with the industry is that everyone seems to have a self appointed &quot;right&quot; to come up with &quot;new&quot; protocol/interfaces for old things, and call it solution. No wonder folks get frustrated on the height of the RFC and other spec pile.",
