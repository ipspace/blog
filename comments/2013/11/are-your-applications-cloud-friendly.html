            <div class="comment-content">In the VoIP world I found it much easier to work with FQDNs instead of IP addresses specially when coupled with DNS SRV records. Why I waited so long, when it was really so simple? I attribute it to fear of change, or fear of having to troubleshoot a new call flow. Using DNS will also help with geographic redundancy. VoIP still has one major issue with dynamic ports for media channels. <br />But I agree with the post, I guess if we needed 1 simple talking point it is &quot;leverage DNS&quot;.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I suppose Ivan meant in his first statement: &quot;An application’s external entry point SHOULD NOT be defined by a static IP address and a static TCP/UDP port number(s)&quot;, otherwise using DNS A and SRV records would be pointless.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Static TCP/UDP port number is a must, otherwise you run into firewalling problems (you can filter static port with ACLs).<br /><br />IP address should be as static as possible (but not more than that ;), otherwise someone might start feeling the urge to negotiate it via some weird RPC protocol.<br /><br />Probably need to reword it. How about &quot;application external entry point WITHIN ONE AVAILABILITY ZONE&quot; ...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">How about trying to make the applications as OPEN and PORTABLE  as possible?<br />Regarding the firewall issues, you could use the same process to discover port numbers as applications should, i.e ... DNS(Sec)! <br />I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s possible with the security products which are available right now on the market, but it would be so much simpler to allow/ban applications (with their port numbers dynamically discovered through DNS) on Firewalls instead of manually configuring their port numbers inside ACLs or any other tools...<br />Regarding the IP address, the application SHOULD NOT know anything about it; if it needs it, there are APIs that can easily return that dynamic information from lower IPv4/IPv6 layers.<br />As a general rule, applications and network/transport layers SHOULD always be decoupled. </div>
