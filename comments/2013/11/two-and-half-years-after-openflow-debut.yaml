    html: '1- But that is the point.  Why run it on a network device when I can run
      it on x86? (also see #3)<br /><br />2- Because those cheap devices aren&#39;t
      able to do higher level functions at all or as efficiently as their ASIC-based,
      more expensive counter parts.  If we move those functions to standard computing
      resources cheaper devices might become more viable (of course enterprises would
      still want enterprise level support, etc which might be a problem with some
      of those manufacturers.)<br /><br />3- True, but the point is not to run them
      on a physical device, but on virtual computing resources, where it can be provisioned
      and managed just like any other vm.'

  html: 1- SDN can move the higher level functionality of network to x86 hardware.  Load
    balancing, firewalling, optimization, etc.<br /><br />2- If network hardware is
    only responsible for simple forwarding you don&#39;t need those custom ASICs which
    will bring the cost of hw down.<br /><br />3- You need as many ports as you need,
    but you won&#39;t need any middle boxes anymore.

  html: I agree with all of the points in the original post.  <br /><br />1) I don&#39;t
    consider that functionality SDN, that functionality is NFV.  SDN may enable things
    like service chaining of those functions, etc. but virtualization of those functions
    on COTS isn&#39;t SDN.   Some of the load balancer market appliances from companies
    like A10 don&#39;t even have custom ASICs, they are just x86 servers with custom
    software... Most of the the LB/FW market has already come to grips with the virtualized
    marketplace anyways and released VMs of their products, even Cisco. <br /><br
    />2)  Higher speed forwarding and aggregation still requires dedicated hardware.  The
    stuff in the newer switches from Cisco, Arista, and Juniper (Trident-2) is pretty
    close to a white-label switch and you aren&#39;t going to save much buying one
    from some other vendor and then using a 3rd party control plane.  The reality
    is all those boxes do is pretty simple forwarding already...  <br /><br />x86
    servers use way more power and resources than dedicated network hardware like
    ASICs and NPUs, it just doesn&#39;t make any sense really for high bandwidth applications.   People
    have been running x86 firewalls/routers/etc. for decades now, and the bar has
    been raised on throughput so where I needed a Cisco router in the past maybe now
    I don&#39;t.   I think Cisco/Juniper realize that and is why they are coming out
    with virtualized versions of their OS.    <br />

  html: "&quot;SDN software runs on cheaper hardware.&quot;<br /><br />Well some manufacturers\
    \ may sell their hardware at a much larger premium than other manufacturers; \
    \  if your  network is controlled using a SDN protocol,  then hardware vendors\
    \ have less leverage in negotiations,  and less ability to charge you a premium,\
    \  if you can switch  to any vendor for new equipment,   and still use the same\
    \ SDN protocols to manage the devices.<br /><br />&quot;Corporations can buy fewer\
    \ routers and switches. It can\u2019t get any better than this. If you need 100\
    \ 10GE ports, you need 100 10GE ports.&quot;<br /><br />If you have 100 workstations\
    \ yes;  it depends on how you are using those 100 GE ports.<br /><br />You might\
    \ reduce your needed port count, if you can eliminate the requirement for some\
    \ internal routers,  and  implement this functionality on switches instead, using\
    \ a SDN protocol.<br /><br />You might reduce your required number of VLANs, \
    \ or eliminate requirements for additional physically separated switches.<br /><br\
    \ />&quot;Corporations can buy cheaper [routers and switches]. Guess what \u2013\
    \ you still need the software to run them&quot;<br /><br />Yes;  what SDN controllers\
    \ will cost, in terms of capital, AND the additional complexity and operating\
    \ expenses to run them,  and the additional risks that SDN controllers will fail,\
    \ etc, etc,  will surely be important.<br /><br />Routers may become cheaper,\
    \ if SDN  strips away  manufacturers&#39;  ability to command a premium for their\
    \ product,   because routers from all manufacturers seem more and more the same;\
    \  commodities,  with increased competition enabled by SDN,  prices may eventually\

    html: And why would that be? Because:<br /><br />A) Vendors are clueless<br />B)
      Vendors ensure we can&#39;t squeeze most out of their boxes<br />C) We know
      so much better what to do than people who have been doing it for years if not
      decades<br />D) All of the above<br /><br />Getting a control plane to work
      reliably is hard work. Google can pull it off (and probably a few others), but
      that&#39;s it.

  html: 'I agree with almost everything you say here except that I think allowing
    for the control plane to operate separately from the hardware (and vendors) means
    that we have a better chance at using the hardware resources we buy more efficiently.
    That is while you might still need 100 10GE ports at the edge, you may need far
    fewer switches and ports in the core to get the same real performance out of your
    network. '

  html: Fewer was kinda funny, I know what they mean, but it&#39;s still funny to
    read it. Just like the person mentioned above you might be able to use a little
    less hardware because of it, especially if your utilization is low.<br /><br />Buying
    cheaper switches ? Hmm, I actually think overlays can be a good solution.<br /><br
    />But I don&#39;t think I want unmanaged switches, I want to be able to get at
    least some basic information out of the switches. And I&#39;ve not seen cheap
    managed switches with less features from any major vendor.<br /><br />So what
    choice do we have but to buy expensive switches ?

    html: True, but you had to manage those components individually. With &quot;SND/SDDC&quot;
      the technology is not the focus, rather the management and orchestration of
      the environment such that I can deploy an application, with network segments,
      with firewall policy, and IPS. <br /><br />I believe the &quot;virtual&quot;
      world has shown what management of IT technology should look like and now networking
      is being asked to do the same. Imagine a visual interface whereby you could
      draw the traffic flows (from host A to point B on port C), receive visual feedback,
      and then implement by pressing the &quot;easy&quot; button. I would love to
      manage the network from a large map view...

  html: 'SDN by itself may not yield these results independently, but is part of vision
    wherein the physical network becomes an IP bus and the virtual network implements
    the controls segmentation, firewalling, inspection, etc. <br /><br />Some are
    as progressive as to design something with a pair of routers, a pair of switches
    (Arista 7000 series), and 1,000 virtual servers. 2-3 routed VLANs in hardware
    and the rest is done in software. Edge firewalls, DMZ, application firewalls,
    load balancing, VPN, and IPS are all done within software overlays. <br /><br
    />I may require &quot;100 ports&quot; for my datacenter, but they are now in a
    one hop physical network with local firewalling and routing per application bundle. '

  html: I&#39;ve seen the fancy multi-service provisioning stuff done in practice
    for years now.   I see the change in the ability to spin up those resources on
    demand using COTS boxes instead of virtualized network appliances.   <br /><br
    />I don&#39;t think you want to draw anything really, the network should know
    where the application endpoints live via some other means.   The whole point of
    SDN is for the application to drive the network, not the other way around.  Cisco
    at least has that part of it correct, when you provision through the ACIP it&#39;s
    driven by an application need.  If I&#39;m provisioning 10 new VMs for an application
    and they need a FW for a gateway, the orchestration system needs to spin up resources,
    figure out where the app lives, where the fw lives, and then program the network.   If
    you have a 1-hop network via leaf/spine or two really dense switches, there are
    no alternate traffic paths between two endpoints... <br /><br /><br /><br />

  html: And how will the control plane talk to data plane? via a OOB network..but
    thats also a network.....will have all the inherent qualties of a regular prodcuton
    network...and even to this day,we do have cheaper vendors for routers and switches,
    we have sticked to one vendor..its US...NET ENGG who decided to go with cisco
    and of course Cisco also supported us in advancing tech in whichever way they
    could..meaning we allowed ourselves to be vendor locked..just like microsoft....and
    we will do the same in case of SDN too and hence in due course, the cost benefit
    would not remain there....it will be back to square one....
