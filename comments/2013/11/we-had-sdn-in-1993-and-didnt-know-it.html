            <p class="comment-content">I try to separate &quot;SDN&quot; and &quot;Network Automation.&quot;  Automation has been around for decades now and I&#39;d put this one under that, not necessarily SDN, even though people seem to like to spin it as SDN.   SDN to me is driven by dynamic variables including applications.  <br /><br />Now back in the mid-90s we did have RADIUS options controlling things like L2TP tunnels to redirect users to a certain path like walled gardens, web-filtering boxes, etc.   Maybe you could call that SDN?   Still a tortured interpretation IMHO.  </p>

            <p class="comment-content">We also had &quot;cloud&quot; computing in 1993-1995  Novell teamed up with AT&amp;T to host Novell servers and lotus notes service from AT&amp;T connected via frame relay. <br />Worked then but slow fat protocol over thin VCs.. But it was touted in the old rags back then. How funny, <br /></p>

            <p class="comment-content">There is a point here, this stuff is not &quot;new&quot;. What about GSMP, MSF, FORCES, and even MEGAGO (diff. use context), etc. 10+years ago efforts, some of which are still superior in many ways (in terms both architecture, functionality and  to the current &quot;new&quot; OpenFlow does it all for you BS ? For Stanford folks to market this as a new invention of theirs and take credit is ignorant and irresponsible - folks like Nick Mckeowns surely remember the previous attempts. The key problem with the industry is that everyone seems to have a self appointed &quot;right&quot; to come up with &quot;new&quot; protocol/interfaces for old things, and call it solution. No wonder folks get frustrated on the height of the RFC and other spec pile.</p>
