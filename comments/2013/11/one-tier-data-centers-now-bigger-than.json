Each switch will have redundant power supplies, and possibly redundant supervisors. You get ISSU.<br /><br />In addition, it is not all eggs in one basket. It is just more eggs than before. And I think of it as a big high quality basket. Therefore, I do not see a design failure.<br />",

I&#39;m sure it will make the guys who love structured cabling happy.   I feel sorry for the datacenter tech who is trying to track down the bad rack to rack cable to an end of row rack terminating 2000+ connections.   <br /><br />And then Cisco 1-upped them by putting 36x40GE ports on their Trident 2 box instead of the 32x40GE Arista did.",

The reality is the Cisco card uses .4W/port more than the Arista.  <br /><br />The 36x10GE card doesn&#39;t have the Insieme chip on it and won&#39;t support ACI.  Those are meant to be used on the edges of the network not in the core, so if you wanted 100G you could certainly use a 77xx switch in the same role.  ",
