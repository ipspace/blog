      "html": "I agree the hub/spoke topology using DWDM is nothing new at all.  The horseshoe is the physical fiber topology, also nothing new.  Your sites are limited to the number of DWDM channels (80/96) the ring can support and how much bandwidth is going to each site.   What is the cooler part is the all-IPv6 network, but part of me thinks it&#39;s way more complex than it needs to be.   The other big part of Terastream was collapsing the number of routers from a bunch to basically two at each site and then the core routers.  They are doing this by making the routers do a lot of work and not separating functions.   <br /><br />One correction you should make in the blog post:   The reality is they are still using transport systems.  The ASR9K doesn&#39;t have a coherent tunable 100G interface and coherent tunable CFP aren&#39;t quite out just yet and there is no router support for them.   The only vendor shipping a coherent tunable 100G port is Juniper on the PTX.  <br /><br />In the presentation posted they use the terms &quot;physical&quot; and &quot;logical&quot; for the packet/optical piece.  The &quot;logical&quot; solution (what they are doing today) involves using the management/control plane to make the 100GE CFP port on the router look like a tunable port by managing a 1:1 relationship with the coherent tunable port on the transport shelf, in this case Cisco M6, they even show a diagram stating &quot;iOverlay&quot; which is a Cisco term.  Cisco makes the M6 look like a transparent extension to the ASR9K but it&#39;s really connected via a transponder.   Cisco is pushing this over router coherent optics now because they can&#39;t get the density on the router.  For instance the new NCS6K will likely never have built-in DWDM optics, they will always use an add-on shelf (NCS4K/2K) and then make the transponder interconnect really cheap using CPAK/MPO cables.  You will be able to &quot;tune&quot; the port on the routers since there is a 1:1 relationship.   It looks like they have done some testing with Coriant (old NSN) and ALU transport gear as well. <br /><br />The rest of the &quot;transport system&quot; is just passive mux/demuxes and amps if you aren&#39;t using the ROADM modules.    If you don&#39;t need a multi-degree ROADM then all you need is a mux/demux.  ",

By design they will have to have peering right? Then the Core Router in this design would have to have Full BGP Table (400k+ IPv4 now, 500k+ in the near future). What would be that beast, that has to have Nx100G interfaces , that has to carry at line rate the 500k+ prefixes?<br />I wasn&#39;t given an answer to this question of mine. ",
