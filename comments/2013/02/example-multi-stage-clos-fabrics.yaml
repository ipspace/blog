  html: How can you support 128 spine switches if most routing protocols only provide
    8 or 16 max paths? This is a big disconnect in my understand of Clos fabric implementations.

  html: Why would you need 128 spine switches? You can have as many spine switches
    as you have uplinks on leaf switches - and many DC switches support 32-way ECMP.

  html: In the video he show 64 stage 3 spine switches connected to 128 stage 2 spine
    switches. That is the part I don&#39;t understand. Even if as you say they can
    support 32-way ECMP (which vendors support this?), that still doesn&#39;t account
    for that many switches.

  html: Hi Ivan, I don&#39;t get the math either. At leaf switches (stage 2), you
    have 4*40GE southbound, towards the access (ToR); as the fabric should be non-blocking,
    you need the same capacity northbound (to stage 3 - spine). So you can use either
    4*40GE (4 spine switches/32 leaf switches) or, to support more leaf switches,
    16*10GE (16*spine/128 leaf). Why are there 64 spine switches in the presentation?<br
    />Thanks for the explanation.
