  html: Would probably define Control plane as following<br /><br />Control plane
    is a process by which certain states are derived to aid data plane. Most of the
    protocols (BGP, OSPF...) derive states independent of data plane. Certain protocols
    like Multicast, ICMP use data plane itself to arrive at states to aid data plane.
    <br /><br />Strictly speaking, Control plane policing (CoPP) could probably be
    renamed to CPU Policing, as policies both control and data plane.
