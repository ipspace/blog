I understand that 40GbE can be configured as a break-out (4 10Gb) but I was also under the impression 40GbE uplinks can be configured as a single, 40Gb uplink - a muxed lane at layer 1, so you did not have to worry about a port channel.  <br /><br />Is this not the case on any equipment or just the 6000?",

      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />May I ask a question about a single 40G link vs 4 \u0425 10G LAG. <br /><br />Let&#39;s suppose we have two datacenters (DC) in a campus, connected via two independent optic fibers. Each DC has its own Nexus 6001. Suppose that we want to connect them via those two fibers and don&#39;t want to spend more than a single 40G port on each Nexus. (Of course we want to make this connection highly available - otherwise, why bother running two redundant fibres between the sites.) <br /><br />The easy way to accomplish this task is, obviously, the following: configure the 40G port as 4 X 10G ports, combine them in a LAG, and use fibre 1 for two 10G links of the LAG and fibre 2 for the two remaining 10G links.<br /><br />Now the interesting point: performance-wise, a 40G single link mode is said to be better than 4 X 10G mode. Does it have any kind of internal redundancy? Can we split it via the breakout cable and route via two different fibres to the likewise 40G port on a remote 6001? If yes, then will this link continue working if one of the two fibres gets broken?<br />",
