In this mode, the PE router allocates one label for every immediate next-hop (in most cases, this would be a CE router). This label is directly mapped to the next hop, so there is no VRF route lookup performed during data forwarding. However, the number of labels allocated would be one for each CE rather than one for each VRF. Because BGP knows all the next hops, it assigns a label for each next hop (not for each PE-CE interface). When the outgoing interface is a multiaccess interface and the media access control (MAC) address of the neighbor is not known, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is triggered during packet forwarding.
