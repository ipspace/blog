      "html": "Hi Ivan, I don&#39;t get the math either. At leaf switches (stage 2), you have 4*40GE southbound, towards the access (ToR); as the fabric should be non-blocking, you need the same capacity northbound (to stage 3 - spine). So you can use either 4*40GE (4 spine switches/32 leaf switches) or, to support more leaf switches, 16*10GE (16*spine/128 leaf). Why are there 64 spine switches in the presentation?<br />Thanks for the explanation.",
