      "html": "(removed and reposted due to typo)<br />This is another issue with the transition from the &quot;NAT&quot; approach to the &quot;delegate&quot; approach. Delegation means pushing network addressing &quot;down the pipe&quot;, from the core to the end devices, and we are trying to do it with DHCP.<br /><br />How much address space? How to support arbitrary levels of delegation? How to dual home? How to dynamically change addressing without long loss of connectivity?<br /><br />Interesting IPv6 debates usually revolve around the NAT/delegate shift, while less interesting but still very practical debates are about unhealthy implementations. There is also some space about DHCPv6 quirks and how it disregards MAC addresses.<br /><br />The technical leaders obviously failed to address these problems during RFC development, so now we are struggling to make IPv6 without NAT at least as useful as IPv4 with NAT, and failing in many ways.<br /><br />I see now NAT66 in Linux iptables and Cisco ASA, and this could be the premature end of the idea of pushing network addressing downwards.",

This would be useful in an SMB environment where a specific host needs a firewall rule opened (web server, mail server, etc).<br /><br />For this to work we would also need either wildcards in IPv6 ACLs or the ability to use the general-prefix in screening ACLs to account for changing IPv6 prefixes.<br /><br />",
