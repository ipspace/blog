They are not providing their VPC solution as a software package I can install and manage myself in my own DC right?",

      "html": "Excellent blogpost, as a Datacenter network guy I am still implementing L2 stretched solutions. Not only VM&#39;s need failover, also other solutions such as loadbalancers, MPLS solutions, redundant routers, ... are designed redundantly across datacenters. VXLAN seems promising for VM hot move. I guess there is no industry standard solution for this problem because of the easy setup of a strechted layer2 solution. It might also be the most economical solution too ...",

Amazing, isn&#39;t it ;)",

I don&#39;t see the difference between the different type of migration (replications) in regard to the change or not of the IP address...<br />However, the change of the IP address is always a problem, I think a Server can&#39;t change it&#39;s IP address, never. I don&#39;t know the more deep tricks about DNS, but I think that it doesn&#39;t exist a valid trick to solve on-the-fly a problem related to a migration of a VM to different DC, thinking of the cache of the PCs, the record replication time etc...",
