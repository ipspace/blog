  html: Ivan, just a comment on &quot;vendor sponsored report&quot;. It wasn&#39;t.
    Just cause HP cited it and bought the rights to reprint it for a certain time
    period (which any vendors or customers can do with any Gartner report, even all
    with the same report at the same time as is frequently done with MQs)--doesn&#39;t
    mean it was sponsored. There&#39;s no such thing at Gartner.<br /><br />-Aneel.<br
