  html: Don&#39;t forget about VPN CAM when using per-vrf labels. Or you will hit
    recirculation for overflowing vrfs (more than 512).

  html: Assigning an MPLS label per next-hop would be nice middle-of-the-road solution.
    No need to do double lookups and save lot of memory.

  html: 'On ASR9K/XR theres a third solution which avoids the extra lookup, you can
    do per next-hop label allocation<br /><br />qoute from: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios_xr_sw/iosxr_r3.6/routing/configuration/guide/rc36bgp.html#wpmkr1456095
    <br /><br />label-allocation-mode per-ce<br /><br />Configures the per-CE label
    allocation mode to avoid an extra lookup on the PE router and conserve label space
    (per-prefix is the default label allocation mode). In this mode, the PE router
    allocates one label for every immediate next-hop (in most cases, this would be
    a CE router). This label is directly mapped to the next hop, so there is no VRF
    route lookup performed during data forwarding. However, the number of labels allocated
    would be one for each CE rather than one for each VRF. Because BGP knows all the
    next hops, it assigns a label for each next hop (not for each PE-CE interface).
    When the outgoing interface is a multiaccess interface and the media access control
    (MAC) address of the neighbor is not known, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
    is triggered during packet forwarding. '

  html: This is available from 12.2(33)SXH and later on Cat 6500 and the command is
    the following:<br />mpls label mode all-vrfs protocol bgp-vpnv4 per-vrf<br /><br
    />On 12.2SR code the command is:<br />mpls label mode all-vrfs protocol all-afs
    per-vrf<br />

  html: Juniper does per next-hop (like per-ce) as well.  Configure your export policy
    like this:<br />then {<br />label-allocation per-nexthop;<br />community add vpn1;<br
    />accept;<br />}<br /><br />I don&#39;t know why this wasn&#39;t the default/standard
    from all vendors right from the start..
