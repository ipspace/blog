  html: cynical certainly but probably very accurate.

    html: You must have read only some of my blog posts ;) OpenFlow can be used or
      abused like any other technology. NEC uses is wisely, so does Nicira. <br /><br
      />Floodlight (in its vanilla incarnation) is awful, some other ideas (load balancing
      with per-flow forwarding in Internet) are simply bizarre.

  html: Wait, I thought this blog had established that OpenFlow is part of a recurring
    series of microflow failures (like IntServ). What is this interest on OpenFlow
    about?

  html: It always amazes me what can be found on Wikipedia.  Netscape still got acquired
    for $4.2B (by AOL, ha).  Not too shabby.<br /><br />Why do you have to be a cynic
    - can&#39;t we think, history WON&#39;T repeat itself? :)<br /><br />Thanks for
    sharing the Simon Wardley article.  Enjoyed that one.
