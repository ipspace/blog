  html: Would you care to explain why NSX&#39;s bringing L3 back to a already well-spanned
    L2 data centre?<br />Thanks.

    html: Stupid me ... living too deep in the acronym land :((<br /><br />N/S = North/South
      - between the app stack and the outside world. You&#39;d use NSX Edge there,
      which includes stateful firewall with active/standby failover capabilities.

    html: The NSX firewall feature in the vSwitch is scheduled for early next year
      I believe. It was covered in the briefing so I wrote about it but the details
      are sketchy. YMMV

  html: You mention that NSX Edge provides N/S firewall - n/s presumably meaning non-stateful.
    However, Greg Ferro&#39;s article in network computing (http://www.networkcomputing.com/cloud-computing/vmware-nsx-game-changer-for-data-center/240160449?pgno=2)
    states that NSX has a stateful firewall. I&#39;m probably confusing different
    aspects of the NSX solution but could you please clarify?

  html: when the nsx product will be sold?<br />from vmware website there is no nsx
    for evaluation, but as vCNS5.5 has also not good stuff like routing-protocol,
    in-kernel-firewall yet.
