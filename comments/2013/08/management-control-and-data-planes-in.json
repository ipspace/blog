Maybe routing protocols have the control-plane functionality built-in, but still there are cases where for intermediate devices they are simple data-plane traffic.<br /><br />After all C=Control in ICMP.<br /><br />Quoting from yourself (http://wiki.nil.com/Control_and_Data_plane):<br /><br />In most router implementations, the data plane receives and processes all inbound packets and selective forwards packets destined for the router (for example, routing protocol updates) or packets that need special processing (for example, IP datagrams with IP options or IP datagrams that have exceeded their TTL) to the control plane.
