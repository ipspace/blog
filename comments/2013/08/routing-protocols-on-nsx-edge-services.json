      "html": "I am not sure of how to take the review to be honest. I do not think VMWare intend NSX to be at the core of anyone&#39;s DC taking the role of hardware routers, firewalls and switches, however the value proposition is compelling for speed of  IT infrastructure provisioning and  simplifying physical netwok designs. Where the needs are basic network segmentation and application delivery this presents a compelling usecase . No boubt after its release it may require improvement but which product does not.. even Cisco&#39;s IOS after 20 years still gets bug updates and no doubt as time progresses it will become more robust not only in terms of doing the basic things right but also more features.
