    html: I did mean &quot;vShield&quot;. ESXi VXLAN kernel module is part of vShield
      (or vCNS) product and can only be configured through vShield Manager.

    html: Oh, I see what you mean. :) I&#39;d say that NV in vCNS is a part of DVS,
      but yes, it is configured in vSM, which is a bit confusing. Or more than a bit.
      :)

  html: '&gt; most mainstream overlay network implementations (Cisco Nexus 1000V,
    VMware vShield, Microsoft Hyper-V)<br /><br />You meant &quot;vSwitch&quot;, not
    &quot;vShield&quot;, right? ;)'

    html: Flooding is done through IP multicast (VXLAN), through head-end replication
      (unicast VXLAN, NVP) or through service nodes (NVP). Hyper-V doesn&#39;t need
      flooding because it handles ARP locally.

  html: 'Does flooding occur on the entire Ethernet segment? Since each VTEP knows
    the guest VMs connected mac address, why don&#39;t the VTEP&#39;s share macs with
    one another? This way flooding is local to the VTEP. '

    html: ARP request is sent to a broadcast (or multicast in case of ND) address,
      so it&#39;s flooded by definition.<br /><br />ARP reply is sent as unicast and
      wouldn&#39;t leave the hypervisor if the two VMs reside on the same VXLAN segment
      - same behavior as traditional Ethernet switches.<br /><br />Gratuitous ARP
      reply (used for shared IP takeover) is sent to broadcast address ==&gt; flooded.

  html: "Ivan, wrt ARP, you state, \u201CIf the destination MAC address doesn\u2019\
    t belong to a local VM, the layer-2 forwarding code sends the layer-2 frame toward\
    \ the physical NIC.\u201D  Are you saying this does not happen if the destination\
    \ MAC belongs to a VM in the same hypervisor?  I may be reading into it too much,\
    \ but I would expect that to happen no matter what (and the local VM just responds\
    \ normally) or are you just implying it when you state, \u201CIf the destination\
    \ MAC address belongs to a VM residing in the same hypervisor, the frame gets\
    \ delivered to the destination VM.\u201D  The frame gets delivered after the ARP\
    \ request and response, no? If not, this can raise some interesting questions\
    \ with shared IPs, etc."

  html: Great to see someone clearly and explicitly stating the Jumbo Frame requirement.
    Thanks.<br /><br />Steven Iveson
