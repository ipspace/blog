I may be reading into it too much, but I would expect that to happen no matter what (and the local VM just responds normally) or are you just implying it when you state, \u201cIf the destination MAC address belongs to a VM residing in the same hypervisor, the frame gets delivered to the destination VM.\u201d  The frame gets delivered after the ARP request and response, no? If not, this can raise some interesting questions with shared IPs, etc.",
