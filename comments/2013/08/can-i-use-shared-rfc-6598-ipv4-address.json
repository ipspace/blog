I will fully admit that I have a pretty significant dislike for NAT and in general tend to be an IPv6 evangelist, but utilizing address space not meant for this private purpose is a long term disaster waiting to happen and sooner or later, it will cause problems.  It may show up as odd routing inconsistencies, debugging nightmarish translation tables or something else equally unpleasant, you&#39;re essentially black holing that address space internally. It may come after you&#39;re long gone, but, again, it will happen.   <br />I was always taught that just because you *can* do something doesn&#39;t mean you *should* do it.    ",
