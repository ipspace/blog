            <div class="comment-content">honestly ipv6 to a network engineer is like Communism to a Marxist. It would come in such a distant future that it would be in a form we can barely picture accurately. Would NAT still be the norm? Will dual stack be the preferred way? Or encapsulation? History shows us that people are not willing to deal with headaches just to appease some Platonic ideal of elegant design. So my money is on NAT444, at least in the US.</div>
