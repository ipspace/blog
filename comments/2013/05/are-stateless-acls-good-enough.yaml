  html: Great post yet again.  Tough to imagine the firewall ever going away.  Is
    Goldman proposing that all of their internet facing servers software will always
    run stronger than a firewall appliance?  What about their WAN/Business only servers?  They
    are also all going to run software that will be prided over what a firewall offers?  That
    seems like a huge risk/undertaking/investment/risk/admin nightmare.

    html: 75 seconds timeout for a half-open connection is an insane ammount of time.
      A decent SYN flood could annihilate the firewall, depleting it&#39;s memory.<br
      />And I still don&#39;t get your idea. If the attacker has access to tcpdump
      on a server, allowing him to gain knowledge of the server&#39;s ISN, why bother
      with spoofing? He&#39;s already rooted the server, he can do anything.<br /><br
      />Even after establishing the TCP session, he won&#39;t be able to see return
      packets by means other than continuous tcpdump updates, and to get them, he
      has to connect to the server from a real address. So why the heck would you
      need spoofing in the first place?

    html: '75 seconds is the amount of time servers tend to wait for SYN/ACK on outbound
      connections they&#39;ve initiated. Firewalls probably drop state significantly
      sooner. I agree about the firewall state table - that&#39;s the crux of the
      argument against stateful firewalls: Don&#39;t use them if you don&#39;t know
      what traffic to expect.<br /><br />The spoofing comment is not a whole-hog attack
      approach, just an interesting tidbit about circumventing ACLs with &#39;established&#39;
      keyword. Because &#39;established&#39; passes traffic with ACK bit set, the
      only thing it drops is the first SYN in the handshake. As long as we have a
      way to lob that single segment over the ACL (like with a telephone and a friend
      running scapy, perhaps?), we can communicate through an ACL where &#39;established&#39;
      would otherwise have blocked us. No need for tcpdump nonsense after the first
      segment.'

    html: Stateful firewalls are almost a &quot;must&quot; anyway. the question is
      choosing the right model.<br /><br />The problem is getting the first SYN through.
      I&#39;ve honestly no idea how to do that. Spoof from behind the stateless firewall?
      Once again, if you can do that, you probably don&#39;t need to penetrate the
      firewall.

    html: 'I can&#39;t get on board with the &quot;stateful firewalls are a must&quot;
      line of thinking if we&#39;re talking about putting them in front of a server
      farm.<br /><br />Traditional stateful firewalls are going to be susceptible
      to DoS attack by exhausting their state tables.<br /><br />Batshit-crazy TCP-proxy
      firewalls are resistant to this particular DoS attack, but have other problems
      relating to the MiTM attack they perform on every incoming connection.<br /><br
      />There&#39;s a great NANOG thread from January 2010: &quot;I don&#39;t need
      no stinking firewall!&quot;<br /><br />It explains well why stateful firewalls
      shouldn&#39;t frontend a server farm.<br /><br />Yes, the first SYN is the problem.
      But it doesn&#39;t need to go *through*. That&#39;s what makes it interesting.
      Whether or not an attacker has this need is not for us to say. Maybe it&#39;s
      for data exfiltration? Maybe it&#39;s post-compromise lateral movement? I just
      mention it to illustrate that &quot;established&quot; might not be as robust
      as folks assume.'

  html: There are fun workarounds for the established keyword. So long as you&#39;ve
    got some way to communicate to a conspirator, he can spoof the first packet in
    the flow, allowing the rest to work correctly.<br /><br />We&#39;re a webserver
    in this scenario, right? We&#39;d just need to feed tcpdump into a web-accessible
    file, and have our partner system scrape the log for our SYN packets that would
    have been dropped.<br /><br />SYN/ACK reply traffic (initiated by the partner
    spoofing our address) passes the established test, allowing 3-way handshake to
    complete. TCP setup timeout is usually 75 seconds, I think. Plenty of time to
    pull off this attack.

  html: If you have linux, you can put stateless rules on your server. It is very
    robust, but a bit touchy to setup properly.<br /><br />However, people tend to
    forget about spoofed datagrams.<br />We should put more simple anti-spoofed ACLs
    on every gateway.<br /><br />
