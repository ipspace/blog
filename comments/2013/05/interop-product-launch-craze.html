            <div class="comment-content">Assuming a conversion efficiency of 86% for the 7500E Switch Mode power supplies and a fully populated chassis with 1152 - 10G ports, the current draw should max at 48.7A @ 110VAC or 25A@220VAC, not including start-up surge or the load from supervisory and option cards. This is 18282+ BTU, or 1.56 Ton of cooling so no hiding this bad boy in a little closet. Given that it takes more than 1W of power to cool 1W of heat (otherwise perpetual motion would be a reality) the total power consumption to operate one 7500E would be greater than 50A@220VAC. Perhaps Not so cool (pun intended). But Ferarris run warm don&#39;t they.<br />Unless I am way out to lunch here</div>

            <div class="comment-content">hi Anonymous,<br />The system has 4 x 2900W PSUs (each are 80+ &quot;gold &quot;standard and operate typically at 92% efficiency) and runs at under 4W/10G port typical power.<br />The system can operate grid redundant, i.e. a fully loaded chassis can run on 2 x PSUs.<br />Its around ~15800 BTUs with typical power draw of &lt;5KW for a fully loaded chassis, or 2 x 220V 16A feeds.<br /><br />Bear in mind this is front-back cooling (not side to side) so it is forseeable in hot-isle/cold-isle you&#39;d have no problem cooling it.<br />(we have many customers with upwards of 20KW of equipment/rack (servers/storage) and this fits nicely in their environment.)<br /><br />Perhaps best to compare apples/apples:<br />  Cisco N6004: &quot;typical&quot; power 2800W / maximum 3300W for up to 96x40G, or ~29.1W/40G port &#39;typical&#39; and 34.375W/40G port &#39;maximum&#39;.<br />  Arista 7508E scales to 3x that number (288x40G ports) at a power number that is less than half that on a per port basis.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Thank you Lincoln Dale for the Clarification. Keep in mind I was never inferring that some other vendor is providing an equivalent product that consumes less power.</div>
