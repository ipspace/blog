    html: 'I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a shipping OVS running in Hyper-V (at least
      I haven&#39;t found anything on their web site, which is the minimum requirement
      I&#39;d consider something &quot;shipping&quot;).<br /><br />You might want
      to have the same configuration interface/API and the same overlay networking
      model across multiple hypervisors, in which case a vSwitch running on multiple
      platforms (ex: Nexus 1000V) comes handy.'

    html: Ivan, I spoke with Alessandro Pilotti (CloudBase Solutions) two days ago
      at OpenStack CEE Day in Budapest. He said they will announce OVS Hyper-V integration.
      Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have any details, as I attended different track and
      didn&#39;t hear the actual talk, but I guess all the info should be out in the
      next few days?

    html: Thanks for the feedback. Based on their web site, they already have Hyper-V
      Quantum plugin which works together with OVS in VLAN mode. If they have more
      than that, do tell him that I&#39;m just an email away ;)<br /><br />Best,<br
      />Ivan

  html: 'Ivan - it&#39;s my understanding that Open vSwitch can also run in Hyper-V.
    Is the proliferation of vSwitches a good thing for users? It can be a useful control
    point (NEC and HP using for SDN purposes), but it can also be a lock-in. <br />Thanks,<br

    html: The vSwitch is a powerful control point and the barrier to entry is significant.
      Rather than proliferating virtual switches, I think users are given more choice
      if each platform&#39;s virtual switch uses an extension model like Microsoft&#39;s.
      Extensibility lowers the barrier to entry, making it easy to develop new security,
      monitoring and forwarding capabilities and giving users the ability to mix and
      match modules in a way that make sense in their environment.<br /><br />For
      example, InMon developed a free traffic monitoring extension implementing the
      sFlow standard on the Hyper-V extensible vSwitch and our module can be combined
      with the default switching module, or with Cisco or NEC forwarding modules.
      The following article describes our experiences with the Hyper-V extensible
      vSwitch:<br /><br /><a href="http://blog.sflow.com/2011/09/microsoft-hyper-v.html"
      rel="nofollow">Microsoft Hyper-V</a><br /><br />One of the reasons Apache has
      been so successful is the rich ecosystem of modules that has developed around
      it. It would be great to see vSwitches develop into similarly open platforms.

  html: I used to think of it as lock in, but as you said Stu, it&#39;s a control
    point.  Why should the virtual switch be controlled by 2 or 3 vendors/products
    when the physical network has many more than that?  <br /><br />I think we&#39;ll
    see more vswitches emerge in some form or another (open source extensions or commercial
    products).<br /><br />So, is the proliferation of vswitches a good thing for users?  Not
    sure yet, but choice is good, so that in it of itself is usually a positive thing...for
    the user :)<br /><br />-Jason<br />

  html: Microsoft needs third party extension while VMware often doesn&#39;t. Even
    after the release of the 1000v, many VMware implementations bypassed it. The native
    capabilities are &quot;good enough&quot;.

    html: Let me rephrase - you decided to measure the forwarding path that is never
      used in real life and thus probably not optimized. The measurements of forwarding
      performance between physical NICs are irrelevant to how these products are used.<br
      /><br />The validity of such results is questionable, their usefulness is not.

  html: 'First of all, thank you for great post. <br />Anyway I have a question about
    Hyper-V and ESXi standard switch. Currently I&#39;m doing a performance evaluation
    of different vSwitches as a part of my research work. My intention is to evaluate
    perormance of bare vSwitches by using simple bridging of network traffic over
    physical NICs (this way I can use external testing equipment). However, this is
    possible for OpenvSwitch, but by default bridging between pNICs is disabled in
    Hyper-V and ESXi due to the lack of STP support (so traffic loops can not occur).
    However, if I install PF1000, pNICS bridging can be enabled in Hyper-V, unlike
    in ESXi (even if I use Cisco 1000V). <br />My question is, if you happen to know
    the answer: Is there any way to disable this loop prevention in standard ESXi
    vSwitch or in standard Hyper-V (maybe some debug or serivce mode exists, where
    this woud be possible)?'
