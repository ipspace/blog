    html: Ah, those were the days. There were quite a few reasons those materials
      turned out as they did, including the fact that we created them based on real-life
      teaching experience of several instructors going back almost a decade.

  html: The BGP 1.0 and MPLS course-ware you wrote is some of the best pieces of course-ware
    out there.  I would love to see you do more work with Learning@Cisco

    html: RD-per-VRF solves the &quot;load balancing beyond RR&quot; problem (which
      is also solved with AddPath).<br /><br />In this scenario it won&#39;t help
      - the PE router with the backup link will import IBGP VPNv4 route with a different
      RD into its BGP table (based on RT settings), select it as the best, and thus
      stop advertising its VRF EBGP route to IBGP peers.

    html: Thanks for correcting me. I have learned a ton from your posts and mpls
      books. The fail over solution you have outlined in this post is my go to solution
      /w communities. Eager to start labbing this and improving my offering.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Using different RD per vrf per pe would also provide the
    same benefits?

    html: BGP Multipath does not work when the two external BGP routes are not (nearly)
      identical, which they shouldn&#39;t be in primary/backup scenarios.

  html: Hi Ivan!<br /><br />Thanks for the great explanation.<br /><br />Would you
    please also give your advise on how the described feature inter-operates/integrates
    with BGP Multipath.<br /><br />My view is that when BGP Multipath is enabled in
    load-balancing scenario, one doesn&#39;t need any additional tweaks like &quot;BGP
    Best external&quot;, could you please share your expert view on that?<br />
