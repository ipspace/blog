            <div class="comment-content">But then you&#39;d have 20 individual systems to manage, add licenses to for additional features, updates etc.<br /><br />How would you do something like a Fortigate 3600c using software/VM&#39;s? 60Gb Firewalling throughput in 3RU of space.<br /><br />Hardware probably still has a place in the middle of a network but at the edges where bandwidth is much lower then software can be fine.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">There was a time when it was more cost efficient to do things like SSL off-load in a purpose built appliance like F5. E.g. the amount of Server hardware you needed cost more (capes, rackspace, power, cooling) than the appliance.<br /><br />With Moore&#39;s Law, coupled with the newer efficiencies of Server virtualisation, that is no longer the case. There is a good reason that F5 bought LineRate. Software is eating hardware because it&#39;s cheaper &amp; better &amp; more agile.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan,<br /><br />Thanks for mentioning the power :)<br /><br />I also wanted to point out a few things:<br /><br />1. There are solutions that can be deployed with less than 4 cores, but def a good comparison for NGFWs.  If NGFWs aren&#39;t needed in the DC, other solutions that require fewer resources can be used.<br />2.  There are benefits of having it in software for snapshots, rollbacks, templats, etc.<br />3. How often is 20G REALLY NEEDED day 1?  Scale out designs, pay as you grow, rapid deployment are also benefits of the software/NFV model.  Likely, an environment will never even hit the capacity of the HW device - it&#39;s deployed &quot;just in case&quot; and for a 3-5 year life cycle.<br />4. Casado often says (as I do now) N simple devices vs. 1 complex device.  Definitely another advantage here.<br /><br />You made the point that pricing is lower in the example, but there are so many other benefits to point out b/c some ppl may dwell on the negatives :)  <br /><br />-Jason<br /><br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">I don&#39;t know how palo alto does their throughput calculations, but note that a Fortigate 3600C is 60Gbps of pure firewall throughput (although managing that across the 3xNP4&#39;s inside can be complex) but only 14Gbps of IPS throughput.<br />If you don&#39;t need the hardware accelerated IPS, buying Fortigate 800C&#39;s is the best bang for your buck - its the same chip as the 3600C (NP4 with 2x10G) but only one per chassis, but at 1/6th the cost.  If the 3600C is anything like the 3140B I&#39;ve used, there is not a load balancing fabric in front of those 3 chips, but instead the 12x10G on the front are split evenly (4 each) across those NP4 processors.<br /><br />I&#39;m still a big fan of them, there are just a number of caveats with Fortinet that you don&#39;t realize until you try and actually implement it.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ah, they use NP4. Cool ;) Looked at them once, they&#39;re really impressive.<br /><br />When you talk of &quot;pure firewall throughput&quot;, does that include full TCP session validation (including fragment reassembly if needed)?<br /><br />Thanks!

            <div class="comment-content">I assume it is based on the EzChip hardware, but I think they &quot;renumber&quot; them, so what Fortinet calls a NP2 is really an EzChip NA-0 (or perhaps someone else&#39;s) and what Fortinet calls an NP4 is really an EzChip NP-2.<br /><br />As far as TCP validation, I believe that is included, but I don&#39;t know if it can do reassembly in hardware.  The general flow is that all new sessions go through the x86 CPU (which varies from an 4-core i5 in the 800C to an 8-core Xeon in the 3600C) which profiles the session and then hands it off to the NP4 for flow through the system.  Adding in AV or IPS slows that down, although it looks like Palo Alto is not including IPS in their throughput numbers either.  Various models have other processors (CP8 for AV, SP2 for IPS) that can help accelerate those as well.</div>
