    html: 'If you managed to automate everything and use a central orchestration tool
      as the sole VLAN/IP/VRF/FW/LB provisioning mechanism, then it just might work.<br
      /><br />In any other case, you&#39;ll pay hefty Murphy&#39;s tax.<br /><br />Also,
      don&#39;t forget the usual three steps to disaster recovery planning: 1. Disaster,
      2. Recovery, 3. Plan ;D'

  html: Another option would be to configure a copy of the network connectivity +
    services (VLANs, IP ranges, VRFs, firewall instances/contexts, load balancer instances/contexts)
    at the DR site, and have it isolated at the point where it would connect to the
    outside. All changes/updates to the primary configuration would need to be applied
    to the DR copy at the time of the primary change.<br /><br />That way all you
    need in case of a DR event is to swing the external connectivity.

  html: You are describing DR of the Cloud. Replicated resource cluster LUNs + protected
    (with Site Recovery Manager) management components that contain the configurations
    including virtual networks and network services. On VMware website there are two
    whitepapers how to achieve this with vCloud Director.

  html: We actually do this today and swing all datacenter operations annually to
    verify operation. During the swing, customers utilize and certify that all services
    meet requirements. Failover takes about 4 hours (darn databases).<br /><br />We
    have virtualized most of the solution (network and DB outstanding). As continue
    to virtualize, the support requirement and swing times continue to decline. <br
