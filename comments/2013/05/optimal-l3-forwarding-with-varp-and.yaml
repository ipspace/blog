    html: Arista&#39;s VARP works with both IPv4 and IPv6.<br />(support was added
      in EOS 4.11.3 if you wanted to look back to where it appeared).<br /><br />IPv6
      is most definitely not a 2nd class citizen on Arista.

  html: does arista have something similar for ipv6 or is the trend for 2013 still
    to ignore the elephant in the room?

    html: Cisco GLBP uses multiple mac-addresses for multiple gateways to &#39;share&#39;
      traffic.  It requires a heartbeat protocol and messages between active/standby
      to handle failures.<br /><br />Arista VARP uses a single common mac address
      across all devices (more than 2 are supported) and in fact you can run it at
      different places in your network (e.g. both leaf and spine). Since every device
      is &#39;active&#39; there is no need for any protocol and thus there is also
      no failover time period.

  html: Arista&#39;s VARP sounds like GLBP, Am I wrong with this assumption?

    html: 'Nico,<br />Cisco&#39;s alternative behavior of run the standby as active
      for HSRP, VRRP and GLBP in vPC isn&#39;t really &#39;similar&#39;. You still
      have a protocol, you still have a maximum of 2-way active and you still have
      scale limitations imposed by the protocol scaling (e.g. see Cisco&#39;s published
      &quot;maximum system scale&quot; numbers for # of FHRP instances.<br /><br />FabricPath
      doesn&#39;t solve this problem (and nor does FabricPath address the inherent
      scale issues either with mac-table size on F1/F2 modules on N7K).<br /><br />Anycast
      FHRP would be a good thing but then again I think I was talking about that 4
      years ago, its still not there?'

  html: Cisco has something similar in NX-OS. The behavior of HSRP when used together
    with vPC is changed from the typical HSRP implementation that we are familiar
    with in Cisco IOS.<br /><br />In NX-OS vPC and HSRP implementation, both the active
    and standby HSRP gateways actively forward packets (HSRP virtual MAC of vPC switches
    are programmed with the G flag on both systems).<br /><br />This is still limited
    to a vpC pair of N7k or N5k but Anycast FHRP on Fabricpath should pop up in the
    next months..

  html: "Ivan,<br />A small comment: you mention &quot;Things might get nasty if you\

    html: I find the best way to deal with this is to take the MAC address from one
      of the router interfaces in the VARP group, and turn it into a locally administered
      mac address.  Take the second-least-significant bit in the most significant
      byte and change it from 0 to 1.  Or just do it in your head, I think Arista
      only has one OUI, 00-1c-73, the local version would be 02-1c-73.  Then using
      the same last 3 bytes from one of the vendor assigned MAC addresses for a router
      interface in that vlan, you would end up with a MAC that should be unique in
      your LAN.

  html: we use Arista with VARP. works amazingly well and we love it.  As a note though,
    it is absolutely critical that the mac-address you put in is unique.  In a bit
    of a novice move we put the same mac-address on multiple pairs of switches. That
    works fine until you need to bridge a vlan through one pair to the other pair
    where the SVI is.  The first switch that sees the frame sees that it is the mac-address
    and tries to route it, quite unsuccessfully.<br /><br />makes 100% sense and was
    a silly thing to do, but easy mistake for a VARP rookie...

  html: The Plexxi solution is pretty much the same (virtual IP and MAC address shared
    by all switches), but configuration simplicity is achieved by not having the user
    configure this on each switch. The virtual IP address is configured per VLAN only,
    our controller will ensure all appropriate switches will be configured properly.
    And the shared MAC address is the same for all VLANs.

  html: "Sorry for the years late thread reply here; (Ivan/Dale) is there any way\
    \ to get comment on this remark? <br /><br />&quot;The first switch that is hit\

    \ MAC address (I\u2019m not sure about the details \u2013 it might well be that\

  html: Hi nsxtech.net,<br />The answer will obviously be implementation-dependent,
    but the short answer is that it could be any number of things and still work just
    fine.<br /><br />What is required for ARP to work is that a device answers the
    ARP request.  That &#39;reply&#39; could eithe be a broadcast response (sort of
    like what GARP does) or unicast. If its unicast, only the destination receives
    it.<br /><br />The &quot;implementation dependent&quot; piece depends on what
    the initial &#39;hop&#39; switch does, its a broadcast ARP request, does it eat
    that broadcast and respond on its own, or does it forward the broadcast and potentially
    get multiple answers back from many distributed [independent] gateways.<br />Either
    is possible, via configuration.<br />There may be merits in localizing ARP response
    but nothing bad happens if there are duplicate responses.<br />
