          "html": "The vSwitch is a powerful control point and the barrier to entry is significant. Rather than proliferating virtual switches, I think users are given more choice if each platform&#39;s virtual switch uses an extension model like Microsoft&#39;s. Extensibility lowers the barrier to entry, making it easy to develop new security, monitoring and forwarding capabilities and giving users the ability to mix and match modules in a way that make sense in their environment.<br /><br />For example, InMon developed a free traffic monitoring extension implementing the sFlow standard on the Hyper-V extensible vSwitch and our module can be combined with the default switching module, or with Cisco or NEC forwarding modules. The following article describes our experiences with the Hyper-V extensible vSwitch:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://blog.sflow.com/2011/09/microsoft-hyper-v.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft Hyper-V</a><br /><br />One of the reasons Apache has been so successful is the rich ecosystem of modules that has developed around it. It would be great to see vSwitches develop into similarly open platforms.",

Why should the virtual switch be controlled by 2 or 3 vendors/products when the physical network has many more than that?  <br /><br />I think we&#39;ll see more vswitches emerge in some form or another (open source extensions or commercial products).<br /><br />So, is the proliferation of vswitches a good thing for users?  Not sure yet, but choice is good, so that in it of itself is usually a positive thing...for the user :)<br /><br />-Jason<br />",

      "html": "First of all, thank you for great post. <br />Anyway I have a question about Hyper-V and ESXi standard switch. Currently I&#39;m doing a performance evaluation of different vSwitches as a part of my research work. My intention is to evaluate perormance of bare vSwitches by using simple bridging of network traffic over physical NICs (this way I can use external testing equipment). However, this is possible for OpenvSwitch, but by default bridging between pNICs is disabled in Hyper-V and ESXi due to the lack of STP support (so traffic loops can not occur). However, if I install PF1000, pNICS bridging can be enabled in Hyper-V, unlike in ESXi (even if I use Cisco 1000V). <br />My question is, if you happen to know the answer: Is there any way to disable this loop prevention in standard ESXi vSwitch or in standard Hyper-V (maybe some debug or serivce mode exists, where this woud be possible)?",
