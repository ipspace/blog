  html: One possible set of circumstances when &quot;cloudbursting&quot; may be feasible
    is when you also use your cloud provider as your backup/archive for your data
    stash. In that case most if not all of your data is available close at hand for
    the workloads you spin in the cloud.

  html: Ivan, thank you for this, location does indeed matter. We all know it and
    this is a nice analogy to articulate the relationship between application and
    data, application and application, and data and data. The relationships exist
    and as such (virtual) distance will greatly impact behavior.
