            <div class="comment-content">Ivan - it&#39;s my understanding that Open vSwitch can also run in Hyper-V. Is the proliferation of vSwitches a good thing for users? It can be a useful control point (NEC and HP using for SDN purposes), but it can also be a lock-in. <br />Thanks,<br />Stu Miniman<br />Wikibon.org<br />Twitter: @stu</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a shipping OVS running in Hyper-V (at least I haven&#39;t found anything on their web site, which is the minimum requirement I&#39;d consider something &quot;shipping&quot;).<br /><br />You might want to have the same configuration interface/API and the same overlay networking model across multiple hypervisors, in which case a vSwitch running on multiple platforms (ex: Nexus 1000V) comes handy.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan, I spoke with Alessandro Pilotti (CloudBase Solutions) two days ago at OpenStack CEE Day in Budapest. He said they will announce OVS Hyper-V integration. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have any details, as I attended different track and didn&#39;t hear the actual talk, but I guess all the info should be out in the next few days?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Thanks for the feedback. Based on their web site, they already have Hyper-V Quantum plugin which works together with OVS in VLAN mode. If they have more than that, do tell him that I&#39;m just an email away ;)<br /><br />Best,<br />Ivan</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I used to think of it as lock in, but as you said Stu, it&#39;s a control point.  Why should the virtual switch be controlled by 2 or 3 vendors/products when the physical network has many more than that?  <br /><br />I think we&#39;ll see more vswitches emerge in some form or another (open source extensions or commercial products).<br /><br />So, is the proliferation of vswitches a good thing for users?  Not sure yet, but choice is good, so that in it of itself is usually a positive thing...for the user :)<br /><br />-Jason<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">The vSwitch is a powerful control point and the barrier to entry is significant. Rather than proliferating virtual switches, I think users are given more choice if each platform&#39;s virtual switch uses an extension model like Microsoft&#39;s. Extensibility lowers the barrier to entry, making it easy to develop new security, monitoring and forwarding capabilities and giving users the ability to mix and match modules in a way that make sense in their environment.<br /><br />For example, InMon developed a free traffic monitoring extension implementing the sFlow standard on the Hyper-V extensible vSwitch and our module can be combined with the default switching module, or with Cisco or NEC forwarding modules. The following article describes our experiences with the Hyper-V extensible vSwitch:<br /><br /><a href="http://blog.sflow.com/2011/09/microsoft-hyper-v.html" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Hyper-V</a><br /><br />One of the reasons Apache has been so successful is the rich ecosystem of modules that has developed around it. It would be great to see vSwitches develop into similarly open platforms.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">First of all, thank you for great post. <br />Anyway I have a question about Hyper-V and ESXi standard switch. Currently I&#39;m doing a performance evaluation of different vSwitches as a part of my research work. My intention is to evaluate perormance of bare vSwitches by using simple bridging of network traffic over physical NICs (this way I can use external testing equipment). However, this is possible for OpenvSwitch, but by default bridging between pNICs is disabled in Hyper-V and ESXi due to the lack of STP support (so traffic loops can not occur). However, if I install PF1000, pNICS bridging can be enabled in Hyper-V, unlike in ESXi (even if I use Cisco 1000V). <br />My question is, if you happen to know the answer: Is there any way to disable this loop prevention in standard ESXi vSwitch or in standard Hyper-V (maybe some debug or serivce mode exists, where this woud be possible)?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Let me rephrase - you decided to measure the forwarding path that is never used in real life and thus probably not optimized. The measurements of forwarding performance between physical NICs are irrelevant to how these products are used.<br /><br />The validity of such results is questionable, their usefulness is not.</div>
