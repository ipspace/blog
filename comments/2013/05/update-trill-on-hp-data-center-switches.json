We also support TRILL on the 11900 and 12900 series that we launched at Interop. We had a TRILL demo running in the booth between 6 x 5900 and 2 x 11900&#39;s.

Something just doesn&#39;t add up.<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback!<br />Ivan",

For some reason I had read that you could not find anything about trill in the 5900 2207 release notes, so was trying to be helpfull, but you clearly stated that it is only on the 5900. <br /><br />Time for coffee !<br />Best regards,Peter",

How about TRILL (or SPB) on Cisco 3850 and 3650 and 4500 (their current lineup.)  How about the HP 5400zl2?  All these switches were designed and shipped *after* TRILL came out.<br /><br />I just came off of some Cisco SE training for company certification (terribly stupid curriculum) and they are still talking about STP.  It blocks a port to stop loops!  What a feature!  Cool.<br /><br />Ughhh.  Die STP, die.  Just die already.<br />",
