It requires a heartbeat protocol and messages between active/standby to handle failures.<br /><br />Arista VARP uses a single common mac address across all devices (more than 2 are supported) and in fact you can run it at different places in your network (e.g. both leaf and spine). Since every device is &#39;active&#39; there is no need for any protocol and thus there is also no failover time period.",

All that would happen is that you&#39;d have more traffic flowing towards wherever the actual virtual-mac-address is that the host last heard a gratitous ARP from.  And that may oscillate.<br />I think (but haven&#39;t checked) that VARP even knows about that oscillation and will point it out - its a neat aspect of gratuitous arps being broadcast, every switch will &#39;see&#39; them.",

Take the second-least-significant bit in the most significant byte and change it from 0 to 1.  Or just do it in your head, I think Arista only has one OUI, 00-1c-73, the local version would be 02-1c-73.  Then using the same last 3 bytes from one of the vendor assigned MAC addresses for a router interface in that vlan, you would end up with a MAC that should be unique in your LAN.",

In a bit of a novice move we put the same mac-address on multiple pairs of switches. That works fine until you need to bridge a vlan through one pair to the other pair where the SVI is.  The first switch that sees the frame sees that it is the mac-address and tries to route it, quite unsuccessfully.<br /><br />makes 100% sense and was a silly thing to do, but easy mistake for a VARP rookie...",

      "html": "Hi nsxtech.net,<br />The answer will obviously be implementation-dependent, but the short answer is that it could be any number of things and still work just fine.<br /><br />What is required for ARP to work is that a device answers the ARP request.  That &#39;reply&#39; could eithe be a broadcast response (sort of like what GARP does) or unicast. If its unicast, only the destination receives it.<br /><br />The &quot;implementation dependent&quot; piece depends on what the initial &#39;hop&#39; switch does, its a broadcast ARP request, does it eat that broadcast and respond on its own, or does it forward the broadcast and potentially get multiple answers back from many distributed [independent] gateways.<br />Either is possible, via configuration.<br />There may be merits in localizing ARP response but nothing bad happens if there are duplicate responses.<br />",
