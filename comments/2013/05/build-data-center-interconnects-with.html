            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I&#39;m taking this initiative of yours with a big grain of salt. I have participated in a few of your webinars and I think they&#39;re awesome... (in fact I&#39;m looking forward to the DC/IPv6 live webinar next week). I respect your points of view and I consider you to be very knowledgable and a sort of authority in the world of networking bloggers ;)<br /><br />My problem with this specific webinar is that I have a lot of reservations when it comes to Enterasys technology, and I&#39;m not alone. I have 1 year of hands-on experience with Enterasys switches (the B5 and C5 line). I&#39;ve tried to integrate them into an existing corporate network doing stuff that I&#39;ve done in the past with Cisco, Brocade, Dell, IBM/Nortel and even H3C. You wouldn&#39;t believe how many horror stories I (and the other netadmins in the team) have accumulated over this period of time. <br /><br />I see no point in trashing a vendor out in the open just on the basis of personal experience, so I&#39;ll leave it at that. If you&#39;re interested in hearing more about these horror stories, let me know and I&#39;ll shoot you an email.<br /><br />I&#39;d like to think their OneFabric line of products is more robust than the C5/B5 line... but if I was given the choice, I&#39;d stay away from their products altogether.<br /><br />Anyway... rant is over. Just my $0.02!<br /><br />Cheers!<br />AF<br /><br />Disclaimer: I work for a VAR that mostly resells network gear from Cisco and Brocade with some Nortel/IBM stuff too. The Enterasys products are used by one of our customers and they didn&#39;t buy these switches from us... in fact they only buy professional services from our company as they get their gear elsewhere. I&#39;m Cisco and Brocade certified and some people say I&#39;m a Cisco fanboy, although I disagree with that (maybe I&#39;m living in denial?).</div>
