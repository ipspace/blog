            <div class="comment-content">As a vendor, control plane overload has long been a painful source of many outages and odd behavior, and in many cases very hard to debug and fix. While many newer generation switch ASICs have mechanisms to control the flow of traffic to the (almost always underpowered) CPU, little consistency exists in the control and definition of that limiting functionality.<br /><br />OpenFlow has the potential to add to the control plane work a switch has to perform. We really should use larger CPUs in our switches (always a cost/margin choice for a vendor) and I fully agree with you that a consistent mechanism to control control plane traffic is a must. OpenFlow or otherwise.<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">Great post. Nice to see NEC thinking about solving these real problems. Also nice to here Marten echo the sentiment on the limitations of the nickel and dime field processors for FMPS.<br /><br />Ordered lists of TCAM requiring table re-writes/re-ordering depending on the spacing from the agent is comical to watch. L2 reactive forwarding as much as it pains me to think of it, is probably one of the few options. NPUs are putting up some pretty good numbers but I will believe it when I see it.<br /><br />Ive been trying to find time to proof a hashtable capturing high volume pps into the CP to trigger something. I dunno tho, Ops at the day job finds BUM traffic only when a problem has gone on long enough to trigger trouble and the pcap uncovers a crippling unicast flooding result. Maybe client agents are the right idea lol :0?<br /><br />Cheers, great videos with NEC.<br />-Brent</div>
