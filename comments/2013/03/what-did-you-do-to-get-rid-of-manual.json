How many IT guys can say that they understand fully what SDN is all about? <br /><br />The image which everybody sees is that with SDN (for example) or other kind of automatic handling of network resources, is that we get rid of those old dinosaurs called network engineers. <br /><br />Next step, everybody wants automatic deployment of everything, but when some people encounter a problem (ex. network) they rush back to the dinosaurs for help, pointing again that network is an issue. The fact that everybody wants control over network resources without understanding the technical background, well, that&#39;s not an issue.<br /><br />I see SDN as an innovative technology, but I don&#39;t see it as the magic pill which will replace knowledge and experience. <br /><br />I don&#39;t want to offend anybody, but I meet people working with VMware products which had no idea how the product works actually.<br />It&#39;s not VMware&#39;s fault, don&#39;t get me wrong.<br /> <br />He was explaining a VM machine like you click here and then click there...ok, ok but what&#39;s going on in the background, how is the vSwitch communicate with physical network for example? Silence.<br /><br />This is the direction in which we want to go? Click here and there? I understand that we can do now more with less brain usage than 20 years ago, but this is only because there are &quot;dinosaurs&quot; which consider reading, learning and using brain for more than day to day activities. <br /><br />Don&#39;t worry, if things are going on this path and nobody understand, by everybody uses terms like SDN to hide real problems, in another 20 years we can click here and click there to eliminate the last IT &quot;dinosaurs&quot;.",

Network team handles the transport layer while the server guys can transport any number of VLANs over it.<br /><br />This doesn&#39;t (of course) prevent a server guy from borking a vswitch and complaining to the network guys. THAT&#39;S where SDN comes in to play. SDN should allow the network to be provisioned dynamically and automagically at that lower level from the Ethernet transport infrastructure. Ideally, SDN would allow a client to send a tagged frame (with some form of handshake I would presume) and the SDN faeries provision the access ports and ensure any trunk ports which connect to a switch with the same VLAN in use are configured to allow it.<br /><br />Of course both of those still rely on some form of STP which is a waste.

One more reason for me to write the damned blog post. :) Anyway, short summary: physical network should continue to be configured/managed by the networking team, but instead of VLANs that provide connectivity to VMs, they should provide &quot;transport&quot; connectivity to vSwitches (running in hosts and ToRs) for their virtualised networking overlays.<br /><br />Then server/virt team would configure/reconfigure vSwitches via SDN/whatever, while the transport network stays stable and secure. Everybody wins - networking team doesn&#39;t have to deal with high volumes of moves/adds/changes; no weird-ass protocols to track VMs; and server guys can do whatever they want without endangering the whole shabang.<br />",

Your management networks, vmotion networks, etc. will take up a handful of VLANs.  Then we allocate a large number of VLANs for customer networks and allow those on the trunks to the hosts where those customers could reside (for example, we may allocate VLANs 2000 through 2999 as tenant networks).  At that point, you then have to provision your VLANs on your vNICs but you can write an easy script to take care of that.<br /><br />You end up having to manage VLANs and when you consider that you might one day have a need for VLANs to span multiple data centers, you need to reserve a set of VLANs for that purpose.  I know how adamant you are against that and frankly, I agree that there are very few needs for it.<br /><br />One other thing you have to watch out for in these environments is your VLAN port counts (or STP logical interfaces in Cisco speak).  A cloud provider can quickly run up on that number long before they run up on the supported VLAN limit.  Every time you add a VLAN to a VNIC, it creates a new STP logical interface and that is a limited resource on the N5Ks, etc...<br /><br />Layer 2 sucks.",

      "html": "The big challenge with VLAN provisioning for many folks IMO has been the risks of managing VLANs in the core of an STP-based network.  Configuring access ports and access trunks is comparatively very low risk.<br /><br />In the last few years, we&#39;ve seen new [non-STP] bridging technologies that don&#39;t require VLAN provisioning on core-facing links -- VXLAN, QFabric, FabricPath, SPB, etc.  These are all overlay based bridging technologies.  With these solutions, the major reason for slow VLAN deployments is done away with.  What remains is the lack of a standards-based solutions for the network to autonomically attach access ports to VLANs.  VDP as a solution seems to have gone nowhere because of bloat possibly.   However, we can expect to see an &quot;MVRP UNI&quot; arrive soon enough that will be coupled with overlay-based (ex: VXLAN) core bridging networks.<br /><br />In the MVRP UNI approach, a hypervisor will send VLAN declaration to a TOR when a VM requiring it shows up.  The TOR attaches the port/channel to the required VLAN, and the rest is handled by the overlay protocol.  The TOR never propogates or declares a VLAN to it&#39;s neighbors (including hypervisors).  This is an unconventional use of MVRP, but works fine for the purpose of autonomic VLAN configuration and satisfies the needs of the average enterprise.  Linux will have MVRP support (http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/244153).  Now we just need to get Openstack support and the rest will follow.<br /><br />This isn&#39;t the glorious approach, but for most companies good-enough will do for now, and hopefully some measure of sanity restored.  There are a number of benefits for the average enterprise which I&#39;ll leave for another day.",

It is about a level of trust and at times to &quot;code&quot; that trust into the tool to guarantee 100% will take too long to do thus you might as well as do it manually and get it done quicker. Who do you trust the chance of the tool messing up or that fat finger?",

Just to make things worse, large network vendors have configuration tools that launch changes without so much as a single confirmation box or &quot;Are you sure?&quot; warning. Almost as though the developers have never heard of the concepts of change management. These &quot;tools&quot; practically guarantee a bad outcome. Fear is the appropriate emotion when faced with these options.",
