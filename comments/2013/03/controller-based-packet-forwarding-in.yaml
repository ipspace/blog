    html: Of course it depends - on the functionality the controller vendor wants
      to implement, on the controller implementation (some open-source controllers
      are notoriously simplistic) and the capabilities of the physical switch (vanilla
      OpenFlow lacks too many features).<br /><br />CoPP has to be implemented in
      linecards (oops, OpenFlow switches). NEC has something similar to CoPP (unicast
      flooding limit), but that functionality is not part of OpenFlow, so they had
      to implement a proprietary extension that only works on their switches.

  html: Ian,<br /><br />Great post as always.  Question, is the &quot;proactive&quot;
    and &quot;reactive&quot; options open to vendor implementations?  We have all
    seen the negative affects punting traffic has, so the OF controller would have
    to have some sort of control-plane policing (CoPP) implemented in the case of
    reactive-mode, or one, or a network anomoly could easily DDoS the controller.

  html: I think DHT-based flow routing makes more sense than dest-ip (gateway) based
    routing on an openflow network.
