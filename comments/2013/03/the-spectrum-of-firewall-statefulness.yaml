  html: Hi,<br /><br />Regarding any stateful firewall how does it keep track of UDP
    sessions?<br />Except session timeout is there any other security mechanism dealing
    with UDP traffic on stateful firewalls?

    html: At least Cisco ASA CX seems to be somewhere close to the WAF end of the
      spectrum - they can do deep application inspection for numerous applications.

  html: 'What about Dell Sonicwall? As far as I managed to test it, it seems to do
    a better job at what is generally known as deep packet inspection. Sadly, I didn&#39;t
    manage to get my hands on an ASA CX just yet to compare. '
