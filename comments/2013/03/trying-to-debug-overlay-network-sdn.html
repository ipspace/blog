            <div class="comment-content">I always learned that a design is finished, not when you can not add anything anymore. No. It is finished when you can not remove anything anymore.<br /><br />When I look at current network technologies, I see an unbelievable huge mess. I understand how it works. And why it has evolved the way it has. But still, it&#39;s a huge mess.<br /><br />Someone should design a whole new network architecture. One that scales. One that has all required features like mobility, multi-homing, automatic addressing, etc. Just layer-2 and layer-3. Just make sure that the thing looks the same to EndSystems, as IPv4 looks today.<br /><br />You could even go one step further.<br />IPv6 is still not deployed. Not really.<br />Why not make some changes to IPv6 ? Small changes on EndSystems. And huge changes to IPv6 on routers. Then we can throw away 90% of the complexity of current systems. Make this new protocol compatible with v4 through a workable NAT-technology. And then there might be a reason to migrate away from v4.<br /><br />One can dream.</div>
