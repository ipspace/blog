            <div class="comment-content">There&#39;s a fourth major reason people announce multiple prefixes, which is piecemeal allocations by the RIR&#39;s, something which is largely not an issue with v6. At $JOB[-1] we had ~20 v4 blocks (after aggregating blocks initially allocated as separate /24&#39;s that happened to be sequential) vs 1 v6.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Pretty much disagree. IPv6 BGP table will be much smaller, as the initial allocation sizes are much bigger and also big operators now uses one or two routing slots in the IPv6 table and hundreds of them in IPv4 routing table. <br /><br />Of course there are sub-smart people aout there, I saw one even deaggregating /48 PI space to small /56 junks and pushing that to a global IPv6 routing table (there was one last week) and also lot&#39;s of other junk is floating around (I can show you the output from my core router, you would be amazed what junk is in the IPv6 table) - but in general, I don&#39;t expect the v6 table to explode. Today there are approx. 43.000 ASNs, and the v6 table should not hit 100k anytime soon - provided that we deal with the idiots that de-aggregate :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Unless you&#39;ve done testing and have shown otherwise, I think your routing entry sizes for the ASR are a little low. Depending on the RP and memory configuration, I&#39;ve seen numbers between 1 million to 29 million for IPv4 (configured as a route reflector with BGP selective download) and 1 million to 7 million for IPv6. To your larger point though, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a big deal in any case. The number of routes in the global BGP table hasn&#39;t changed by an order of magnitude in a long while. When it does change, the hardware guys will just increase the size of TCAM by a few factors.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">There are other considerations too:<br />* what routes will an ISP advertise to its peers? An ISP might carry many ipv4 routes but can summarize the routes allocated to him to its ISP peers. If a large company has PI addresses, many branches, and use multiple ISPs, then there could be many /48 (one per branch) advertised to the ISP peers, unless the branches connect via vpn to the main site. The ISP will not be able to summarize the routes to its peers unless the PIs addresses are allocated carefully (isp based?).<br /><br />* most ISPs will accept and advertise to their peers a /48 route (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_IPv6_support_by_major_transit_providers), and companies might not aggregate their PI routes as much as they could.</div>
