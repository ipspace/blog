For EIRGP, lowest AS number is the tie breaker.<br /><br />&quot;Before Cisco bug ID CSCdw10987 (registered customers only) (integrated in Cisco IOS Software Releases 12.2(07.04)S, 12.2(07.04)T, and later), the last process to make an shortest path first algorithm (SPF) would have won, and the two processes overwrite other routes in the routing table. Now, if a route is installed via one process, it is not overwritten by another OSPF process with the same administrative domain (AD), unless the route is first deleted from the routing table by the process that initially installed the route in the routing table.&quot;",
