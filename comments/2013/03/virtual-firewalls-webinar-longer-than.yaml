    html: Thank you! I&#39;m definitely mentioning the virtual contexts (not individual
      products) and how they differ from truly virtualized firewalls.

  html: What about LSYS on the Juniper SRX ? or Contexts on the ASA ? or were you
    thinking more about things that live in or around the hypervisor ?

    html: Load balancers are mostly implemented as either physical boxes or virtual
      appliances (VMs running on a hypervisor), so they are (from the networking perspective)
      not much different from VM-format firewalls.<br /><br />OTOH, I am planning
      to refresh the DC webinar and will definitely include more on load balancers.<br
      /><br />Thank you!<br />Ivan

  html: Hi,<br /><br />Perhaps not the best fit for this webinar, but maybe something
    about load balancers as well?  Load balancers are often the public facing endpoint
    of an application these days instead of firewalls.. Moving from expensive inflexible
    appliances to scalable virtual machines is an interesting subject.<br />

    html: Amazingly, most of these products have some API-ish interface. OK, maybe
      it&#39;s just XML-wrapped CLI (aka NETCONF), but I rarely find something that
      could be configured solely through the vendor-specific GUI.

    html: Yes, API-ish.  I&#39;m trying to go through that.  Hard deciphering some
      of all that ish.

  html: Definitely not a simple project.  I&#39;ve been gradually working on this
    too.<br /><br />A point worth mentioning is how each solution is managed and orchestrated.  Does
    the vendor use their own GUI?  Are there programmatic interfaces?  How would it
    integrate into higher level orchestration tools? :)<br /><br />-Jason

  html: Thanks Ivan!  Definitely want to cover the virtual context systems on the
    physical firewalls as those offer a lot of flexibility when dealing with hybrid
    cloud models that you might not be able to get with VM based FWs.  VPN support
    directly into the tenant context is key for SP public cloud services and Fortigate
    does the best job there.  Last I heard, Cisco still did not have VPN support within
    the virtual contexts.  Juniper has solutions but I would stay away from the SRX
    line...too many issues.  Look at the Juniper ISGs if you go Juniper and even then,
    there are issues around VPN support.  They were also trying to EOL the ISG line
    at one point so they may have done that by now.
