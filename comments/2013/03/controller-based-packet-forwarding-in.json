          "html": "Of course it depends - on the functionality the controller vendor wants to implement, on the controller implementation (some open-source controllers are notoriously simplistic) and the capabilities of the physical switch (vanilla OpenFlow lacks too many features).<br /><br />CoPP has to be implemented in linecards (oops, OpenFlow switches). NEC has something similar to CoPP (unicast flooding limit), but that functionality is not part of OpenFlow, so they had to implement a proprietary extension that only works on their switches.",

      "html": "Ian,<br /><br />Great post as always.  Question, is the &quot;proactive&quot; and &quot;reactive&quot; options open to vendor implementations?  We have all seen the negative affects punting traffic has, so the OF controller would have to have some sort of control-plane policing (CoPP) implemented in the case of reactive-mode, or one, or a network anomoly could easily DDoS the controller.",
