Load balancers are often the public facing endpoint of an application these days instead of firewalls..

      "html": "Thanks Ivan!  Definitely want to cover the virtual context systems on the physical firewalls as those offer a lot of flexibility when dealing with hybrid cloud models that you might not be able to get with VM based FWs.  VPN support directly into the tenant context is key for SP public cloud services and Fortigate does the best job there.  Last I heard, Cisco still did not have VPN support within the virtual contexts.  Juniper has solutions but I would stay away from the SRX line...too many issues.  Look at the Juniper ISGs if you go Juniper and even then, there are issues around VPN support.  They were also trying to EOL the ISG line at one point so they may have done that by now.",
