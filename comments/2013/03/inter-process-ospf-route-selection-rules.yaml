  html: For OSPF it will be process that first installed route to RIB that wins. For
    EIRGP, lowest AS number is the tie breaker.<br /><br />&quot;Before Cisco bug
    ID CSCdw10987 (registered customers only) (integrated in Cisco IOS Software Releases
    12.2(07.04)S, 12.2(07.04)T, and later), the last process to make an shortest path
    first algorithm (SPF) would have won, and the two processes overwrite other routes
    in the routing table. Now, if a route is installed via one process, it is not
    overwritten by another OSPF process with the same administrative domain (AD),
    unless the route is first deleted from the routing table by the process that initially
    installed the route in the routing table.&quot;
