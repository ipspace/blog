            <div class="comment-content"><p>LS-1010 was a further developed version of A100. Cisco has acquired a smaller company (LightStream) to get this product.</p>

<p>LS-1010 was very much different from the competitors, since it had SVC support.</p>

            <div class="comment-content">About the 75xx buses:<br />

<p>&quot;CyBus&mdash;Cisco Extended Bus. A 1.067-gigabits-per-second (Gbps) data bus for
interface processors (two CyBuses are used in the Cisco 7507)&quot;</p>

<p>For the Cisco 7513 &quot;The dual-CyBus backplane has 13 slots: six interface processor slots, 0 through 5 (CyBus 0), five interface processor slots, 8 through 12 (CyBus 1)&quot;</p>

<p>I still remember one of my first tag switching POC shortly after I joined Cisco was with a 7200 with special software release (control plane) connected back to back to an ATM LS switch (data plane)</p>

            <div class="comment-content">To add on that:<br />
Cell-mode MPLS was heavily dependent of ATM PNNI to enable the routers a dynamic set-up of switched virtual circuits (SVCs) within the ATM network.<br />
Not sure when exactly PNNI was invented &amp; implemented and who came up with it, but I guess it must have been in the mid-90s...?<br />

<p>PNNI itself is, iirc, in essence nothing more than the ATM-incarnation of CLNS using OSI addressing and IS-IS routing - one of (if not the only one?) the rare cases to meet CLNS in the wild outside of SONET/SDH networks back in late 1990s / early to mid-2000s...</p>

<p>In frame-mode MPLS, ATM SVCs basically became LSPs and LDP (or RSVP) would take care of the &quot;circuit setup&quot;.</p>
