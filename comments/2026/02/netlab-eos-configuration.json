Since opening an SSH connection to a running container dumps you into the Linux shell where you need to execute <code>cli</code>, could netlab&#39;s arm be twisted into pre-generating and mounting the config files then running <code>root@r1:~# cli -c &amp;quot;configure; load merge /var/tmp/test2; commit and-quit&amp;quot;</code> ?</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can connect with <code>docker exec crpd cli</code> to get straight into the JunOS shell where you can enter config mode and load merge the configs.</p>\n\n<p>Am I wasting my time trying to get this to work?  If not, any guidance would be appreciated and I can open a PR if I succeed.</p>\n",
