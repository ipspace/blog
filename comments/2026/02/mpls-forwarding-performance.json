Not sure if it just looks the same or if it was really the same address space.\nThere was some constrained based routing, at least for the ATM service type &amp; bandwidth requirements, but I don&#39;t think you could do traffic engineering in terms of some sort of path control or link coloring like you can do f.e. with MPLS-TE.</p>\n",

I&#39;ve also seen a lot of people claiming that MPLS didn&#39;t provide faster forwarding, because it is all done in hardware. However, longest match required 4 lookups in the m-trie that was a 16-8-8 stride with the adjacency table being the 4th in CEF. A single exact match lookup on a label was much faster. In the end, if the forwarding ASIC is fast enough to run wire rate while still performing the 4 lookups, then it becomes moot.</p>\n",

The telecom vendors offering robust ATM were too expensive for many SPs and ATM might have been a bit difficult to support operationally.</p>\n\n<p>If I remember well, doing a hw lookup for the whole IP header was difficult, so the labels would make it faster to switch with the available hw.</p>\n\n<p>So, with MPLS you could get a lot of bandwidth, cheaper and reuse equipment. </p>\n\n<p>Try comparing though the software stack of eg AXD301 vs IOS. Was Cisco even capable to provide such software?</p>\n\n<p>I believe it was the time where cheap IP/ethernet/IT killed the quality and reliability of the telecom world, in favor of the quantity, for better and worse.</p>\n\n<p>What I see nowadays in EVPN/VXLAN is not that different from LANE 25y ago.</p>\n\n<p>Running PNNI instead of IS-IS for connecting the routers inside a SP network does not sound that different also.</p>\n",
