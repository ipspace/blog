            <div class="comment-content"><p>Well, transistor as a switch, switches as NAND gates, NAND gates as logic ICs, logic ICs and time bases as CPUs, CPU&#39;s viewed as an ISA, port a compiler to said ISA, then run an OS on it. </p>

<p>It teaches you abstraction. More importantly, it teaches you a lot about the right amount of abstraction to use.  Not too much, not too little. It teaches you how hardware works and understand the machine.  CPUs , GPU, and their ilk leak abstraction everywhere. if you need fast code (which more often than not you really do not) there you need to understand the beasts beneath.</p>

<p>It also teaches about communication on interfaces. About the right way to design interfaces. Id argue that even when abstraction doesn&#39;t leak a well designed interface will make or break your code / device / product whatever.</p>

<p>Besides being badass, I guess all this served you well. </p>
