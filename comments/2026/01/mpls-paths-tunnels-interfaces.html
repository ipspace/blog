the initial use case was improved forwarding performance 
(in particular, using ATM switches in IP network).
</pre>

<p>And I still don&#39;t agree.</p>

<p>The idea for tag-switching started supposedly in 1995. I joined cisco engineering in the summer of 1996. The first tag-switching BOF at the IETF was in December 1996.  https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/37/  I was in Europe at the time (cisco&#39;s first over-sea&#39;s DE). So I am sure I wasn&#39;t as up-to-date as others.</p>

<p>But this is what I heard: <br />
Large ISPs in the US were using an ATM underlay. Because they could do some form of TE in their ATM underlay. They paid Fore Systems a lot of money. Fore was the preferred ATM vendor at the time. Some people at cisco thought that money should go to cisco.  </p>

<p>This is what I saw:
In 1996, Ipsilon was making a lot of noise with their &quot;IP Switching&quot;. MPLS killed Ipsilon.</p>

<p>It turned out that the real killed-app for MPLS was BGP-MPLS-VPNs. That technology allowed the ISPs to sell a new service. And make lots of money off that service. I read somewhere (around 2012-2015) that 0.5% of ISPs worldwide were using MPLS-RSVP-TE. And 0.0% of enterprises worldwide. So imho, BGP-MPLS-VPNs is the only MPLS-related technology that really mattered.</p>

<p>Of course everyone&#39;s first idea was: &quot;when you do index-based forwarding, that must be faster than a short-length prefix lookup&quot;. It turned out it wasn&#39;t. People knew this very early on. Before any MPLS product shipped. I knew it, and I&#39;ve never been involved with forwarding code myself. I&#39;m sure you still don&#39;t believe me. So have a look at what Bruce Davie wrote: <br />

<pre>
The idea of speeding up the lookup operation on an IP datagram turned out to
have little practical impact. We even went as far as designing a router line card
that could forward labeled packets only, to test this out. The line card was
negligibly cheaper than a full-blown IP forwarding card, and no faster, because
by this point fast IP lookups, while not trivial, were largely a solved problem.
Buffering, switching among line cards, optical transceivers, etc., were all more
important to cost and performance than optimizing a few percent out of the
lookup engine.
