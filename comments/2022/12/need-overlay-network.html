            <div class="comment-content"><p>I don&#39;t know Russ well, but he might also simply say an overlay adds more complexity. (love this book!! https://www.amazon.com/Navigating-Network-Complexity-Next-generation-virtualization/dp/0133989356).</p>

<p>&quot;Impact on troubleshooting: how many solutions do we see in the market that can correlate underlay and overlay problems?&quot;</p>

<p>A new breed of Network AIOps platforms will do a better job of correlation up and down layers in the network as well as across different data types. Disclaimer, I work for a Network AIOps company working on that: https://augtera.com/augtera-networks-platform-for-network-aiops/</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>My colleagues at Magyar Telekom have solved this issue by a hybrid approach.
Create a simple network for non-critical entertainment or best effort type of traffic. Pure old Internet style, no expensive feature licenses. This is where you have the huge bandwidth need and uncontrollable growth.
Then build a parallel network on the same infrastructure with overlays, multi-service, and all other intelligence. This has less bandwidth needs and growth. 
At the end we had a dumb and an intelligent network on the same physical infrastructure where you could change the mix easily by DWDM lambda allocations.
It was so efficient financially, that the DT idea of Terastream had no chance in Hungary... :-)</p>
