Pure old Internet style, no expensive feature licenses. This is where you have the huge bandwidth need and uncontrollable growth.\nThen build a parallel network on the same infrastructure with overlays, multi-service, and all other intelligence. This has less bandwidth needs and growth. \nAt the end we had a dumb and an intelligent network on the same physical infrastructure where you could change the mix easily by DWDM lambda allocations.\nIt was so efficient financially, that the DT idea of Terastream had no chance in Hungary... :-)</p>\n",
