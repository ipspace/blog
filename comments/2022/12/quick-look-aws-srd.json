But SRD for all of webtraffic? Wouldn&#39;t be that bad. \nI read somewhere a few days ago that we should replace TCP in the datacenter; HA.. I found it again: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.00714.pdf \nThey&#39;re talking about &quot;Homa&quot;, I don&#39;t know enough application and transport stuff to know if the Homa idea is good or bad. And how it relates to SRD. </p>\n",
