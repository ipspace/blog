The route lookup then uses both a longest prefix match via TCAM and a CAM lookup for the designated prefix length to determine the next hop.</p>\n\n<p>Of course this requires CAM in addition to TCAM in the ASIC. I would expect that the ASIC&#39;s forwarding pipeline needs support for this scheme, too (e.g., CAM lookup results usually do not include the next hop rewrite information required for IP forwarding). So this is probably not applicable to the ASIC in question.</p>\n",
