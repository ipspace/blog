Then either add static default route towards the border routers&rsquo; anycast IP on all the LAN routers or advertise the same default BGP route via the anycast next hop to all clients. The recursive lookup to the anycast gateway will ensure load balancing by the IGP whether there are 2,3 or 4 border routers at a POP.     </p>\n",
