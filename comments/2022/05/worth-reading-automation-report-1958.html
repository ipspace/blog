            <div class="comment-content"><p>My opinion is that automation doesn&#39;t cause unemployment per se: people need to work and will find something else to do when made redundant by technology. The issue is: what will they do? Some people will move to better paid jobs that require better skills, some people will move to worse paid jobs that require less skills, some people will move to new jobs altogether that didn&#39;t exist before. Up to you to guess where the majority will end up.</p>
