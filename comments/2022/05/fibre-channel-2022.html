            <div class="comment-content"><p>I strongly recommend to go back to FC from iSCSi in my company, because no one wanted to pay for even one, not two separate Ethernet fabric. They&#39;re more happy to pay for old, refurbished FC gear, now.
And I can upgrade switches again without waiting endlessly for storage maintenance window.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I have nothing relevant to contribute, but just wanted to say thank you for the series of posts. Interesting how much valuable information can be triggered from a few questions about &quot;old&quot; technology in current days. </p>

<p>Oh, and the original question pretended to ask about FC vs <em>iSCSI</em> and NVMe-oF, not ATA-over-Ethernet (that was another example of old technology I was thinking of similar but not as widespread as FC, but I messed up the acronyms, sorry). </p>
