            <div class="comment-content"><p>P4 is not just for programming. It is intended to be used as generic pipeline architecture description language. The various pipeline architectures started in ONOS, but then they were tired of it and wanted to move downwards closer to the hardware, so the SDN controller would be more unified. Google had the power to enforce this, so Stratum was born. ONOS has a new variant written in GoLang called MicroONOS. This is a streamlined version that supports only P4 as a southbound API. So the SDN contoller would not have a zoo of drivers and a zoo of pipeline modules. The configuration complexity is now moved away from the SDN operator to the switch designer. However, the SDN controller code will be much more complex, since it needs to interpret P4. But the SDN operator has less work to do.
If an ASIC is not programmable, you could still write a generic network operation system using P4. This is the theory, but for simpler hardware OpenFlow is good enough and there are mature implementations. 
The P4 SDN development is rather slow, since there is not a big business drive for it. 
Some companies changed from open systems to closed systems. For example, HPE. They have recognized that many companies do not care, they just need a simple to operate solution. Interoperability with different vendors is just for nerds or telcos. Not for the average enterprise. They are happy with a black box, single vendor solution if it works enough well...</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hi, Ivan! Very nice article, thank you! May I ask about the use-cases you mentioned?
At the end of the article you said:
- Feature-rich Broadcom ASIC used on leaf switches,
- High-speed Broadcom ASIC used on spine switches</p>

<p>The other article from Juniper I found on the web (https://www.juniper.net/content/dam/www/assets/white-papers/us/en/routers/deploying-data-center-switching-solutions.pdf) was saying quite opposite:
- Low On-Chip Memory ASIC: High speed/low buffer leaf 
- Large External Memory ASIC: High speed/high buffer leaf and spine</p>

<p>Here (https://elegantnetwork.github.io/posts/A-Summary-of-Network-ASICs/) it says that &quot;Historically these chips (merchant silicon) have been used for ToR switches, but some networks especially hyperscalers are using them throughout the network, usually in the form of small fixed form factor (pizza boxes.)&quot;</p>

<p>I guess there is a naming confusing (e.g. do we call ToR as Leaf or no). May I ask you to clarify what is the best use-case of each type of ASIC?</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Memory and feature richness are orthogonal issues, you can have low memory and feature richness.  Typically in a lean spine fabric design you have features on the edge (leaf).  Only leafs terminating external and security services typically would need high buffer so you can use the right ASIC for the role. </p>
