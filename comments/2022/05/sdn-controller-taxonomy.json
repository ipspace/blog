There&#39;s also an option of creating tunnels &quot;out of thin air&quot;; I&#39;m assuming you need something like IGP autoroute to make them work.</p>\n",

         "html": "<p>OF took a beating because of the &quot;just send the unknown packet to the controller&quot; behaviour. It didn&#39;t scale at all, it was often the reason OF was cast as an &#39;academic&#39; pipe dream. In truth, to build a network that rivals MPLS-VPN you don&#39;t need that feature at all.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve often thought of trying to replace Openflow, OF signalling, Ethernet transport, etc. in the SDN and SDN controller with counterparts from the world of MPLS.  An SDN controller is essentially a PCE, replace the OF protocol with Netconf (or your flavor of the day).  PCEP comes close to what&#39;s required but something was always missing:</p>\n\n<p>The ability to send/detect crafted traffic from the control plane, through the data plane and back again is missing from any current IP network architecture I can think of.  In an OF SDN I can craft a packet in the controller, send that packet via the control plane to any switch and have that packet sent on a data plane link. I can program the rest of my switches to detect such a packet, stamp it, and send it back to the controller.  Need to detect physical links in an OF network? Need to send a packet down a customer pipe to confirm the service?  It was a really handy feature and I don&#39;t think it exists in the IP world today.  Without such a feature, we won&#39;t get true controller-based networks in IP.</p>\n\n<p>for background, i was at Juniper during the creation of Northstar, was a big internal user of the WANDL acquisition upon which it was based, and I ran the Telstra SDN for 3 years.</p>\n",
