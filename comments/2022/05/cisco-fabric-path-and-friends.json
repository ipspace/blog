Named &quot;FlexFabric&quot; (Datacenter) and &quot;FlexNetworks&quot; (Campus). The still run the ComwareOS (Version 7 now) and support EVPN/VXLAN. \nA hardware refresh happend last autumn. I know a few customer who use them in the campus or &#39;datacenter&#39; (10ish racks + VLANs) and the whole reason they use them is because &quot;We buy them every time&quot;. \nAruba launched a new SwitchOS (Aruba AOS-CX) a few years ago and they aim to built one OS for Access to Core to Datacenter. Works quite well for standard use cases including EVPN/VXLAN. \nBTW: Both Comware 7 and Aruba AOS-CX are available for virtualization, the last one free of charge.  </p>\n",
