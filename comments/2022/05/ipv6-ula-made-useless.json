I had 2 upstream Internet links:\n - a primary fast link dual-stacked to the ISP\n - a slow ADSL IPv4 only backup link with an he.net IPv6 tunnel</p>\n\n<p>A single router did NAT66 for the /64 blocks when traffic was routing over each uplink.</p>\n\n<p>I found devices always preferred IPv4 over IPv6-ULA. After hacking around on a Linux host I found where preferences were set, but they&#39;re horribly complex and you just can&#39;t fix other devices like Windows, Android, iOS, etc.</p>\n\n<p>So yes, a lot of docs say it should work but in real life it doesn&#39;t because the network stacks on almost all OS&#39;s are hard coded to prefer IPv4 over IPv6 ULA addresses.</p>\n\n<p>I reverted to using my he.net assigned public /64 on the LAN, and NAT66 when going over the other uplink. Real public IPv6 is preferred over IPv4, so it works as expected. But not ULA.</p>\n",

Using ULA did not work.</p>\n\n<p>ULA was treated identically to GUA. If one added ULA addressing for local only IPv6 tests to an existing IPv4 network with Internet connectivity, Internet connectivity would break (no <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6555\">Happy Eyeballs</a> or <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8305\">Happy Eyeballs v2</a>), or it would be slower due to trying IPv4 later than IPv6.</p>\n\n<p>Unique Local Addresses were worse than useless, they were harmful, because local use of Unique Local Addresses negatively affected global connectivity.</p>\n\n<p>(This problem was documented in <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5220#section-2.2.2\">RFC 5220 section 2.2.2</a> from 2008, referenced in RFC 6724.)</p>\n\n<p>Useless, but no longer harmful, ULA could be seen as an improvement. :-)</p>\n",
