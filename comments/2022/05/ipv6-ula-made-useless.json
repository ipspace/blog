I had 2 upstream Internet links:\n - a primary fast link dual-stacked to the ISP\n - a slow ADSL IPv4 only backup link with an he.net IPv6 tunnel</p>\n\n<p>A single router did NAT66 for the /64 blocks when traffic was routing over each uplink.</p>\n\n<p>I found devices always preferred IPv4 over IPv6-ULA. After hacking around on a Linux host I found where preferences were set, but they&#39;re horribly complex and you just can&#39;t fix other devices like Windows, Android, iOS, etc.</p>\n\n<p>So yes, a lot of docs say it should work but in real life it doesn&#39;t because the network stacks on almost all OS&#39;s are hard coded to prefer IPv4 over IPv6 ULA addresses.</p>\n\n<p>I reverted to using my he.net assigned public /64 on the LAN, and NAT66 when going over the other uplink. Real public IPv6 is preferred over IPv4, so it works as expected. But not ULA.</p>\n",
