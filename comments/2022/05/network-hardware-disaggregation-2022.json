         "html": "<p>P4 is not just for programming. It is intended to be used as generic pipeline architecture description language. The various pipeline architectures started in ONOS, but then they were tired of it and wanted to move downwards closer to the hardware, so the SDN controller would be more unified. Google had the power to enforce this, so Stratum was born. ONOS has a new variant written in GoLang called MicroONOS. This is a streamlined version that supports only P4 as a southbound API. So the SDN contoller would not have a zoo of drivers and a zoo of pipeline modules. The configuration complexity is now moved away from the SDN operator to the switch designer. However, the SDN controller code will be much more complex, since it needs to interpret P4. But the SDN operator has less work to do.\nIf an ASIC is not programmable, you could still write a generic network operation system using P4. This is the theory, but for simpler hardware OpenFlow is good enough and there are mature implementations. \nThe P4 SDN development is rather slow, since there is not a big business drive for it. \nSome companies changed from open systems to closed systems. For example, HPE. They have recognized that many companies do not care, they just need a simple to operate solution. Interoperability with different vendors is just for nerds or telcos. Not for the average enterprise. They are happy with a black box, single vendor solution if it works enough well...</p>\n",
