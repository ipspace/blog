However, with a pipeline split out with multiple concurrent lookups, you can average 8 packets per nanosecond... While still only processing one packet per few tens of nanoseconds.</p>\n\n<p>If you think about it, let&#39;s say it takes 3 days to produce a car on a factory line, that means a little over 100 cars per year. To reach 10,000 cars per year, you can either have 100 lines, or take the most lengthy part of the process are parallelize just that component.</p>\n\n<p>You maintain the one-in, one-out, but you&#39;re now increasing the average rate. That&#39;s why the total delay is still in the hundreds of nanoseconds, it&#39;s parallelized.</p>\n",
