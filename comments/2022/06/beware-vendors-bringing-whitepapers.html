            <div class="comment-content"><p>Any chance the DC landscape of 2014 could have influenced their recommendations?</p>

<p>I think they still had two competing L2 fabric solutions (QFabric and VCF), and VXLAN was either CRB or mcast flood and learn.</p>

<p>Unsure if these would justify their position at the time, that and the fact that they didn&#39;t have a Jericho platform until 2021?</p>

            <div class="comment-content">IIRC: Juniper was late to market with newer-generation Trident leaf switches that had VXLAN RIOT support, so they were trying to push centralized VXLAN-to-VXLAN routing on spine switches, and that could only be done (in those days) on QFX10K.<br />

<p>I would be acceptable if they would have written &quot;use QFX10K as spine switches to get VXLAN routing, because Broadcom didn&#39;t implement it in Tomahawk ASIC&quot;. Still bending the truth by omission (because VXLAN routing did work in newer Trident ASICs), but it wouldn&#39;t be plain wrong like their buffering argument.</p>
