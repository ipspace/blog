         "html": "<p>question:\nOne might think (based on the active-active forwarding discussion) that you have to synchronize ARP entries due to misdirected ARP replies &ndash; S1 sends an ARP request to A, but A replies over the A-S2 link &ndash; but that doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>\n\n<p>Ans:Thats because when S1 send ARP reply, forwarding(L3 decision) might have been still on A-S1 link, but mlag hash would have been resolved to use A-S2 link. So, now, at S2, because S2 knows that DMAC is of S1, it must send that that ARP reply packet  over ISL Link to S1, otherwise, traffic will be dropped.\nhope that is clear.</p>\n",
