            <div class="comment-content"><p>Interesting project which got more and more functionality over time. For me a big hurdle is to have an overview of the data models you guys have created. Is there a UML diagram or the like? <br />
IMO with a visual representation of the data models it would be easier to understand the (bowl of spaghetti) code and know what to expect for device data. Once outcome of device data is known then Jinja2 templates can be created. <br />
Apart from that the project seems to be well documented.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>The &quot;developer documentation&quot; for most of the features I mentioned describes the device data models you need to create the Jinja2 templates, and there are several independent implementations for each of those features that you can use as a boilerplate template.</p>

<p>That should be more than good enough for anyone seriously interested in adding value, but if those documents are unclear, I would love to hear how to make them easier to understand. Even better: fix them and submit a PR.</p>
