            <div class="comment-content"><p>Interesting project which got more and more functionality over time. For me a big hurdle is to have an overview of the data models you guys have created. Is there a UML diagram or the like? <br />
IMO with a visual representation of the data models it would be easier to understand the (bowl of spaghetti) code and know what to expect for device data. Once outcome of device data is known then Jinja2 templates can be created. <br />
Apart from that the project seems to be well documented.</p>
