            <div class="comment-content"><p>The next fun part starts when trying to run BFD on the MLAG. 
Scenario; 
There are 20 VMs running on servers connected to both switches, 
vSwitch with single LAG uplink on each server, 
static routes are created to anycast service IP on each VM, configured on switches to same /32 via 20 gateways, 
you want to use BFD to track next hop reach-ability...</p>

<p>Running a routing protocol with a neighbor connected via MLAG is also interesting. (peer routing)</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>question:
One might think (based on the active-active forwarding discussion) that you have to synchronize ARP entries due to misdirected ARP replies &ndash; S1 sends an ARP request to A, but A replies over the A-S2 link &ndash; but that doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>

<p>Ans:Thats because when S1 send ARP reply, forwarding(L3 decision) might have been still on A-S1 link, but mlag hash would have been resolved to use A-S2 link. So, now, at S2, because S2 knows that DMAC is of S1, it must send that that ARP reply packet  over ISL Link to S1, otherwise, traffic will be dropped.
hope that is clear.</p>
