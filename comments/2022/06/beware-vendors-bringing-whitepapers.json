         "html": "IIRC: Juniper was late to market with newer-generation Trident leaf switches that had VXLAN RIOT support, so they were trying to push centralized VXLAN-to-VXLAN routing on spine switches, and that could only be done (in those days) on QFX10K.<br />\n\n<p>I would be acceptable if they would have written &quot;use QFX10K as spine switches to get VXLAN routing, because Broadcom didn&#39;t implement it in Tomahawk ASIC&quot;. Still bending the truth by omission (because VXLAN routing did work in newer Trident ASICs), but it wouldn&#39;t be plain wrong like their buffering argument.</p>\n",

The WP definitely was not on our public website. But surprised that you were able to get through the link. Anyway, we just took it down. Sorry for any confusion. BTW, our DC portfolio kinda kicks ass now with Apstra running DF fabric automation &amp; mgmt. We&#39;re getting a ton of great customer feedback.</p>\n",

For example: 100-Gig uses 4x 25 Gig lanes while a 40-Gig port uses 10-Gig lanes, etc... Do you think this matters at all or is it just a factor of total port-speed regardless of number or speed of lanes?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m inclined to think where we&#39;re buffering doesn&#39;t really know or care what lane configuration is used as at that point it&#39;s abstracted and only knows raw total speed but I&#39;m not totally sure honestly.
