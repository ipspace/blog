I find it more accurate to draw two WAN edge switches per data center for the sake of redundancy (resulting in at least two WAN connections) as there are already two LAN peers per data center in the diagram. <br />\nI&#39;ve never saw a multi-site EVPN VXLAN implementation in production. IMO it&#39;s too complex and cumbersome. I only saw multi-pod implementations for multiple data centers even for larger deployments which ran just fine.</p>\n",
