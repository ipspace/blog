Even better: fix them and submit a PR.</p>\n",

Is there a UML diagram or the like? <br />\nIMO with a visual representation of the data models it would be easier to understand the (bowl of spaghetti) code and know what to expect for device data. Once outcome of device data is known then Jinja2 templates can be created. <br />\nApart from that the project seems to be well documented.</p>\n",
