            <div class="comment-content"><p>In addition, even when we look at how inter-pod or intra-pod kubernetes containers apply filtering - it&#39;s a plugin to kubernetes itself. From there policies are applied outside of the actual container at the cluster plugin level... again using arbitrary tags.. or ip addresses which make much less sense in a mutable infrastructure.  </p>

<p>Aside from this, I believe aws uses geneve with their newer  gateway load balancer.. taking advantage of the variable length object field in the geneve packet to segment traffic based on vpc or any other aws object id&#39;s. This of course pushed nfv vendors to support geneve so they can still be cloud relevant. </p>

<p>Very interesting.. how far we have extended the functionality of a basic firewall - from a packet filter to stateful, to l7 ids/ips and now to use variable length arbitrary tagging with millions of tenants or tunnels.</p>
