For example two co-located PE routers have iBGP with each other and the RRs. The RR is then also configured not to reflect to clients with the same cluster ID. (no bgp client-to-client reflection intra-cluster cluster-id any). Reflection can also be disabled for a list of specific cluster-IDs.</p>\n",
