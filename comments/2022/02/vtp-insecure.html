            <div class="comment-content"><p>Since the beginning of time, SR OS has had the notion of different port types:
* Network facing ports (default)
* User-facing access ports (untrusted)
* Hybrid ports</p>

<p>For example, VXLAN is not accepted on user facing ports. I am pretty sure VTP isn&#39;t supported (though there may be others - all vendors have their oversights)</p>

<p>Time for a Netsim-Tools &quot;hardening&quot; plugin?</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>&quot;Would it be really THAT hard to have two sets of defaults for core (trusted) and edge (hardened) ports&quot; </p>

<p>Whilst I&#39;ve never seen this as out of the box configuration this has been pretty much standard procedure for years in the same way you apply root guard, storm control, mac address limits, DHCP snooping and DAI.</p>

<p>Whilst its interesting that you can write a short script to hijack VTP, I would consider your network poorly designed if you have VTP enabled on access ports.</p>

<p>If we are going down the rabbit hole of badly configured access ports;</p>

<p>switchport mode dynamic auto.</p>

<p>Yeah, we can invoke the magic power of automation and declare Mission Accomplished... but as vendors love to throw tons of new features into the kitchen sink called <em>Network Operating System</em>, how do you know your hardened configuration is up-to-date and secure?</p>
