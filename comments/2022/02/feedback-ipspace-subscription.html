It&#39;s the difference between a vendor-powered network &#39;technician&#39; and a 
proper network engineer to me. Engineer It&#39;s an abused term in our network industry. <br />
It&#39;s THE next level knowledge stage and it&#39;s pretty rare these days as it requires an unconditional passion for the truth and thus for how things work rather than a practical interest for just making things work. <br />
This is also the reason why to me Certifications should never be part of a proper academic course on telecom/network engineering.    </p>
