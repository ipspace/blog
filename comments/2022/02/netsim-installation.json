There&#39;s no &quot;this is how you add a new provider&quot; documentation at the moment, but it&#39;s not THAT hard.</p>\n\n<p>First you have to figure out what provisioning system to use. Vagrant has a hyper-v provider, so that&#39;s a pretty good start.</p>\n\n<p>Next you have to choose the devices you want to support under Hyper-V, create build recipes for them (nobody is shipping Vagrant boxes for Hyper-V), and create corresponding Vagrantfile templates. You&#39;ll also have to figure out how to create virtual networks with Hyper-V provider.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ll also have to add the new provider to system settings etc. At that point you might need help: you can open a GitHub issue, ask a question in #netsim-tools channel in Network2Code Slack team, or send me an email.</p>\n\n<p>When you&#39;re done, update the documentation and submit a PR against the <em>dev</em> branch.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n",
