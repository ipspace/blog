ECMP forwarding is preserved because there is a &#39;multipath&#39; action that is evaluated for each packet; I know because I personally fixed the hashing (https://mail.openvswitch.org/pipermail/ovs-dev/2019-June/359489.html)</p>\n\n<p>This implementation is not quite so &quot;obsolete&quot; as one might think; for example, 1000s of Nuage VRS/NSGs use it as we speak</p>\n",
