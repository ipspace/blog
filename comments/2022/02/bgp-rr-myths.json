If not, you would have snowflakes (https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/12/worth-reading-snowflake-network-devices.html). This is especially true for a cluster of &#39;pure&#39; route reflectors that only do control plane and no packet forwarding.</p>\n\n<p>So: Do we need iBGP sessions between truly equivalent, fully connected route reflectors?</p>\n",
