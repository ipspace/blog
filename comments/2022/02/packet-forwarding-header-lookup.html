            <div class="comment-content"><p>LISP is a difficult animal. It has multiple variants.
Nowadays, lot of people use it with PubSub and reliable transport.
This is very much different from the original LISP. It is not a pull model anymore.</p>

<p>Since with PubSub new routes are pushed as soon as possible, there is no real caching problem.</p>

<p>However, selective subscription is not implemented yet by Cisco, so it is a half baked solution. All of your xTRs will have a full routing table, that might be OK for a LAN, but not for a bigger WAN. This global PubSub is creating a potential scalability problem. Let us hope, that selective subscription will be implemented sometimes in the future... Then it might become useful in bigger WANs.</p>

<p>LISP has a big advantage compared to BGP. No best path selection, so it is much faster. It is the ideal protocol for network mobility, especially for multi-link, multi-homed scenarios.
However, this use case requires a lot of further development yet...</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>It seems to me that the PubSub LISP you described is functionally equivalent to a well-implemented BGP route reflector with RT-based ORF (or whatever that thing is called). </p>

<p>The only icing missing from that cake seems to be a fast BGP route selection mechanism -- after all, if a node only has sessions with IBGP RRs, and if the network designer claims they should be sending identical information, why go through the route selection at all? Just take whatever comes in. What am I missing?</p>

<p>Thanks a million! Ivan</p>
