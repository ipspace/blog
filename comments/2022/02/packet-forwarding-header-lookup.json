Just take whatever comes in. What am I missing?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks a million! Ivan</p>\n",

         "html": "<p>LISP is a difficult animal. It has multiple variants.\nNowadays, lot of people use it with PubSub and reliable transport.\nThis is very much different from the original LISP. It is not a pull model anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Since with PubSub new routes are pushed as soon as possible, there is no real caching problem.</p>\n\n<p>However, selective subscription is not implemented yet by Cisco, so it is a half baked solution. All of your xTRs will have a full routing table, that might be OK for a LAN, but not for a bigger WAN. This global PubSub is creating a potential scalability problem. Let us hope, that selective subscription will be implemented sometimes in the future... Then it might become useful in bigger WANs.</p>\n\n<p>LISP has a big advantage compared to BGP. No best path selection, so it is much faster. It is the ideal protocol for network mobility, especially for multi-link, multi-homed scenarios.\nHowever, this use case requires a lot of further development yet...</p>\n",
