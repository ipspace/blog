This allows to use a path that is shorter by one router hop.  Thus it is an optimization that <em>should</em> not be needed for correct packet transport.  Thus if this <em>optimization</em> results in <em>worse</em> performance, it seems prudent to disable it.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen many networks that function fine with disabled ICMP redirects.  Those include both networks with manually disabled ICMP redirects and those where vendor defaults regarding disabled ICMP redirects were kept.</p>\n\n<p>I can think of situations where an extra hop leads to problems due to TTL (think of <em>hop count</em>), but in such a situation the root cause is using a too low TTL value or lack of (or misconfigured) dynamic routing to ensure use of the intended path.</p>\n\n<p>Another possibility I can think of could be overloaded links due to using a suboptimal gateway.  But this can only be mitigated by ICMP redirects if ICMP redirect processing does not significantly impact forwarding performance by itself.</p>\n\n<p>I am well aware that I cannot know all possible scenarios and thus would like to learn of an example where ICMP redirects make the network work.</p>\n\n<p>[BTW in the scenario described in the blog post, changing the active gateway according to uplink state (e.g., via interface or object tracking and preemption) would have avoided ICMP redirect generation, too.]</p>\n",

(Granted, those problems are usually of the &quot;why would you design a network like this???&quot; variety, and are better served by a redesign than by disabling or enabling ICMP Redirects.)</p>\n\n<p>A &quot;more correct&quot; solution than to disable redirects, since the client using Nexus hardware, might be to deploy vPC and use vPC Peer Gateway instead of HSRP in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Put another way, the presence <em>or</em> absence of ICMP Redirects is a red herring, usually pointing to architectural/design issues instead.  In this example, using vPC Peer Gateway or, better yet, running a minimal IGP instead of relying on static routes, eliminates ICMP Redirects from both the problem and solution spaces simultaneously.</p>\n",

Back in the old days(late 80s early 90s) where you had a segment with two routers connected to it some used ICMP redirect as a poor man&rsquo;s fail over solution. \nYou would set your workstation&#39;s default GW to your own address and ARP on everything but if an upstream prefix was not available on R1, R1 would send ICMP redirect to your workstation to go to R2 for that prefix, you ARP, then go through R2. If you lost R1 completely you would ARP anyway and get R2. \nI believe this was before you can have two default GWs set or before DHCP to set GW.</p>\n\n<p>A bit chatty on the wire but it worked.</p>\n",
