(Granted, those problems are usually of the &quot;why would you design a network like this???&quot; variety, and are better served by a redesign than by disabling or enabling ICMP Redirects.)</p>\n\n<p>A &quot;more correct&quot; solution than to disable redirects, since the client using Nexus hardware, might be to deploy vPC and use vPC Peer Gateway instead of HSRP in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Put another way, the presence <em>or</em> absence of ICMP Redirects is a red herring, usually pointing to architectural/design issues instead.  In this example, using vPC Peer Gateway or, better yet, running a minimal IGP instead of relying on static routes, eliminates ICMP Redirects from both the problem and solution spaces simultaneously.</p>\n",
