Engineer It&#39;s an abused term in our network industry. <br />\nIt&#39;s THE next level knowledge stage and it&#39;s pretty rare these days as it requires an unconditional passion for the truth and thus for how things work rather than a practical interest for just making things work. <br />\nThis is also the reason why to me Certifications should never be part of a proper academic course on telecom/network engineering.    </p>\n\n<p>cheers/ciao <br />\nAndrea   </p>\n",
