            <div class="comment-content"><p>Appreciate you sharing your insights and lessons learnt from the past.</p>

<p>I think I may know where that silly notion came from, and you are right of course: One can construct a network topology in which iBGP between route reflectors is useful/required.</p>

<p>However, in a topology where the route reflectors are intended as equivalent redundant options to form a full iBGP mesh, they would (normally) each have the exact same connectivity to other devices. If not, you would have snowflakes (https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/12/worth-reading-snowflake-network-devices.html). This is especially true for a cluster of &#39;pure&#39; route reflectors that only do control plane and no packet forwarding.</p>

<p>So: Do we need iBGP sessions between truly equivalent, fully connected route reflectors?</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>How about &quot;Without that full mesh you&rsquo;re losing redundancy.&quot; and &quot;The need for the IBGP sessions between spine switches diminishes if as the number of spine switches grows unless someone &ldquo;wisely&rdquo; decided to use only two of the spines as route reflectors&quot;</p>

<p>As always, pick your poison (aka &quot;it depends&quot;), and whatever you do, make sure you know what you&#39;re doing as opposed to following PowerPoint-based &quot;best practices&quot;</p>
