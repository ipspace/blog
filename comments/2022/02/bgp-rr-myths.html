<p>I think I may know where that silly notion came from, and you are right of course: One can construct a network topology in which iBGP between route reflectors is useful/required.</p>

<p>However, in a topology where the route reflectors are intended as equivalent redundant options to form a full iBGP mesh, they would (normally) each have the exact same connectivity to other devices. If not, you would have snowflakes (https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/12/worth-reading-snowflake-network-devices.html). This is especially true for a cluster of &#39;pure&#39; route reflectors that only do control plane and no packet forwarding.</p>

<p>So: Do we need iBGP sessions between truly equivalent, fully connected route reflectors?</p>
