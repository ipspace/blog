            <div class="comment-content"><p>There&#39;s an easy way to solve that problem. Send all of your staff to a Scrum class. Most of them will become developer. Some of them will become Scrum master. In the end they will write a certification exam and pass. The company then has a lot of testified &quot;agile&quot; employees.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I really don&#39;t see how a network any larger and more complex than a small and simple enterprise or campus network can be developed and engineered in a consistent manner without full automation. At least routing intensive networks might have very complex configurations related to e.g. routing policies and it would be next to impossible to configure them manually, at least without errors and in a consistent way. </p>

<p>With automation even the most complex configurations can be presented with a simple abstraction and should one need to implement any architectural change in the network, one can build the logics only once and let the automation multiply it into the running configs. We have a lot of examples of such, for example policy frameworks for BGP SOO filtering, BGP large community based selective route filtering, prefix segment injection with correct SIDs, RPKI ROA validation configurations etc. Without automation it would be also very difficult to enforce the desired configurations and would result in an opportunistic network where certain configurations are only applied if an engineer has remembered to, or cared to, configure them.</p>

<p>By the way, I think that &quot;automation&quot; is not actually the best word to describe this whole thing and I&#39;d rather talk about programmatic approach to network configuration. Ironically, I think that Software Defined Networking would be a perfect term, if only SDN hadn&#39;t gain such a bad reputation during recent years when it was used exclusively for just about anything. Maybe &quot;network configuration as a code&quot; would describe pretty well what is usually referred to as &quot;automation&quot;.</p>
