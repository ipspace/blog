<p>It was easy to figure out the thinking behind BGPv1 though. In those days RFCs explained why things were done a certain way.</p>

<p>IETF is supposed to be a community and RFCs are supposed to be community documents, but of course that never stopped anyone...</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>It&#39;s not that simple.</p>

<p>Example. It seems you praise the first BGP RFC. As you wrote, that RFC was written by Yakov. I remember reading the BGP-4 RFC when I started working at a router vendor. Also written by Yakov. The BGP-4 RFC was mostly unreadable, imho. Years later, I worked with Yakov. I asked him &quot;why is the BGP-4 RFC written in that style? I found it almost unreadable. If you know how BGP-4 works, the text might make sense. But if you are new, it doesn&#39;t teach (or explain) you anything&quot;.</p>

<p>That is when Yakov said: &quot;We are not in the business of educating our competition&quot;.</p>

<p>That answer made me look completely different towards the art of writing RFCs. Earlier on, I believed that RFCs should be texts that explain how and why protocols do what they do. See RFC5302. It is an RFC about a single bit. But I tried to include a lot of useful info in it. Because I wanted to clarify the preference of different types of routes.</p>

<p>But later I changed my mind. I think an RFC should just describe packet-formats. And maybe a little about behaviour, state-machines, etc. But only the minimum to allow people to write interoperable implementations. That should be enough. It also might allow people to improve on a protocol later, without breaking backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>Some companies put a lot of effort into moving technology forward. You might think they do that for evil purposes. But there are other companies that do not wish to invest any time or money into improving standards. They just take the work (RFCs, protocols, ideas) from others, implement it cheaply, and try to sell a product that is cheaper than the competition&#39;s. Personally I do not wish to make their work easier. The next time I get the opportunity to write a draft of RFC, the text will be as concise as possible.</p>

<p>Every time something good emerges, the bottom feeders destroy it by their greed.</p>

<p>Speaking of true bottom feeders, seems like reposting other people&#39;s blog posts  to get ad revenue doesn&#39;t pay off as much as it did in the past. I&#39;m glad I persisted through those waves of hyena attacks.</p>
