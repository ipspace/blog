            <div class="comment-content"><p>i think there is a more fundamental reason than the (in my opinion simplistic) lack of skills argument. As someone mentioned on twitter</p>

<p>&quot;Rules make it harder to enact change. Automation is essentially a set of rules.&quot;</p>

<p>We underestimated the fact that infrastructure is a value differentiator for many and that customization and rapid change don&#39;t go hand in hand with automation.  </p>

<p>Which, if sold right, can be a good thing. I&#39;ve called this &quot;inflexible flexibility&quot;. We can do absolutely anything, but it&#39;ll take some effort to add it to the data model and tool chain that generates the configurations. After that, it&#39;ll be 100% supported and won&#39;t ever be something that only the one engineer that implemented the one instance knows about, catching someone else off guard at 2am when it breaks. It means no more one-ofs, and that changes are inherently documented at the very least by merit of being part of a codebase with a commit that can be tracked down.</p>

<p>I have sometimes gotten some pushback on how this is inherently less nimble since it takes longer than just throwing a manual config at a problem, but so far haven&#39;t had any issues with the counterargument that we don&#39;t want untested configuration changes, and that developing a new feature for the automation process doesn&#39;t take <em>much</em> longer than properly testing a new configuration in a lab before rolling it out. The additional time is easily made up by the increased reliability of the change being executed a second time (where I mean reliability in the sense of &quot;the customer expected the change to work the first time&quot;). Of course, this partly depends on how your exact automation process. Ours is amenable to fairly rapid changes, because our campus network is quite dynamic.</p>

<p>Yes, having to run everything through an automation pipeline is less rapid than just ssh&#39;ing into a box and typing away. But it doesn&#39;t have to be much less rapid if your staff is skilled, and raising the bar to entry for a change can often mean an opportunity for evaluation on whether the work <em>should</em> be done, which is a very different question than whether it <em>can</em> be done.</p>
