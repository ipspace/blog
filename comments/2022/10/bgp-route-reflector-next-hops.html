            <div class="comment-content"><p>&gt; There&rsquo;s a single vendor I&rsquo;m aware of who realized the SNAFU and implemented EVPN in a way that violates the usual EBGP expectations.</p>

<p>I know of two, with a hint regarding a third (with the third based on work from the first).
I expect the first to be the one you have in mind.

<p>&gt; Anything else? Please leave a comment!</p>

<p>I have seen an MPLS design using RFC 3107 BGP-LU to build transport LSPs across IGP regions. They used IBGP with RRs. The region border routers were RRs that changed the next hop to themselves and generating a BGP-LU label.</p>

<p>P.S. Sorry for the acronym soup.</p>
