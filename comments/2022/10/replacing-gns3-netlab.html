            <div class="comment-content"><p>&gt; Does netlab support external connections through virbr?</p>

<p>Not directly (as in &quot;that cannot be configured&quot;) but if you use netlab with libvirt or containerlab, then the underlying network connectivity is implemented with Linux bridges, and of course you can link them with anything you like.</p>

<p>&gt; you can connect the two and enjoy the features of both (e.g. building a fabric with netlab but having some services like Arista CVP, DHCP, DNS, etc. on network(s) created in GNS3).</p>

<p>Why would you want to do that if you can run a Linux VM or container (in both cases with custom image if you so wish) as part of netlab lab topology?</p>
