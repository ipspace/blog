            <div class="comment-content"><p>if ABR changed the advertising router as the question states you would abstract the true cost to reach the ASBR.  That defeats fundamental purpose of an IGP.  Moy et al probably would have gazed in awe of the question. 
Today it seems people have become so accustomed to BGP as the ONE solution to all problems that we see questions like &quot;Why doesn&#39;t my IGP behave like BGP?&quot;  When does the BGP camel&#39;s back break?</p>
