            <div class="comment-content"><p>This does raise a question I have had for a long time, - why does LDP not preserve imported labels so that a destination always has the same label on every router? This would have meant that MPLS could be more efficient as label lookups would consist of only looking up the outbound interface for a packet.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Remember that the original MPLS idea was to have a better control plane for ATM networks that had &#39;traditional&#39; virtual circuits. Label space was scarce and ATM switches had per-interface label space.</p>

<p>Network-wide labels just wouldn&#39;t work in that environment.</p>
