I was curious about the end-of-frame delimitation in the original Ethernet, but never found how (rudimentarily) it was implemented. </p>\n\n<p>Faster Ethernet implementations do not employ Manchester, so the trick of &quot;no symbol transition and CRC passes&quot; is no longer valid for the (most widely used) DIX encapsulation. As far as I understand, they always rely on a special control code of the 4B5B (or 8B10B, 64B66B, ...) line code. </p>\n",
