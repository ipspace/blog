            <div class="comment-content"><p>Experienced similar issues in 90ties when migrated Customer from X25 Eicon interface PC adapters to Cisco 2500 with RS232D. It ended up with P1 at Cisco TAC. We had to implement hw fix (some cable modification).</p>

<p>Beautiful times!</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Had a very similar problem in the 90s at a remote site in Tahiti randomly dropping out. Eventually I found I could also trigger it with a &quot;wr t&quot; and then narrowed it down to the single line of config.  The local service provider kept refusing to believe it was anything to do with them. </p>

<p>In the end I had to travel there &#x1F642; with a protocol analyzer (international customs nightmare). I recreated it in front of their eyes and stayed their until they replaced the line driver/baseband modem - which they previously said they had already done.  One of the more bizarre faults</p>
