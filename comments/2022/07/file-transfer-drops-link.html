            <div class="comment-content"><p>Had a very similar problem in the 90s at a remote site in Tahiti randomly dropping out. Eventually I found I could also trigger it with a &quot;wr t&quot; and then narrowed it down to the single line of config.  The local service provider kept refusing to believe it was anything to do with them. </p>

<p>In the end I had to travel there &#x1F642; with a protocol analyzer (international customs nightmare). I recreated it in front of their eyes and stayed their until they replaced the line driver/baseband modem - which they previously said they had already done.  One of the more bizarre faults</p>
