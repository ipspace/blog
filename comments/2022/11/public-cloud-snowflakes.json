For the physical network we designed a textbook L3 Clos that provided one IP address per server. No VLANs, etc. Fully automated through Ansible ;-) even though the config was completely static. Everything else will be handled by OpenStack.</p>\n\n<p>Then we start talking to the OpenStack vendors and every one requires VLANs. And not for any good reason either; it looks like they just cargo-culted ideas from previous VMware best practices. So now the underlay has to have EVPN and the config is 10x bigger and more fragile. And of course OpenStack has its own overlay so there&#39;s double encapsulation (I carefully configured MTUs everywhere so users could remain unaware).</p>\n",
