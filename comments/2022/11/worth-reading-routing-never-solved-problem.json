               "html": "<p>I&#39;m happy to hear routing is not a solved problem. :) <br />\nBut for the rest, I&#39;m not sure I agree with Mark.  </p>\n\n<p>&gt; There will never be perfect information</p>\n\n<p>This touches a core principle of routing. <br />\nWe gain scalability because of 2 things: hierarchy and summarization. <br />\nBut as soon as you summarize something, you lose some information. <br />\nThis is indeed a choice that the operator must make (to summarize or not). <br />\nBut you can&#39;t have both: reduction of information and perfect information.  </p>\n\n<p>&gt; There will always be an area of futzing to find optimization points <br />\n&gt; across multiple competing objectives  </p>\n\n<p>When this is configurable, each customer can tweak his network. <br />\nI don&#39;t see this as a reason why networking is not a solved problem.  </p>\n\n<p>&gt; just beginning .... much discovery yet to happen  </p>\n\n<p>What problems are you thinking about?  </p>\n\n<p>All the problems that I see as reasons why routing is not a solved <br />\nproblem, were already known problems 25-30 years ago. <br />\nWe aren&#39;t done yet, not because of new incoming problems. <br />\nWe are not done yet, because so little real progress has been made.  </p>\n\n<p>Physics, timing, ordering, I don&#39;t see those as limitations. <br />\nWe know how to deal with those things. <br />\nDifferent requirements for different networks: <br />\njust implement everything, and then make stuff configurable.  </p>\n\n<p>The problems I see with routing are: <br />\n*) site multi-homing <br />\n*) host multi-homing <br />\n*) easy renumbering (with persistent connections during the renumbering) <br />\n*) mobility  </p>\n\n<p>To solve some of those, we should have true identifier/locator separation. <br />\nNot an after-thought like LISP. <br />\nBut something built into the layer-3 addressing architecture. <br />\nIPv6 was a chance, but we messed that chance up.  </p>\n\n<p>You could add a few more practical issue: <br />\nLike trustworthiness of BGP global routes.</p>\n\n<p>As I said earlier, how can we do hierarchy (in IGPs, with areas), <br />\nand still have all our features work across ABRs? In a scalable way. <br />\nFrom my perspective we don&#39;t really have that yet.  </p>\n\n<p>Another issue is configuration and troubleshooting. <br />\nI think we can make improvements there (and make running a network easier).  </p>\n",
