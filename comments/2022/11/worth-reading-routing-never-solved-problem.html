            <div class="comment-content"><p>I&#39;m happy to hear routing is not a solved problem. :) <br />
But for the rest, I&#39;m not sure I agree with Mark.  </p>

<p>&gt; There will never be perfect information</p>

<p>This touches a core principle of routing. <br />
We gain scalability because of 2 things: hierarchy and summarization. <br />
But as soon as you summarize something, you lose some information. <br />
This is indeed a choice that the operator must make (to summarize or not). <br />
But you can&#39;t have both: reduction of information and perfect information.  </p>

<p>&gt; There will always be an area of futzing to find optimization points <br />
&gt; across multiple competing objectives  </p>

<p>When this is configurable, each customer can tweak his network. <br />
I don&#39;t see this as a reason why networking is not a solved problem.  </p>

<p>&gt; just beginning .... much discovery yet to happen  </p>

<p>What problems are you thinking about?  </p>

<p>All the problems that I see as reasons why routing is not a solved <br />
problem, were already known problems 25-30 years ago. <br />
We aren&#39;t done yet, not because of new incoming problems. <br />
We are not done yet, because so little real progress has been made.  </p>

<p>Physics, timing, ordering, I don&#39;t see those as limitations. <br />
We know how to deal with those things. <br />
Different requirements for different networks: <br />
just implement everything, and then make stuff configurable.  </p>

<p>The problems I see with routing are: <br />
*) site multi-homing <br />
*) host multi-homing <br />
*) easy renumbering (with persistent connections during the renumbering) <br />
*) mobility  </p>

<p>To solve some of those, we should have true identifier/locator separation. <br />
Not an after-thought like LISP. <br />
But something built into the layer-3 addressing architecture. <br />
IPv6 was a chance, but we messed that chance up.  </p>

<p>You could add a few more practical issue: <br />
Like trustworthiness of BGP global routes.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, how can we do hierarchy (in IGPs, with areas), <br />
and still have all our features work across ABRs? In a scalable way. <br />
From my perspective we don&#39;t really have that yet.  </p>

<p>Another issue is configuration and troubleshooting. <br />
I think we can make improvements there (and make running a network easier).  </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Thank you for the feedback Henk. </p>

<p>While I feel the observation that the laws of physics are invariant may lead to different sense of what a &quot;solved problem is&quot;, one specific clarification I would ask is whether the following is an agreement or a disagreement:</p>

<p>&quot;But you can&#39;t have both: reduction of information and perfect information&quot;</p>

<p>It reads a little like an agreement.</p>

<p>Yes, we agree there. <br />
I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re thinking about the same details. :) But your statement was certainly correct. But not because of physics or timing or ordering. For me the main reason is: you want to summarize for scaling, but you do not want to summarize if you want to find optimal routes.</p>

<p>Many networks don&#39;t need summarization. Because scalability is not a real issue for them. But for the biggest networks (e.g. 10k+ routers in one IGP domain), we do need summarization. So those networks lose optimal routes. This is a fundamental issue that I don&#39;t see an easy solution for.</p>

<p>One aspect of a solution would if operators would design their networks with a few more constraints. But it seems the stubborn bastards don&#39;t like that. :)</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Well resources are not infinite, but that is another issue. Some people claim route processor scaling etc is a solved problem, others disagree.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll right a little more to see if I can strike some different language. Some things can be mitigated, but that does not mean they are remediated. It is in this sense I am saying somethings will never be solved.</p>

<p>Best
