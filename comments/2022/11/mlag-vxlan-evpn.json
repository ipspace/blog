This answer some questions I&#39;ve had for a long time.</p>\n\n<p>The other question I have had is how does failover speed compare when a link is lost in EVPN ESI MLAG versus LACP? And is there a control mechanism to detect a bad link that still has link status but is not forwarding like the LACP heartbeats?</p>\n",

         "html": "<p>&quot;However, the forwarding hardware limitations require anycast VTEP IP addresses&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t comment on how other implementations work, but FRR/Cumulus implementation of MAC-ECMP does not fallback on anycast.\nWhat you said about forwarding hardware requiring a single destination for a MAC is accurate, but their implementation achieves MAC-ECMP by pointing the fdb entry (mac) at single destination that is an ECMP container holding the VTEP address of each member of the remote ESI rather than pointing to a single VTEP address.</p>\n\n<p>In Linux, the ECMP container is implemented using &quot;nexthop&quot; objects (one nexthop &quot;group&quot; pointing to several nexthop entries).\nFRR populates an ES cache based on &quot;per ES&quot; Type-1 routes, which maintains a list of active VTEP addresses per ESI. One NHG is allocated in the kernel per known ESI and one NHE is allocated per active VTEP. When a MAC is learned via the remote ESI, the VXLAN driver&#39;s fdb entry points to the ID of the nexthop group (&quot;nhid&quot;) for a hash lookup to select which underlay DIP will be used.</p>\n\n<p>In Mellanox ASICs the same principle applies - an ECMP container is allocated based on the kernel NHG and it contains underlay VTEP addresses. So the hardware fdb points to the ECMP container to select a remote underlay DIP for the VXLAN tunnel (not anycast) and then the encapsulated packet goes through the route lookup based on the DIP returned by the ECMP hash lookup.</p>\n",
