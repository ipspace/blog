               "html": "Thx for the warm welcome Ivan : ) ! First, let me say that we greatly agree on LISP&#39;s and MP-TCP&#39;s (and SCTP for that matter) shortcomings.<br />\n\n<p>Re RINA, it essentially is a network model, like the OSI. Because of that, it can make use of IP as its addressing scheme no problem. So RINA and IP are not mutually exclusive.</p>\n\n<p>RINA proposes a self-similar network model, making use of one layer, and repeating it as many times as the network engineer needs, so there&#39;s no fixed number of layers. For simple networks, 3 should suffice most of the time, but as you need more, you can span more. So it&#39;s dynamic and recursive.</p>\n\n<p>Russ White is a proponent of RINA himself, and he too recognizes that OSI is missing a layer, here (in the We are missing a layer section):</p>\n\n<p>http://rule11.tech/reaction-really-need-new-internet/</p>\n\n<p>Russ misunderstood that RINA implies a fixed number of layers, and an even number, which were corrected in the comment section. </p>\n\n<p>So no, RINA doesn&#39;t propose to solve the problem by adding another layer, I hope that much is clear by now.</p>\n\n<p>Back to the example in the blog, if PI addresses are used, then multihoming is solved quite easily. A and B (the host) just do DNS to get the node address of Server, and forward their packets to ISP A or B, which then have the Server IP Block (summary) entry with interface pointing to either ISP C and D, which then end up at Server. And because TCP now uses node address, not interface address, an interface going down won&#39;t trigger session reset. That&#39;s light weight.</p>\n\n<p>Now if Provider-based address are used, then Server would have 2 node addresses. Say A makes a DNS query for Server. That would return one of the 2 node addresses, and A will pick one and pick an interface to send it to Server, either via ISP A or B -- Akamai uses this 2-level approach, hence my mentioning of them. So if the interface to either ISP A or B goes down midsession, as long as A or B knows the route to the existing node address of Server, session won&#39;t reset. Providers can negotiate that. Worst case scenarios, if they don&#39;t want to negotiate anything, session resets. But the point is, it then becomes a non-technical issue, not a fundamental one. And nowhere do I see state explosion.</p>\n\n<p>So as I see it, multihoming can be solved using the network with a 2 level addressing structure, much like the IP-MAC pair in existing network, with DNS name mapped to IP, not to MAC, so MAC change doesn&#39;t cause IP session reset. </p>\n\n<p>Plus, it has the added bonus of simplifying things, reduces the size of global RIB, and removes the tight-coupling which can lead to global synchronized collapse. </p>\n",

               "html": "<p>Ivan, the multihoming problem is a problem of delivery (2 interface addresses appear as 2 hosts to the sender, confusing the heck out of them), so it&#39;s by nature a network problem. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Do you have one TCP session or two?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>One. Like I said, there&#39;s nothing different from the way things work now except TCP session now uses node address instead of interface address.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Are they tied to link addresses or node addresses?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>They&#39;re tied to node address, so if link addresses go down, sessions won&#39;t reset as long as there&#39;s a route to the node address present somewhere in the path. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;What happens with the TCP session tied to ISP-A address when the link to ISP-A goes down?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Then the host connects to Server via ISP B, using link address to ISP B to forward packets to Server. The TCP session remains unchanged (not reset), because the node addresses remain the same. As long as ISP B has an entry to route to Server&#39;s network, packets get delivered, session won&#39;t reset. Node address is route-independent in that sense. It cares nothing about the failure or non-failure of the underlying link addresses, as long as there&#39;s still at least 1 link up that it can use to reach the destination, the session will remain on. Apart from that small detail, it&#39;s the same standard datagram delivery throughout the network. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s where the missing 1 layer comes from. So in current IP communication, we have interface IP address in the IP layer. In the 2 layer addressing, we have TCP&#39;s IP (the node address) and interface IP (link address). Only the node networks (the network entry, not individual host entries) go into the global RIB. The interface IP networks can remain private. Hope I make myself clear. </p>\n\n<p>And from that, we can see that the MAC layer is redundant because it performs the same function as the interface IP (both name/identify the interface), so it can be removed, and we retain the same number of layers for simplicity (whether it can be removed due to vested interest of vendors putting so much money into it, is another issue). </p>\n\n<p>Btw, Bela wrote in one of his comments below:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;As soon as you have multiple transmission layers, you have more than just one ID and location separation. Actually, you have a number of addresses to be mapped together, more than two. Like in an MPLS stack those multiple labels on top of each other. This is daily business for telcos for ages and they know how to do it.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Bela just repeated the hierarchical addressing model that John Day mentions in his work, in slightly different wording. Looks like Bela, through his vast experience and knowledge, has also come to see the need for hierarchical addressing for scalability. Needless to say, I agree with him 100% on that.</p>\n",

Can you show me where it&#39;s written? </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Under that scenario, host would be known only by its node address (H). Everyone between the bifurcation point (IXP) and the host needs to know that there are two paths toward the host, and what their state is. That includes ISP-A, ISP-B, and all upstream ISPs including upstream ISPs directly connected to IXP2.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Why? What&#39;s the point of summarization then? The point of addressing that&#39;s pushed forward by John Day, father of RINA, which I agree with, is an address should be route-independent. Summarization done with hierarchical addressing can even bound the number of routes in the Internet RIB. With current interface addressing BS, the global RIB is about a million routes and counting. Why does it keep rising? Because it has no boundary condition imposed. Why are network engineers called engineers when they have no understanding of boundary conditions, a fundamental aspect in engineering? </p>\n\n<p>Akamai uses 2-level DNS to implement their infrastructure; it&#39;s the same concept as hierarchical addressing, and it works for them. Now coming back to the example, ISP A and B just needs the summary routes of whatever blocks C and D possess, and on and on it goes. How should this fail to work?</p>\n\n<p>Also, in our discussion of the same topic way earlier, you pointed out that money is an incentive, no ISP can make money if hierarchical addressing is used. Fair enough. But the next question is, since money ruins a lot of things in life (IT is no exception), is money the right question to ask? When something is considered national security or national asset too valuable to fall into private hands with dubious interests, like the main grid or the oil-gas pipelines, govts will be responsible for building and managing it. Why is communication infrastructure any different? Isn&#39;t it part of national critical infrastructure these days? Why give it to private hands when they can potentially sell out to your enemies? </p>\n\n<p>Back to the global RIB, we have tight-coupling and complexity-collapse problem. Just because it hasn&#39;t happened yet (or it might have) doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t. The same way the financial idiots keep claiming that derivatives are all well and good, until they blew up in their faces and were so close to bringing down the whole financial system in 97-98 and 2008; even now the global financial system is fucked up in more ways than one; just a looming failure of Credit Suisse risks bringing down the whole shebang. Global tight-coupling complexity surely is a good thing. </p>\n\n<p>IPv6 helps make things worse, and way worse for those who know hardware. So while &#39;worst decision ever&#39; is debatable, it&#39;s pretty up there among the very bad ones. CLNP recognizes the need for hierarchy in addressing, that&#39;s what we can learn from. Should we go back to it? Hell no. IPv4 is simple, and everything simple is good. Start with this simplicity, and improve it. Funny the MPLS guys got it right by accident; they unconsciously implemented hierarchical addressing with MPLS VPN; it worked.  </p>\n\n<p>Another point that you mention somewhere is: depending on the scenarios, at worst you might end up with millions of routes in the local network, in exchange for a clean, short global RIB. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case if you implement the hierarchical addressing the right way, but let&#39;s just assume this is the case, is it that terrible? The blast radius is contained within the network. OTOH, a global RIB with millions of routes has the potential to result in massive errors that can bring down the whole or a large part of the Internet. Containment vs contagion: a clear win to me. </p>\n\n<p>Looks like John Day is demonized as an anti-IP guy. He&#39;s not. Just because he invented RINA, doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s gone nuts about it; that&#39;s what I like about him: common sense and simplicity. His views on addressing and multihoming are here for anyone with an open mind:</p>\n\n<p>https://pouzinsociety.org/sites/default/files/LocIDSplit090309.pdf</p>\n\n<p>https://psoc.i2cat.net/sites/default/files/PSOC-tutorials-naming-addressing.pdf?_ga=2.82479954.572590943.1668752621-682182543.1668752621</p>\n\n<p>https://psoc.i2cat.net/sites/default/files/PSOC-tutorial-Mobility-made-simple.pdf?_ga=2.219319261.572590943.1668752621-682182543.1668752621</p>\n\n<p>As for complaint on why his book wasn&#39;t written from an engineering perspective, well, he already stated that in the book and made clear in the title of the book for those with subtlety. He tried to propose an alternative model of networking based on his decades of experience (no, he&#39;s not just an armchair expert in academia), and that hierarchical model works well when applied to IP. </p>\n\n<p>MP-TCP and SCMP are just lipstick on a pig. A typical result of adding more complexity to solve complexity, and still failing to solve it, when the fundamentals are wrong. </p>\n",

Of course, this is specially designed for this challenge and costly.

This is now used all over the air traffic control domain for radar sensor data with up 4-times redundancy. \nSince simulcast is costly, especially in the narrowband safety critical networks, simulcast should be selective by application or traffic class on limited radio links. You would apply it only when it is absolutely needed.

And you&#39;re 100% right with &quot;a real network is a hierarchy of a large number of transport layers. &quot; Very true for mobile networks. </p>\n\n<p>That being said, I have to take side with Ivan when it comes to simplicity and simplification. The reason mobile networks have a large number of transport layers is because they have to keep propping up their network to support different name space, one on top of another, over the years. Now that we have decades of experience, we can look at that model and see if we can simplify here and there, to clean it up and optimize the good bits. Let&#39;s face it: having more parts (more complex) is never a good things, and it&#39;s a nightmare if something goes wrong; anyone who operates complex systems can attest to that.</p>\n\n<p>I have no doubt LISP can work on smaller scale with optimization and things like path liveless problems is not such a big deal in those networks. Scale matters (a corollary of boundary condition), so things that can&#39;t work on a large scale, like OpenFlow for example, can be terrrific solutions at smaller ones. There&#39;s no one-size-fit-all (again, you&#39;re spot on with that). I think what Ivan pointed out in this case, is how LISP fares at the global Internet scale, and last time you already commented that you never intended for LISP to be a solution for Internet routing, IIRC.</p>\n\n<p>The same can be said for MP-TCP and SCTP.

Pointing out their fundamental problems is not the same as saying &quot;let&#39;s trash those into the dustbin&quot;. Far from it ;) .

         "html": "<p>I am just using MP-TCP for my Internet connection. As millions and millions of users. But not at the application layers, rather as an underlay transmission solution. What IP guys tend to forget, that a real network is a hierarchy of a large number of transport layers. Not the OSI model. That has nothing to do with real wide area networks. People should study the ITU-T G.800 series. That is where real networks are properly modeled. We have a cultural problem here, denial of telco know-how...</p>\n\n<p>As soon as you have multiple transmission layers, you have more than just one ID and location separation. Actually, you have a number of addresses to be mapped together, more than two. Like in an MPLS stack those multiple labels on top of each other. This is daily business for telcos for ages and they know how to do it.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand telcos are using SCTP for ages inside their infrastructure. Because they could use software specifically designed for SCTP, they do not need backward compatibility to socket APIs. And it works well for high-availability and &quot;multi-homing&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>This multi-homing is a problem only if you are limited to old enterprise feature sets on your devices. It is also not taught in most courses how to design high-availability networks... :-)</p>\n\n<p>In many cases, you cannot change your end systems, they are not able to support multi-homing directly, and then you shift the problem to the network if feasible. If you put a multiple attached proxy in front of such a legacy device, then you can achieve a very good availability, since the local link, that is a single point of failure, might be good enough in reliability. Virtual IP addresses are also used quite successfully in such scenarios. </p>\n\n<p>Another simple solution used in safety critical networks is to use multiple end user devices with the same functionality. Then if you have an operational issues, you just move to the next workstation. This is the ultimate high-availability, but of course with some cost.</p>\n\n<p>I am a big fan of the &quot;design to cost&quot; and a risk management approach in engineering. For each cost level you might need different architectures. There is no single solution for everything. We need diversity as well. This also fundamental for safety. It is needed from the business perspective for leveraging you negotiation opportunities...</p>\n",
