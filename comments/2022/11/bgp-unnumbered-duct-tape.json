Prior to nexthop groups the linux kernel would not accept a v6 nexthop for a v4 prefix.  So the routes were entered with a 169.254.0.1 &lt;iif&gt; as the actual nexthop.  The code to add this entry just has not gotten removed yet, since they have not done any current harm.  Additionally they are there for when the operator enters the command to turn off nexthop groups for installation into the linux kernel.</p>\n",
