            <div class="comment-content"><p>I work on large scale workload, migration projects regularly migrating systems from a legacy data center to an end state data center. Almost every single project I have to tell the customers why I won&#39;t agree to a design that requires permanent layer 2 stretching. Some customers can be very persistent, and besides listing all the problems that can occur with permanent layer 2 extensions, I just also casually remind them that Amazon won&#39;t let you do it either, not even in between their own two data centers, let alone with your legacy data center ( as subnets are limited within and AZ). Fun stuff! &#x1F601;</p>
