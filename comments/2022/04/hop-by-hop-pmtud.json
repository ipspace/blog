Once that level of control exists, the issues with EHs can be made to disappear - the network can choose to buy equipment that supports EH processing they require and can enable it.</p>\n\n<p>The IETF are really designing protocols for two scenarios - over the public, network of networks called the Internet, and within a single administration network (usually one of the networks of networks in the Internet). Some things can&#39;t be assumed to work reliably over the Internet (e.g. PMTUD, EHs), yet can be made to work within a single network.</p>\n",
