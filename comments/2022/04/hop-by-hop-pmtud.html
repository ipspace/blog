            <div class="comment-content"><p>The thing Geoff hasn&#39;t noticed in that draft is that (a) it is experimental, and (b) it isn&#39;t expected to be used across the Internet - the design goal is within a single network, such as a Data Centre network.</p>

<p>Within a single network you have a single administration that control the network infrastructure. Once that level of control exists, the issues with EHs can be made to disappear - the network can choose to buy equipment that supports EH processing they require and can enable it.</p>

<p>The IETF are really designing protocols for two scenarios - over the public, network of networks called the Internet, and within a single administration network (usually one of the networks of networks in the Internet). Some things can&#39;t be assumed to work reliably over the Internet (e.g. PMTUD, EHs), yet can be made to work within a single network.</p>
