            <div class="comment-content"><p>Different vendor defaults can be surprising, indeed.</p>

<p>Many vendors use a default different from the Arista EOS default described above. Some allow to configure similar behavior:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On Cisco IOS-XR there is the command <code>ibgp policy out enforce-modifications</code> to get the behavior you described for Arista EOS above.</p></li>
<li><p>On Cisco IOS the <code>neighbor &amp;lt;IP&amp;gt; internal-vpn-client</code> command enables this for iBGP PE&lt;---&gt;CE connections.</p></li>
<li><p>Huawei VRP has the configuration command <code>reflect change-path-attribute</code> to enable changing path attribute of reflected routes via policy.</p></li>
</ul>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>To be fair, &#39;nexthop-self&#39; isn&#39;t the default behavior when advertising towards the RR client, if you notice the config:
     neighbor 10.0.0.2 next-hop-self
for the RR client 10.0.0.2. If you don&#39;t configure that, it will be nexthop-unchanged, which would be compliant to the &#39;SHOULD&#39; behavior. </p>

<p>So in a way, the default behavior difference here is really whether a config would take its face value, or a strict higher layer would always forbid it, by default. </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Yeah, you could say that I asked for it ;)</p>

<p>I definitely found the behavior unexpected, more so as other platforms with very similar syntax behave in a different way. Will reword it a bit (give me a few days).</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I&#39;ve also found that when doing an eBGP Route Server setup across a shared subnet (Third Party Next Hop), Arista changes the next hop to self while Cisco doesn&#39;t. To make it worse, adding next-hop-unchanged didn&#39;t work (though the command took), you needed to set it via a route-map. Even worse, routes not learned over the shared interconnect were swept up in this, and dropped because:</p>

<p>RFC-4271 section-5.1.3 Clause 2 of section 5.1.3: 
      2) When sending a message to an external peer, X, and the peer is
         one IP hop away from the speaker:</p>

<pre><code>     - Otherwise, if the route being announced was learned from an
       external peer, the speaker can use an IP address of any
       adjacent router (known from the received NEXT_HOP attribute)
       that the speaker itself uses for local route calculation in
       the NEXT_HOP attribute, provided that peer X shares a common
       subnet with this address.  This is a second form of &amp;quot;third
       party&amp;quot; NEXT_HOP attribute.

     - Otherwise, if the external peer to which the route is being
       advertised shares a common subnet with one of the interfaces
       of the announcing BGP speaker, the speaker MAY use the IP
       address associated with such an interface in the NEXT_HOP
       attribute.  This is known as a &amp;quot;first party&amp;quot; NEXT_HOP
       attribute.
</code></pre>

<p><em>*</em>         - By default (if none of the above conditions apply), the BGP
           speaker SHOULD use the IP address of the interface that the
           speaker uses to establish the BGP connection to peer X in the
           NEXT_HOP attribute.</p>

<p>sh ip bgp nei x.x.x.x showed:
    Nexthop invalid for single hop eBGP: 1</p>

<p>Making the peering eBGP multihop, even though its 1 hop away, allowed the route in, per another part of the same RFC:
      3) When sending a message to an external peer X, and the peer is
         multiple IP hops away from the speaker (aka &quot;multihop EBGP&quot;):</p>

<pre><code>     - The speaker MAY be configured to propagate the NEXT_HOP
       attribute.  In this case, when advertising a route that the
       speaker learned from one of its peers, the NEXT_HOP attribute
       of the advertised route is exactly the same as the NEXT_HOP
       attribute of the learned route (the speaker does not modify
       the NEXT_HOP attribute).
