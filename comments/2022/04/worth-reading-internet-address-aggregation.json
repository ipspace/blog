Somehow it doesn&#39;t offer much of an insight except from stating the problems that people have already known: the routing and address explosion. He didn&#39;t qualify what he meant by achieve: &quot;Somehow, we&rsquo;ve achieved this without regional aggregation&quot;, so that doesn&#39;t mean much. </p>\n\n<p>Most of all, since John Day the originator of RINA -- IMO a very knowledgeable, down to earth and straightforward person who knows more about Networking than any man alive -- is still around, I&#39;d say maybe someone can contact him directly and ask him this specific problem and how he would detail a solution as an engineering topic. He&#39;s already provided the part of the answer in chapter 8 of his book, Patterns in Network Architecture: A Return to Fundamentals, on why and a little bit of how, topologically-protected addressing can address provider&#39;s sharing issues -- now I&#39;m not sure if Geoff has read it -- but surely people who seek a deeper answer rather than just mindlessly consume dogma can ask him questions if they&#39;re genuinely interested in Networking problems.</p>\n",
