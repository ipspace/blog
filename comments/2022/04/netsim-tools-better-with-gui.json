Installed Multipass, Created an netlab Ubuntu instance and Created a sample 2 node lab etc...and I have seen this blog post and thought of trying it... </p>\n\n<p>So I added those two lines and started a lab. The output says it is success and printed the URL and when I tried to access it, I was not able to... started troubleshooting... The docker image of &quot;netreplica/graphite&quot; is showing... But when I try to run that docker image for testing, it gave me the following output &quot;WARNING: The requested image&#39;s platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested&quot; </p>\n\n<p>So is there any way to make this graphite works for the arm64 architecture... Sorry... I don&#39;t know any programming etc and I am trying to learn this netlab. So if any naive or stupid questions if I have asked, please forgive and guide me or just give me a clue and I will try to go along that way</p>\n\n<p>TIA</p>\n\n<p>PAM</p>\n",
