<p>For those not directly involved in the market, it is difficult to determine when a given technology is not &quot;sexy&quot; anymore. Some technologies are mature and still alive, some of them are legacy technologies that only persist in niche domains, and some others never flourished or have been completely superseded by another technology. However, most of them are thoroughly described in the textbooks and/or the Internet (The <em>Internet</em> is dark and full of terrors), to the very last header bit, but without any actual information about their fate or demise.</p>

<p>There are many other technologies (which, in many cases, are still taught at Universities, <em>because books</em>) in which similar posts would be very appreciated. For example, a quick brainstorming going back many years:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When was X.25 official declared dead? Note that the wikipedia claims that it is <em>still</em> in use in parts of the world. What about FR? ATM? ...</p></li>
<li><p>You mention MPLS/VPN and SDWAN, what about other technologies? Is people still using IPSec/TLS tunnels? DMVPN? FlexVPN? ...</p></li>
<li><p>Are FabricPath, TRILL or SPB still alive, or has everyone moved to VXLAN? Are they worth studying?</p></li>
<li><p>Regarding storage, is Fibre Channel still a thing in 2022, or most people employ SATA over Ethernet and NVMe over fabrics? What about SAS drives, do they still make sense other than in legacy arrays, or has their segment been completely hogged by NVMe SSDs? What about FCoE? Note that FCoE is still part of Cisco&#39;s certifications, but I have seen many posts declaring it dead 7-8 years ago. </p></li>
<li><p>...</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I know that some information can be obtained from market analysis firms (such as IDC) and that you have posts about some of the mentioned technologies. My point is not so much to ask specifically about each of them, but rather to highlight the lack of available up-to-date reliable information about the status of many technologies.</p>
