Mainly, I am irritated by &quot;gurus&quot; who preach about passing certification examinations in a month with no prior experience and other such rubbish. Furthermore, video content from well-known learning organizations is so poor that even some of the most popular learning companies embrace the &quot;quantity over quality&quot; strategy. The content they post is rubbish and is not worth the monthly fees they charge.</p>\n",

Forget about reading, even watching a 45&#39; documentary is too much for some(many) people. That&#39;s why I&#39;m very pessimistic about science and technology these days. It&#39;s all flash and no substance mostly, with collapsing complexity everywhere you look. A civilization of little character and low spirit, have no WILL to work on the hard problems. Period. Ancient Greeks and Samurai Spirits should be made mandatory topics in schools if we want things to change. </p>\n\n<p>Didn&#39;t you notice already, that the amount of comment on your blog has reduced considerably in the past few years, compared to say, 2017 and before that? That too, is a sign of the times. </p>\n\n<p>But like you said, people who have a passion for writing should still publish, as their loyal readers will still read their content, and it&#39;s these people that count (another application of Sturgeon Law). Plus, above all, they should write for themselves, because that&#39;s what they want, and that&#39;s what they are. If you&#39;ve put a lot of hard work and thought in a blog/article, you don&#39;t need any external validation to know that you have produced something of value. The work will speak for itself.</p>\n\n<p>I have some disagreements with you here and there on the technical aspects, but I always greatly respect your old-school work ethics and conscience, and this one is definitely on-point on all aspects. It applies equally in and out of IT. </p>\n",

We have this new thing called SDN. Customers want to buy it, VCs want to pour money into it&quot;. So I started googling for &quot;SDN&quot;. In those days, SDN still meant: &quot;OpenFlow&quot;. I read about OpenFlow. I was wondering: &quot;What am I missing here? This can&#39;t be serious? This will never work?&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I ran into your blog, Ivan. One day there was a post that said: &quot;OpenFlow is just a forwarding-table download-protocol&quot;. That answered all my questions. Yes, they were serious. No, I wasn&#39;t missing anything. And indeed, it never worked.</p>\n\n<p>What I appreciate most about this blog is the honest opinions and direct descriptions. No wish to obfuscate things. No tendency to always use friendly words. Not afraid to say that something is wrong or useless in the real world. This saves us so much time, to not have to wade through marketing bullshit.</p>\n",

I like the &quot;don&#39;t give up&quot; section which reminds us again why we write.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing wrong with writing vs. video content but I could not comment on which one is better. It just has a different engagement model. One is for your eyes only, and the other is for your eyes and ears. Oh, by the way, the style matters a lot to keep the audience engaged (i.e. RFC 2328 or RFC 1925).  </p>\n",
