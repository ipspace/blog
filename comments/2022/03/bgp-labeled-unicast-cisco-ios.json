               "html": "<p>Been there, done that.\nIndeed interop can be tricky: IOS, IOS-XE, IOS-XR, add other vendors in the mix. It can also change between software versions! Thus, lab validation required. I remember outages caused by prefixes stuck on PE, which were not withdrawn correctly.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, XR did not allow having both AF configured on the same neighbor. While it worked, you had a syslog telling you this was not supported (and this could be fine if you 100% knew what you were doing, i.e controlled prefix filtering and label allocation). The best practice was to have 2 BGP sessions: 1 for U, 1 for LU. But for major SP with thousands of PEs, it means new loopbacks to provision (and advertise).</p>\n\n<p>This behavior was changed in XR 6.2.3 I believe: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr9000/software/asr9k-r7-4/routing/configuration/guide/b-routing-cg-asr9000-74x/implementing-BGP.html</p>\n\n<p>&quot;For default VRF, starting from Cisco IOS XR Software Release 6.2.x, both IPv4 Unicast and IPv4 Labeled-unicast address families are supported under the same neighbor&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And this triggered additional problems which were mitigated with... BGP knobs!\nI know Ivan is a fan of weird BGP knobs, so here you are:</p>\n\n<p>update in merge safi unicast labeled-unicast: I think this one was used to withdraw both entries, independently which SAFI we received the BGP withdraw. Introduced in 6.6.x I believe. It was hidden. It was later renamed to &quot;update in labeled-unicast equivalent&quot; in 7.1.1</p>\n\n<p>advertise local-labeled-route safi-unicast disable: disable the advertisement of a route with a local label to peers on the unicast SAFI</p>\n\n<p>Both of them are now documented: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr9000/software/asr9k-r7-4/routing/command/reference/b-routing-cr-asr9000-74x/bgp-commands.html</p>\n\n<p>Voila. This is what I remember from a 2018 escalation. And you now have material to write another post ;-)\nFred</p>\n",

         "html": "<p>Having one RIB for labeled and unlabeled unicast on IOS has caused weird interop problem in the field. Especially since most other implementations (even Cisco IOS-XR) have different RIB and negotiate labeled and unlabeled SAFI separately.</p>\n\n<p>Take for example 6PE - remote PE expects an update with :FFFF: nexthop + MPLS label. Unlabeled IPv6 SAFI is not used between PE so it will probably not be negotiated. IOS code has some checks which tell whether to attach label or not, depending on nexthop format, whether nexthop was changed etc. Sometimes it might decide to send an unlabeled update over a labeled unicast session.</p>\n\n<p>It can get even worse if the peer is pre-RFC7606, so it might just drop the BGP session with all AF because of this.</p>\n",
