               "html": "So you are telling us: &quot;The 2 main people from cisco east-coast told me that the cisco west-coast people messed it up&quot;? Yeah, right.<br />\n\n<p>(Besides, there was only one good programmer in Boston: Dan Tappan. Everybody else there was an &quot;architect&quot;. I don&#39;t believe east-coast would have done better.</p>\n\n<p>The issue is much simpler. UUnet and iMCI were designing their new backbones with routers at the edge, and all Fore ATM switches in the middle. That was a $100M market that cisco was losing out on. At the same time, Ipsilon came with their proprietary technology with some flow-based, connection-oriented, doing IP-packet switching over ATM  circuits. Lots of people at ISPs (and even at the IETF) loved the idea of having circuits. Old telephone people never change.</p>\n\n<p>So Yakhov came with MPLS (first called tag-switching). It was basically the idea of using connections (LSPs) to compete with Fore and Ipsilon. And nobody thought of doing &quot;connectionless labels&quot;. That is how we ended up with LDP and TE-RSVP. Because the people who made the purchasing decisions, and the VCs that invested in new technology, all wanted connection-oriented technology. And then BGP-MPLS-VPNs came. Another crappy idea. But it allowed ISPs to &quot;sell a managed service&quot;. Another reason why ISPs wanted MPLS.</p>\n\n<p>Yakhov once told me that they seriously thought about using the existing source-routing IP-header option. They decided to not use it, because IP-options had a bad rep. If have often thought: &quot;I wish they had done TE via IP-source-routing&quot;. I guess we got it after all, we just call it SRv6 now. :)</p>\n\n<p>The simple fact is, when MPLS came about, nobody thought of doing &quot;connectionless labels&quot;. I guess the connection-oriented mind-set was still active in many people.</p>\n",

         "html": "<p>In 2014 when I did the first prototype implementation of MPLS-SR node labels, I was stunned that just with an incremental add of 500 Lines of code to the vanilla ipv4/ipv6 IS-IS codebase I got full any-to-any connectivity, no sync issues, no targeted sessions for R-LFA .... essentially labeled transport comes for free. Later I did ask George Swallow and Yakov Rekhter (The original MPLS design team) &quot;Why did you not do this right from the start ?&quot; and the answer was not pretty: &quot;IGPs have been done in San Jose and the MPLS design team was mostly located in the Boxborough office. At the time there was lots of stability issues with IGPs and management has asked us not to touch any IGP code&quot;</p>\n",

         "html": "<p>Hi Minh,</p>\n\n<p>&gt; I always value your thoughts</p>\n\n<p>Thanks. But maybe you shouldn&#39;t. :) I am just another idiot with an opinion. I have been out of the industry for a long time (over a decade). And my practical knowledge about today&#39;s real networks is limited. (Hopefully that&#39;ll change in the next 2 years).</p>\n\n<p>&gt; why</p>\n\n<p>Because I think BGP-MPLS-VPNs are over-complicated. And you don&#39;t get enough return for that extra complexity. Note, I think that about a lot of technologies. I like simple, I like elegant. And I think vendors should focus on optimizing their implementations. In stead of throwing in new features and new protocol extensions. Same thing about providers: imho they should focus on simplifying their designs, and getting rid of obscure features, in stead of asking for more.</p>\n\n<p>(Ivan likes to complain about vendors introducing more technological complexity. But imho the providers are worse. They ask for these knobs and stuff. And once it is in, you can never take it out. And once one vendors does it, all vendors need to implement it. You wouldn&#39;t believe the nonsense I&#39;ve heard some ISPs ask for).</p>\n\n<p>If I ever get to do job-interviews again (not as an applicant, I&#39;m staying put), one of my questions will be: &quot;what is your favorite rule from rfc1925&quot;. FYI, mine is rule 12.</p>\n\n<p>Another factor related to BGP-MPLS-VPNs is that I don&#39;t like the basic design. The Internet became a success because of a number of design principles. One is: &quot;dumb network, smart hosts&quot;. We, as an industry, sometimes forget about those basic principles. BGP-MPLS-VPNs are the opposite of this. I understand why, because if gives an opportunity for ISPs to sell a service. But imho, large VPNs should be done by the customers themselves, on their equipment. Like DMVPNs and other SD-WAN technologies.</p>\n",
