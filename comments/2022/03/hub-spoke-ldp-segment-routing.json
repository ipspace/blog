Later I did ask George Swallow and Yakov Rekhter (The original MPLS design team) &quot;Why did you not do this right from the start ?&quot; and the answer was not pretty: &quot;IGPs have been done in San Jose and the MPLS design team was mostly located in the Boxborough office. At the time there was lots of stability issues with IGPs and management has asked us not to touch any IGP code&quot;</p>\n",
