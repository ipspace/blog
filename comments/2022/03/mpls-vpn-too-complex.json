To my understanding it doesn&#39;t really bring much to the table except maybe a somewhat templated design on how to sell certain types of edge handoffs between the SP and customer.</p>\n\n<p>I take it by offloading the MPLS L(2|3)VPNs to the provider, and the provider handing off using Carrier Ethernet that it&#39;s easier to have a standardized set of interface configurations?</p>\n",
