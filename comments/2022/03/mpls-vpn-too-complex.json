To my understanding it doesn&#39;t really bring much to the table except maybe a somewhat templated design on how to sell certain types of edge handoffs between the SP and customer.</p>\n\n<p>I take it by offloading the MPLS L(2|3)VPNs to the provider, and the provider handing off using Carrier Ethernet that it&#39;s easier to have a standardized set of interface configurations?</p>\n",

If I may borrow the newest meme fad: My brothers in Christ, We wanted these features. And now it&rsquo;s too complex? Maybe it&rsquo;s too complex because We lacked the agency and fortitude to reject unreasonable business demands. We still do, stretched L2 anyone? </p>\n",
