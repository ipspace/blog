            <div class="comment-content"><p>In 2014 when I did the first prototype implementation of MPLS-SR node labels, I was stunned that just with an incremental add of 500 Lines of code to the vanilla ipv4/ipv6 IS-IS codebase I got full any-to-any connectivity, no sync issues, no targeted sessions for R-LFA .... essentially labeled transport comes for free. Later I did ask George Swallow and Yakov Rekhter (The original MPLS design team) &quot;Why did you not do this right from the start ?&quot; and the answer was not pretty: &quot;IGPs have been done in San Jose and the MPLS design team was mostly located in the Boxborough office. At the time there was lots of stability issues with IGPs and management has asked us not to touch any IGP code&quot;</p>
