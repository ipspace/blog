Despite having access to a DNA centre and its SDA deployment tools, I am leaning towards BGP EVPN. It seems they essentially achieve the same thing, and we have existing BGP expertise in the operational support teams. This makes the BGP based control plane a much easier sell. The fact that the configuration can be built and applied by either direct CLI or tools like ansible are seen as desirable vs trusting what DNAC is deploying.</p>\n",
