         "html": "<p>The single IOS process in IOS XE is not the same as the old IOS. This is only a subset, since all data plane forwarding functions are implemented separately with dedicated CPU cores in ISR 4000, but with ASICs in ASR900, Cat9000 or Cat8000. The original all-software IOS does not support such an architecture. A lot of things in IOS XE are also platform specific. </p>\n\n<p>Because of that, an IOS XE simulation using a VM might be far away from real behavior. Whenever you have a platform specific limitation, optimization, bugs, etc. the simulation would not be the same as the real device.</p>\n\n<p>Simulation is a good starting point, but not a proper validation even for you functionality. Real hardware might give you surprises...</p>\n",
