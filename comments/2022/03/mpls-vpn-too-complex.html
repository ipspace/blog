            <div class="comment-content"><p>&gt; Carrier Ethernet became a viable alternative, and as much as it hurts me, I&rsquo;m usually recommending customer-managed routers attached to Carrier Ethernet as a better (and safer) alternative to MPLS/VPN</p>

<p>If I may ask, how did Carrier Ethernet become a viable alternative that obsoleted L(2|3)VPNs? To my understanding it doesn&#39;t really bring much to the table except maybe a somewhat templated design on how to sell certain types of edge handoffs between the SP and customer.</p>

<p>I take it by offloading the MPLS L(2|3)VPNs to the provider, and the provider handing off using Carrier Ethernet that it&#39;s easier to have a standardized set of interface configurations?</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Carrier Ethernet is L2VPN and might utilize MPLS as the transport layer. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_Ethernet</p>

<p>As for the <em>ease of consuming</em> L2VPN versus L3VPN services (from the end-user perspective): I covered that in details in the <em>Choose the Optimal VPN Service</em> webinar and in the January 2022 Design Clinic. There might be a blog post or two covering that topic as well. </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>This is akin to people complaining at the IRS about how the US tax code is too darn complex (features). Manufacturers (IRS) didn&rsquo;t dream up this complexity for fun. If I may borrow the newest meme fad: My brothers in Christ, We wanted these features. And now it&rsquo;s too complex? Maybe it&rsquo;s too complex because We lacked the agency and fortitude to reject unreasonable business demands. We still do, stretched L2 anyone? </p>
