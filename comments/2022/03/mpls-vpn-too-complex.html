            <div class="comment-content"><p>&gt; Carrier Ethernet became a viable alternative, and as much as it hurts me, I&rsquo;m usually recommending customer-managed routers attached to Carrier Ethernet as a better (and safer) alternative to MPLS/VPN</p>

<p>If I may ask, how did Carrier Ethernet become a viable alternative that obsoleted L(2|3)VPNs? To my understanding it doesn&#39;t really bring much to the table except maybe a somewhat templated design on how to sell certain types of edge handoffs between the SP and customer.</p>

<p>I take it by offloading the MPLS L(2|3)VPNs to the provider, and the provider handing off using Carrier Ethernet that it&#39;s easier to have a standardized set of interface configurations?</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Carrier Ethernet is L2VPN and might utilize MPLS as the transport layer. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_Ethernet</p>

<p>As for the <em>ease of consuming</em> L2VPN versus L3VPN services (from the end-user perspective): I covered that in details in the <em>Choose the Optimal VPN Service</em> webinar and in the January 2022 Design Clinic. There might be a blog post or two covering that topic as well. </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>It is not just about consuming. The provisioning by the service provider becomes much simpler with Carrier Ethernet. It can be also fully automated, even over a long chain of multiple service providers. 
While the prices in a competitive situation cannot cover the cost of complex provisioning schemes. So Carrier Ethernet wins by the simple cost effectiveness reasons. </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Carrier Ethernet reduces complexity for the customer, reliance on a specific carrier and cost. </p>

<p>In terms of security, it comes with less overhead and complexity, if the primary objective is to encrypt the entire IP packet and to have full integrity protection and line-rate DoS resistance (in case you don&#39;t use MACsec). If you want to have high assurance security, there are products that also offer the tunneling of the Ethernet-header and advanced traffic flow security. Some of the solutions are also quantum-safe right out of the box (including multipoint support) and a number of solutions offer group key systems for meshed-configurations. There are also solutions, that support multi-tenant scenarios over single and multiple ports. Not with MACsec, though, not even with NSA Type 1 devices.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>This is akin to people complaining at the IRS about how the US tax code is too darn complex (features). Manufacturers (IRS) didn&rsquo;t dream up this complexity for fun. If I may borrow the newest meme fad: My brothers in Christ, We wanted these features. And now it&rsquo;s too complex? Maybe it&rsquo;s too complex because We lacked the agency and fortitude to reject unreasonable business demands. We still do, stretched L2 anyone? </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>&gt; people complaining</p>

<p>Is this directed to me? This is not a complaint, this is just my opinion. As I wrote in my original reply, &quot;I am just another idiot with an opinion&quot;.</p>

<p>&gt; Manufacturers didn&rsquo;t dream up this complexity for fun.</p>

<p>FYI, I&#39;ve spent half of my career working for vendors. So I am not complaining about manufacturers. (The other half was a very long sabbatical). The last network that I had to maintain had 4 transparent bridges, and 1 AGS. That was more than 3 decades ago.</p>

<p>The rise and deployment of MPLS was during my long sabbatical. When I came back, MPLS had just been declared dead, and SR was on the rise. I have perfect timing. :)</p>

<p>About complexity. I like simple. I really like simple. I happen to be an author of RFC3784 (ISIS extensions for TE). At the time (1998-1999) I thought to myself: &quot;I hardly understand how this stuff is supposed to work myself. And I am a co-author of this draft. How are operators going to design, deploy and troubleshoot this?&quot;</p>

<p>During the next years (during my sabbatical) I saw that people were writing books about MPLS, MPLS-RSPV-TE and BGP-MPLS-VPNs. There were blog-post. New features and extensions in the IETF. Clearly I was wrong. MPLS-RSVP-TE was being deployed and was a success.</p>

<p>However, last year I watched a presentation by Clarence Filsfils about SR and TE. Clarence said: &quot;2.5% of ISPs use(d) MPLS-RSVP-TE. 0% of enterprises use MPLS-RSVP-TE&quot;. So maybe my original thought wasn&#39;t so wrong after all. :)</p>

Extreme SPB-M is easy and can run L2 L3 &amp; MC.
Normally that run on single IS-IS but now it can multi area.</p>

<p>On service provider arena</p>

<p>MPLS SR MPLS with ISIS ?</p>

            <div class="comment-content">In the age of such brilliancy on Enterprises network solutions such as :<br />

<ul>
<li>using nat to route traffic because dynamic routing is to hard to grasp and static routing too cumbersome
-Firewalls on about any network segment because of reasons</li>
</ul>

<p>simple concepts like a vrf light are already very difficult to grasp to some IT teams so a basic MPLS design witch is a great concept is viewed as very complex/expensive solution.</p>

<p>Some providers in Europe still find success selling mpls to end customers as a vpn solution and it beats the currently popular automated ipsec tunneling solutions aka sd-something in most customer requirements, the cost is where it is usually lacking, however even in this domain it can be cost effective at scale if well design/managed.</p>
