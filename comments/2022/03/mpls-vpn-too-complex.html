            <div class="comment-content"><p>&gt; Carrier Ethernet became a viable alternative, and as much as it hurts me, I&rsquo;m usually recommending customer-managed routers attached to Carrier Ethernet as a better (and safer) alternative to MPLS/VPN</p>

<p>If I may ask, how did Carrier Ethernet become a viable alternative that obsoleted L(2|3)VPNs? To my understanding it doesn&#39;t really bring much to the table except maybe a somewhat templated design on how to sell certain types of edge handoffs between the SP and customer.</p>

<p>I take it by offloading the MPLS L(2|3)VPNs to the provider, and the provider handing off using Carrier Ethernet that it&#39;s easier to have a standardized set of interface configurations?</p>
