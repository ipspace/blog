For example I have devices connected to a bridge (currently macvlan) could I replace that with a vxlan to communicate to another containerlab host machine? I probably have to set the vxlans manually as I use only the netlab create command due to the big topo which is faster without ansible.\nBut could netlab do that or only between device to another device?</p>\n\n<p>So when I do it manually I probably would just use the bridge all those devices are connected to as master for my vxlan?</p>\n",
