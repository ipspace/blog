            <div class="comment-content"><p>&gt;  I am to blame for trying to juggle a bunch of square pegs when the tool supports a single round hole.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t your fault, NCLU really should handle that case, but sometimes it is better to ship something that is useful but not 100% right.</p>

<p>&gt; you&rsquo;re forced to use the NVIDIA User Experience</p>

<p>oh no</p>

<p>&gt; The Mellanox/NVIDIA acquisition transformed a promising Linux-based operating system running on a dozen brands of whitebox and britebox into yet another NOS running on niche hardware.</p>

<p>I am still optimistic about the kernel&#39;s switchdev driver that Cumulus was partially responsible for. The Mellanox Spectrum switchdev driver is fantastic, and the Sparx-5 driver is extremely promising.</p>

<p>Sadly the Marvell Prestera driver doesn&#39;t actually drive their ASIC, but instead is an RPC proxy to an extra CPU that doesn&#39;t exist on 99% of Prestera switches. Oh well.</p>

<p>If I still had my youthful energy, I would write a SwitchDevInUserSpace driver (SDUSE?) and wire it up to the Open Source* Broadcom SDK:

<li>I have not had a proper IP lawyer review their license, but it looks pretty MIT/BSDesque to me.</li>
