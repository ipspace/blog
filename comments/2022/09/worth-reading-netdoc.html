<p>However, just a note... these types of tools are rarely useful in production environments and produce ridiculously crowded diagrams that are impossible for anyone to understand. </p>

<p>The philosophy of netbox was to be a &quot;source of truth&quot; tool and was essentially an easy way to manually document your network through intuitive menus and pages. The same needs to be done for network diagramming - do you really need to see every single device on the network in a diagram...probably not. On and &quot;Up/Down&quot; dashboard, sure  </p>

<p>In my view, as long as the network topology engineering methodology is well documented, and simple to understand with deployment categories or usecases, etc....that is all you need with an accompanying network documentation tool such as netbox.  </p>
