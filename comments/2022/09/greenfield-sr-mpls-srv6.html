            <div class="comment-content"><p>I like SR-MPLS because it doesn&rsquo;t switch labels on every hop, (assuming uniformly configured node SIDs) which makes debugging easier.</p>

<p>I used to think SRv6 was great, until I started looking at what was needed to prevent 3rd parties from sending traffic across weird paths in my network. Then I realised that having a separate layer like MPLS has its benefits :)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get traffic to VMs, but it&rsquo;s also much harder for (customer?) VMs to mess with my network&hellip;</p>
