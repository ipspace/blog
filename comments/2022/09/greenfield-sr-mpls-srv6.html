            <div class="comment-content"><p>I like SR-MPLS because it doesn&rsquo;t switch labels on every hop, (assuming uniformly configured node SIDs) which makes debugging easier.</p>

<p>I used to think SRv6 was great, until I started looking at what was needed to prevent 3rd parties from sending traffic across weird paths in my network. Then I realised that having a separate layer like MPLS has its benefits :)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get traffic to VMs, but it&rsquo;s also much harder for (customer?) VMs to mess with my network&hellip;</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Many thanks for such an interesting post.</p>

<p>Do you think vendors current supported label max stack might be an issue when trying to route a packet from source using Adj-SIDs on relatively big sized (and meshed) cores? Many seem to be proposing to use SRv6 to overcome this...</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>The problem with SR-MPLS is that it does not play well with commodity hardware and ECMP. The label stack depth renders many commodity ASIC&#39;s unable to make a ECMP decision to send the flow on. Entropy labels doesn&#39;t really help since each takes two-labels and, on some commodity hardware, would require one every 2 SR labels. So the solution is great if you want to continue to purchase big iron ASIC&#39;s for the middle of your network.</p>

<p>SRv6 offsets this via the entropy field. Allowing the ingress point to set a entropy value which mid-points in the network can hash on.</p>

<p>Found a document claiming &quot;25 hardware implementations&quot;, but never found a corresponding list with 25 entries (unless it&#39;s the Jericho chipset, which one could hardly call &quot;commodity&quot;).</p>
