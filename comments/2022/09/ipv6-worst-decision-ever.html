            <div class="comment-content"><p>Maybe the worst the decision was to allocate public IPv4 address space while already being aware of IPv4 address depletion. Now leaving the whole world with a readdressing (and IPv4-to-IPv6-conversion) or dual stack challenge for ever. This never ending challenge also costs a lot. I don&#39;t know if you can compensate that cost with cheap shared medium solutions. 
From a network perspective I prefer routing (small layer 2 domains) over bridging/switching/Ethernet/STP (large layer 2 domains). Whether it&#39;s CLNP or IPv6 is a matter of taste (or it depends which camp you belong).</p>
