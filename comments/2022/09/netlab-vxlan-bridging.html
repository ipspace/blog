            <div class="comment-content"><p>Would this also work on bridges. For example I have devices connected to a bridge (currently macvlan) could I replace that with a vxlan to communicate to another containerlab host machine? I probably have to set the vxlans manually as I use only the netlab create command due to the big topo which is faster without ansible.
But could netlab do that or only between device to another device?</p>

<p>So when I do it manually I probably would just use the bridge all those devices are connected to as master for my vxlan?</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>There&#39;s nothing in <em>netlab</em> (yet) that would set up that connectivity automatically, and I never tried to use a macvlan device off a bridge, but it looks like that works for you, in which case build the VXLAN connectivity between those bridges and you&#39;re done (but you&#39;ll have to do it yourself).</p>

<p>You could also start the (local part) of the lab in a way that the external-facing links are using Linux bridges (having three nodes attached to a link will do the trick), and then create VXLAN interface(s) and attach them to those bridges.</p>

<p>In any case, plenty of &quot;manual&quot; work until we get https://github.com/ipspace/netlab/issues/1791 implemented</p>
