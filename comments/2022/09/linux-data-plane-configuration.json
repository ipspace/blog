I managed to put together some unit templates that puts FRR and a set of interfaces into their own network namespace. I like it this way because no other services run in the same namespace unless I configure them to explicitly do so (with a other template). I put it up on GH so others can benefit: https://github.com/brotherdust/systemd-netns-frr</p>\n",
