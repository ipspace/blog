            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Ivan, 
Great blog as usual. For Orphan hosts,  I am not sure how it is of any concern if the MLAG peer link has to be used if the traffic lands on other switch. You can always build a 80G or a 200G etherchannel (still they will be underutilized most of the times) MLAG peer link if there are too many orphan hosts. I think using single/anycast VTEP IP address in MLAG is perfect and works for all scenarios.</p>

<p>On your other question on EVPN ESI Multihoming, Route Types 1 and 4 exactly come to the rescue here for BUM traffic and Designated Forwarder concept from the ESI cluster members. 
But the 2 or &gt;2 A/A ESI leafs from the ESI members will have lot of BGP EVPN route updates state churn happening within the layer 3 fabric.</p>
