            <div class="comment-content"><p>At my last job we managed to achieve EVPN interop between Cumulus and Arista (due to different functionality not lead time) but we had to turn off Cumulus automagic and make the config more explicit. And yes, we &quot;solved&quot; the problem of generating voluminous configs using Ansible but that still leaves you open to typos. I guess that&#39;s why vendors are pushing &quot;digital twin&quot; simulations or config verification tools. Ultimately I think we need to move beyond text config files and templating but that&#39;s probably 10-20 years away for most people.</p>

<p>In retrospect I wish we had just built an L2 network.</p>
