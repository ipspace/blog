And yes, we &quot;solved&quot; the problem of generating voluminous configs using Ansible but that still leaves you open to typos. I guess that&#39;s why vendors are pushing &quot;digital twin&quot; simulations or config verification tools. Ultimately I think we need to move beyond text config files and templating but that&#39;s probably 10-20 years away for most people.</p>\n\n<p>In retrospect I wish we had just built an L2 network.</p>\n",
