The Mellanox Spectrum switchdev driver is fantastic, and the Sparx-5 driver is extremely promising.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly the Marvell Prestera driver doesn&#39;t actually drive their ASIC, but instead is an RPC proxy to an extra CPU that doesn&#39;t exist on 99% of Prestera switches. Oh well.</p>\n\n<p>If I still had my youthful energy, I would write a SwitchDevInUserSpace driver (SDUSE?) and wire it up to the Open Source* Broadcom SDK:\nhttps://github.com/Broadcom-Network-Switching-Software/OpenBCM</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I have not had a proper IP lawyer review their license, but it looks pretty MIT/BSDesque to me.</li>\n</ul>\n",
