  html: I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s only since December 2011 that it&#39;s &#39;SHOULD&#39;.
    Wasn&#39;t it earlier? I suppose politics came into play, selling IPsec separately
    from IPv6, among others.

  html: "IPsec was included based on the internet&#39;s founders original premise\
    \ of \u201Cany to any\u201D connectivity but to provide encrypted any to any connectivity.\
    \ The end hosts would manage their own SAs and SPI on a per connection to another\
    \ host basis. The extension headers are there to make it easier to achieve this,\
    \ but because of their presence folks believed it was \u201Con\u201D automatically.\
    \  Plus, with the addressing structure IPv6 provides the ability of anyone can\
    \ talk to anyone securely around the world with no Nat, vpn tunnels, gateways,\
    \ etc in between.. Just pure IPv6 to IPv6 client securely. We may get there with\
    \ all the tablets, phones and IP enabled commerce machines, like soda etc.<br\
    \ /><br />For those interested read <br />Protocol Politics: The Globalization\
    \ of Internet Governance (Information Revolution and Global Politics)<br />by\
    \ Laura DeNardis<br />A great read not only on IPv6 history and geo politics involved\
    \ in getting it going but also on IPv4\u2019s history."
