  html: Without strong network-focused architects in an Enterprise/Organization, the
    shiny gem of migration of machines in a metropolitan (or larger) area without
    a corresponding address change seems so easy and magical.<br /><br />Its really
    hard to fight against that, especially if plans have already been made (or executed!)
    implementing L2 DCI.<br /><br />If you can&#39;t fight this tide, I think a compromise
    would be in order. An intelligent application segmentation plan where you isolate
    applications that cannot use application HA or GLB (not many GOOD reasons exist
    in modern, supported application) from the rest that can, and then only allowing
    the VLANs for these nasty legacy apps across a DCI. <br /><br />If you can put
    in all the appropriate measures in place to prevent br/mu storms, you can just
    live with only the unknown unicast noise you must.
