    html: Umm... the management is provided by two different groups, so VM-FEX solves
      the political problem as well.<br /><br />Generally the network group manages
      the networking and systems/server group manages the VM piece. So VMFEX/802.1BR
      actually decomplicates things drastically.<br /><br />The network person creates
      the port-profiles in the Nexus gear upstream which just show up in the VM as
      vSwitch options for the Sys admin to attach the VM to.<br /><br />The sys admin
      gets a user friendly name of the VLAN without having to configure any of the
      networking components (Teaming, Hash algorithm, VLAN Tags, Spanning-tree, etc.)
      <br /><br />Beyond that, there is the benefits of the VIC providing direct access
      to the physical NIC&#39;s memory space through VMDirectPath, which removes the
      2 Gbps limitation of the hypervisor vSwitch meaning in the not so distant future
      when we have 40 Gbps NICs in the back of a node you can actually use all of
      that for 1 VM.

    html: 2 Gbps per vSwitch is a myth, maybe persisting from the old days of vSphere
      3. I was able to push 10Gbps through a 10GE uplink with vSphere 4 (and 17 Gbps
      between VMs in the same hypervisor).

  html: The fact that its a IEEE 802.xx standard may indicate why its lagging industry
    outlook.<br /><br />--<br /><br />I disagree that VM-FEX are &#39;highly attractive&#39;.
    I struggle to find any operational benefits for most if not all virtualisation
    customers. <br /><br />AFAIK - The hypervisor bypass features usally grant speed
    and remove or limit functionality. <br /><br />At a strech I could envision using
    VM-FEX&#39;s to break out a virtual firewall/NAS-headend/backup-server etc, to
    gain performance improvements. <br /><br />But moving away from the centralised
    operational model (i.e vCenter) is a _significant_ downside.

  html: I was one of the developer of IEEE-802.1BR, so in case you want to know the
    real story let me know :-), however something I can unveil here 802.1QbH and 802.1BR
    is exactly the same and there is a clear reason why we renamed this, would be
    a longer thing, but in case of interest I can share the entire history with you
    ... .<br />Everything called Fex from us Cisco is based on BR (actually running
    on the pre-standard VNTAG), chassis Fex (nexus 2k) Adapter Fex, UCS FI, or VMFex
    (which is nothing else than an adapter Fex with some more os sw on top bringing
    the Fex (bridge port extender) into an OS. .... Best regards Rene<br />
