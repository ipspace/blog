      "html": "IPsec was included based on the internet&#39;s founders original premise of \u201cany to any\u201d connectivity but to provide encrypted any to any connectivity. The end hosts would manage their own SAs and SPI on a per connection to another host basis. The extension headers are there to make it easier to achieve this, but because of their presence folks believed it was \u201con\u201d automatically.  Plus, with the addressing structure IPv6 provides the ability of anyone can talk to anyone securely around the world with no Nat, vpn tunnels, gateways, etc in between.. Just pure IPv6 to IPv6 client securely. We may get there with all the tablets, phones and IP enabled commerce machines, like soda etc.<br /><br />For those interested read <br />Protocol Politics: The Globalization of Internet Governance (Information Revolution and Global Politics)<br />by Laura DeNardis<br />A great read not only on IPv6 history and geo politics involved in getting it going but also on IPv4\u2019s history.",
