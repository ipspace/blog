    html: 'Hi Brad, that&#39;s a very good question.  Without going into the precise
      details of the synchronization mechanisms, here&#39;s the basic idea:  Virtual
      network configuration, such as the virtual topology, is eventually consistent
      with respect to changes made via the REST API, while per flow state is statistically
      highly consistent, though not linearizable.  We use a combination of ZooKeeper
      and Cassandra to implement the &quot;central database&quot;.  MidoNet agents
      make independent decisions, such as handling control packets like ARP, ICMP,
      DHCP and setting up new flows, based on their local view of the virtual network
      state.  If the virtual network configuration (virtual topology as well as virtual
      device config) changes and two edges see that change with a lag delta, then
      some flows will be forwarded according to the old configuration while others
      are forwarded according to the new configuration (during the period of convergence).
      The flows are all correct with respect to at least one valid configuration (since
      decisions are all taken at the ingress edge node). Which flows are still being
      forwarded according to the old configuration is arbitrary, but that&#39;s fine.
      Existing flows are also invalidated and recomputed when configuration changes.'

    html: 'So Cassandra and ZooKeeper work as a replacement for OpenFlow. No network
      protocols. No central controller. Distributed state synchronised via a distributed
      DB and distributed systems tools.<br /><br />Why not go with OpenFlow?<br />How
      are convergence times calculated?<br />What happens with wrong flows that are
      setup before state is consistent? Are they a drop &amp; retry? Is the flow forwarded
      to the correct destination by the previous destination as if nothing had happened?<br
      /><br />Many thanks, innovative solution. ;)<br /><br />Pablo Carlier. - (Disclaimer:

  html: There is mention of a &quot;central database&quot;, but it&#39;s also stated
    this is a distributed system with no centralized control plane. How do the forwarding
    agents in each OVS synchronize and achieve consistent state?<br />

    few OC12 PCI express cards in your UCS chassis or blade enclosure and toss those
    ASRs out.<br /><br />I hear Cisco has similar functionality with their CRS.

    html: Hi Derick, thanks for the positive comment!<br /><br />We created this virtual
      device model in order to provide a familiar interface that blends be best of
      VRFs, Amazon VPC, and L2 switching.<br /><br />The VRF model seems to map well
      to the multi-tenant IaaS cloud (OpenStack) use case.  Our OpenStack plugin creates
      a virtual router per &quot;project&quot; (virtual data center, VPC, whatever
      term you like), and attaches multiple L2 networks to it.  The service provider&#39;s
      virtual router is wired to each of the projects for routing global IPs.

    zones separate as VRFs...  This is kind of awesome right here.

    html: When a VM is migrated by the cloud management system, e.g. OpenStack, the
      virtual port to which the VM is logically attached is bound to a tap/veth on
      the target host, at the end of the migration process.  At that time, the new
      mapping of vport to host is propagated to all MidoNet edges who have flows going
      to that vport, at which point those flows are updated to tunnel to the new target
      host.  So unlike some other forms of vMotion, there is no need to use gratuitous
      ARP to update switch state, or any such nonsense.

  html: 'The virtual routers are not really instances of routers, but rather just
    configuration state which the MidoNet agents at the edges use to simulate the
    flows as they would traverse the virtual network topology.  So while the virtual
    router is abstract, the uplink ports of the virtual router are bound to actual
    ethernet interfaces on edge gateway nodes.  The edge gateway nodes run BGP sessions
    with the upstream peers, and update the routing table in the distributed database,
    which is then shared with other MidoNet agents, as needed. '

      meant I&#39;ve not seen any other company or open source project which has a
      virtual router on the hypervisor. And I only found this article yesterday. I
      can setup routing software on Linux, if Linux is running the hypervisor, but
      then you have to figure it all out on yourself.

    /><br />There should be a lot more companies doing this.<br /><br />And why were
    these never mentioned on the packetpushers website or in the podcast ? ;-)<br
    /><br />No really, I&#39;ve been searching for a similar to their solution for
    months now. I know it kind of looks like it they are going against the whole networking
    industry, but this really is the natural evolution.
