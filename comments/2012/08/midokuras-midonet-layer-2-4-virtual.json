          "html": "Hi Brad, that&#39;s a very good question.  Without going into the precise details of the synchronization mechanisms, here&#39;s the basic idea:  Virtual network configuration, such as the virtual topology, is eventually consistent with respect to changes made via the REST API, while per flow state is statistically highly consistent, though not linearizable.  We use a combination of ZooKeeper and Cassandra to implement the &quot;central database&quot;.  MidoNet agents make independent decisions, such as handling control packets like ARP, ICMP, DHCP and setting up new flows, based on their local view of the virtual network state.  If the virtual network configuration (virtual topology as well as virtual device config) changes and two edges see that change with a lag delta, then some flows will be forwarded according to the old configuration while others are forwarded according to the new configuration (during the period of convergence). The flows are all correct with respect to at least one valid configuration (since decisions are all taken at the ingress edge node). Which flows are still being forwarded according to the old configuration is arbitrary, but that&#39;s fine. Existing flows are also invalidated and recomputed when configuration changes.",
