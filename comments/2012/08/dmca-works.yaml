    html: That&#39;s not DMCA failure but Google&#39;s laziness. <br /><br />Instead
      of implementing the minimum due process (including the counter-claim ability
      of the &quot;offender&quot;) they decided to give all the power to people who
      could actually sue them (who cares about the users - they&#39;re a product anyway).
      <br /><br />Welcome to the wonderful world of &quot;free&quot; services and
      mass-scale peanut-harvesting (what else is ad-based revenue?)

    html: It IS a failure of DMCA that someone can submit such blatantly fraudulent
      copyright claims without consequence. I certainly agree that Google is being
      lazy in this case, but that&#39;s because DMCA is so one-sided about this issue.
      It makes Google liable for failure to comply with a valid notice, and shields
      them from liability to the true content owner for complying with a bogus notice.
      If you were Google in that case, what would you do?

    html: I&#39;m no lawyer (and you should never listen to any of my ramblings not
      related to networking) but the sample DMCA notice I used included the sentence
      &quot;Under penalty of perjury I certify that the information contained in the
      notification is both true and accurate, and I have the authority to act on behalf
      of the owner of the copyright(s) involved.&quot; <br /><br />Whether someone
      decides to follow up on fraudulent claims and what the penalty for one might
      be is in my naive understanding outside of the DMCA scope.

  html: Good advice to never send the notice to the NOC, we used to delete those emails
    all the time.
