      "html": "IRS is interesting to us for a few different reasons:<br />   - it&#39;s being developed in the IETF and is designed in consideration of existing networking standards (and operations)<br />   - it&#39;s not limited to low-level FIB programming (the networking equivalent of assembly programming)<br />   - allows a programmable interface into the control plane that isn&#39;t limited to configuration (potentially allows programming of various types of networking state)<br /><br />IRS is basically the IETF trying to tell the industry that &quot;you have to think bigger&quot; than just low-level hardware programming.  Exactly /what/ it programs is still up for (active and lively) debate.  Note that it&#39;s currently just a framework draft(really mostly a problem definition). Just /how/ you communicate to an IRS agent is yet undefined.  Likewise, what you can tell it (schema) is also undefined.<br /><br />It&#39;s certainly attractive from the point of view of a networking vendor, as it would open up the kind of abstract programming interface that Juniper&#39;s vision outlines (closing the application/network divide).  <br /><br />It will be interesting to see how this plays with the ONF. They could see IRS as competition -- particularly if it starts to include both FIB-level as well as control-plane level state programming (as I suspect it will).",
