          "html": "Umm... the management is provided by two different groups, so VM-FEX solves the political problem as well.<br /><br />Generally the network group manages the networking and systems/server group manages the VM piece. So VMFEX/802.1BR actually decomplicates things drastically.<br /><br />The network person creates the port-profiles in the Nexus gear upstream which just show up in the VM as vSwitch options for the Sys admin to attach the VM to.<br /><br />The sys admin gets a user friendly name of the VLAN without having to configure any of the networking components (Teaming, Hash algorithm, VLAN Tags, Spanning-tree, etc.) <br /><br />Beyond that, there is the benefits of the VIC providing direct access to the physical NIC&#39;s memory space through VMDirectPath, which removes the 2 Gbps limitation of the hypervisor vSwitch meaning in the not so distant future when we have 40 Gbps NICs in the back of a node you can actually use all of that for 1 VM.",

      "html": "The fact that its a IEEE 802.xx standard may indicate why its lagging industry outlook.<br /><br />--<br /><br />I disagree that VM-FEX are &#39;highly attractive&#39;. I struggle to find any operational benefits for most if not all virtualisation customers. <br /><br />AFAIK - The hypervisor bypass features usally grant speed and remove or limit functionality. <br /><br />At a strech I could envision using VM-FEX&#39;s to break out a virtual firewall/NAS-headend/backup-server etc, to gain performance improvements. <br /><br />But moving away from the centralised operational model (i.e vCenter) is a _significant_ downside.",
