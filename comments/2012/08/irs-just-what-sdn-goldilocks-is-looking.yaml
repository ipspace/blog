  html: even if it&#39;s not the right porridge. it&#39;s a kick in the right direction
    to start taking this problem space apart intelligently.

  html: IRS is interesting to us for a few different reasons:<br />   - it&#39;s being
    developed in the IETF and is designed in consideration of existing networking
    standards (and operations)<br />   - it&#39;s not limited to low-level FIB programming
    (the networking equivalent of assembly programming)<br />   - allows a programmable
    interface into the control plane that isn&#39;t limited to configuration (potentially
    allows programming of various types of networking state)<br /><br />IRS is basically
    the IETF trying to tell the industry that &quot;you have to think bigger&quot;
    than just low-level hardware programming.  Exactly /what/ it programs is still
    up for (active and lively) debate.  Note that it&#39;s currently just a framework
    draft(really mostly a problem definition). Just /how/ you communicate to an IRS
    agent is yet undefined.  Likewise, what you can tell it (schema) is also undefined.<br
    /><br />It&#39;s certainly attractive from the point of view of a networking vendor,
    as it would open up the kind of abstract programming interface that Juniper&#39;s
    vision outlines (closing the application/network divide).  <br /><br />It will
    be interesting to see how this plays with the ONF. They could see IRS as competition
    -- particularly if it starts to include both FIB-level as well as control-plane
    level state programming (as I suspect it will).
