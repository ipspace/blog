      "html": "upon all my memory and knowledge, the centralized control model only works with connection-oriented systems, where the control plane is not that &#39;busy&#39;. And actually that model has it&#39;s own pain, e.g. the reachability of the controller to all service node, the availability of the controller. I think Nicira is more clever in this, they just leverage the general model and framework of it, but actually mainly use it for management plane. ",
