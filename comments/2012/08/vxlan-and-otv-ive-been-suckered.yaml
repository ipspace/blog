  html: ohh come on Ivan, this post is practically on its knees begging for reference
    to RFC1925 section 2.11 :)<br /><br />

  html: GRE as an encapsulation for OTV was known already. Example of links:<br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps9441/ps9402/qa_c67-574969.html<br
    />http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Nexus_7000_-_OTV_-_Design_and_Configuration_Example<br
    />Frankly, nothing new. ;)

  html: This is pretty eye-opening.  Having GRE as the encapsulation is not well known
    - yes its *lightly* documented, but Cisco has promoted OTV/VXLAN (and LISP) as
    having encapsulation formats (IE ...&quot;VXLAN, OTV, and LISP frame formats share
    a similar-looking packet encapsulation structure...&quot; - google it) leading
    those interested to believe that with a similar encapsulation structure, hardware
    enabled encap/decap will be consistent across the Nexus product line once it has
    been integrated into the next module line (F3?).  Will that be the case or will
    we continue to need module 1 for OTV, module 2 for VXLAN and module 3 for LISP
    for scalable, hardware-based performance for cloud overlays. <br />I think that&#39;s
    the reason that some may feel suckered, as do I.  I give them the benefit of the
    doubt until the next round of modules come out and we see what&#39;s supported.

  html: Hey Ivan:<br /><br />So, you know, the path forward is not always as straightforward
    as we might like. :)  <br /><br />In this case, the OTV header format proposed
    in draft-hasmit-otv-03 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hasmit-otv-03) is the
    original proposed OTV header and has clear benefits in terms of its ability to
    be handled by the transit network providing connectivity for an overlay. This
    header is the header we want to converge to for all overlay encapsulations moving
    forward, hence the bit-by-bit match observed with the VXLAN and LISP headers.<br
    /><br />However, in order for Cisco to deliver OTV in a timely manner, we released
    an implementation on the Nexus 7000 that used an alternate encapsulation format
    that could be supported by existing switching hardware.  The work has been taking
    place at Cisco (and across the industry) to support the proposed UDP encapsulation
    and Cisco&#39;s newer lines of ASICs will support the UDP encapsulation, but in
    the intervening 2+ years customers have an option for a hardware accelerated solution
    they can work with.<br /><br />Since the goal of standards bodies is to achieve
    convergence and consensus, we elected to maintain a crisp forward-looking message
    and focus our IETF proposal on the UDP encapsulation. We feel the approach has
    paid off as the newer proposals such as VXLAN adopted the proposed header format.<br
    /><br />The use of an alternate encapsulation for the initial release of OTV has
    been openly socialized by Cisco since OTV was first released (and well ahead of
    the publication of the IETF draft) in forums such as Cisco Live, public Webinars
    and in docs like http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps9441/ps9402/qa_c67-574969.html
    . <br /><br />Our goal was for clarity and certainly not to imply that ASIC lines
    that precede the invention of OTV could actually support the proposed new UDP
    encapsulation scheme.<br /><br />Hope this helps helps.<br /><br />Regards,<br

  html: 'And so there is no chance that since OTV lost their charter due to IPR issues
    that Cisco used VMware and VXLAN to try to sneak in the OTV header and try to
    get vendors to support OTV in hardware &quot;by accident&quot;? '
