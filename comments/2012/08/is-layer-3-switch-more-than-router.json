      "html": "I am finding that the terms &#39;router&#39; and &#39;switch&#39; are beginning to only designate the primary function the vendor intended them to do.  Some features are taken for granted on a &#39;switch&#39; that are not present or lacking in features on a router.  For instance I have a customer who replaced a headend router and switch with an ASR9000.  That router is definitely primarily designed for ip routing and mpls and is a bit awkward for the layer2/vlan type stuff.  It does no properly do CDP on the sub interfaces and passes CDP traffic from other interfaces in the same bridge group.  Also the spanning-tree implementation is not very clear cut or well documented.  Am I doing layer2 bridging, yes.  Is it a powerful platform, yes.  Is it a pain to do some functions that would only take 2-3 commands on a &#39;normal switch&#39;, very much so.",

A switch has layer 2 ports that can be converted to layer 3, but this is done by the control plane (your reference to the hidden VLANs matches this).<br />Now, if the control plane takes a hit and crashes due to a bug, a router crashes and goes offline or reboots. However, a switch can start flooding in some sort of &#39;hub-mode&#39; if the data plane is still working. It means that any frame (data, CDP, BPDU) entering one ports exits all other ports, whether these ports where part of the same VLAN, a trunk, another VLAN access port, or a layer 3 port. It just floods.<br /><br />In other words: a layer 3 switch can become a layer 1 failure domain, regardless of the design of the higher layers. I have yet to see that happen to a router.",
