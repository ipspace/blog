          "html": "It IS a failure of DMCA that someone can submit such blatantly fraudulent copyright claims without consequence. I certainly agree that Google is being lazy in this case, but that&#39;s because DMCA is so one-sided about this issue. It makes Google liable for failure to comply with a valid notice, and shields them from liability to the true content owner for complying with a bogus notice. If you were Google in that case, what would you do?",
