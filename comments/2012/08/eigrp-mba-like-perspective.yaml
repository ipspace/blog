  html: Excellent comparison. Makes sense. I just wish Cisco wouldn&#39;t use such
    complicated terminology for all those EIGRP concepts. Maybe it&#39;s easier for
    native English speakers though.

  html: Dan, An EIGRP stub would be a captive consumer with no other options :-)

  html: A very good explanation of EIGRP Classical Metrics!<br />now for Wide Metrics
    he does need a new story -<br />maybe, maybe not ;)<br /><br />Definitely a more
    specific example like &quot;Sales in Clothes Shop&quot;

  html: "The relation to business costs is clever --especially since we actually call\
    \ &quot;metric&quot; costs in many instances. But I have a point of disagreement.\
    \ :-)<br /><br />&quot;Actually, that was the best EIGRP designers could do with\
    \ a distance vector routing protocol. The router, lacking the information on other\
    \ routers&#39; link costs, has no way of figuring out what next hop the neighbor\
    \ reporting higher distance is using (contrary to Loop-Free Alternate feature\
    \ in OSPF where the router knows its neighbor has a third-party next hop because\
    \ it has full visibility into neighbor\u2019s view of the area topology).&quot;<br\
    \ /><br />I wouldn&#39;t describe it this way --this makes it sound like the router\
    \ actually traces out the route to the destination using the LSDB to make certain,\
    \ hop by hop, that it doesn&#39;t lie along this alternate path. <br /><br />The\
    \ reality is LFAs and EIGRP FS&#39; work precisely the same way. In EIGRP, you\
    \ use the neighbor&#39;s cost directly. In a LS protocol, you calculate the neighbor&#39;s\
    \ cost by calculating an SPF from their perspective. In both cases the metric\
    \ is the determining factor, not a &quot;walk of the tree.&quot;<br /><br />Using\
    \ your neighbor&#39;s metric isn&#39;t &quot;the best you can do sans topology\
    \ information,&quot; it&#39;s the only thing you can do sans tunneling to make\
    \ certain traffic sent down this path will actually forward the traffic correctly\
    \ --that the alternate path is on the other side of the P/Q space, or the other\
    \ branch of the waterfall.<br /><br />The article on IP/FRR here might help explain\
    \ it better:<br /><br />http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac123/ac147/archived_issues/ipj_15-2/ipj_15-2.pdf"

    html: I totally agree with Ivan (not that you should have awaited for my agreement
      ;-)<br />LFA gives you the best possible FRR coverage next to RSVP FRR. in addition,
      LSDB gives visibility to accommodate for things like node protect, which is
      not possible with EIGRP. <br />EIGRP is still a distance vector protocol. Enhanced/advanced,
      but still distance vector.<br /><br />SRLG interaction with LFA is pretty weak
      though. with MPLS-TE, the PLR knows exactly what it has to deal with (SRLG links)
      upon a failure and builds a backup tunnel accordingly. with LFA, this is more
      complex as both the PLR *and* the new NH router have to make sure not to transverse
      the SRLG links. I don&#39;t think anyone ever went down this path, even the
      RFC AFAIK. SRLG in this context is limited to local links coloring, on the same
      node.

  html: Russ, it&#39;s my understanding LFA can use some next hops that EIGRP cannot.
    <br /><br />Assume my cost is 1000 and neighbor&#39;s cost is 1010. EIGRP will
    never use the neighbor as FS (because RD is too large), whereas LFA might if the
    cost between the neighbors is more than 10 (and LFA knows what the remote cost
    is based on topology information EIGRP doesn&#39;t have).<br /><br />Also, a router
    using LFA might actually be tracing out route to destination (running SPF from
    the perspective of the neighbor), which is even more important if you have to
    take in account SRLGs.

  html: He is good, Great stuff. I read and used Ivan&#39;s book back in 2001 for
    a major rip to EIGRP migration. Still a great read/classic. I still have the hard
    copy. SIA timers, Query boundary considerations,  Feasibility condition, redistributing
    and setting the K values to have EIGRP operate like RIP.
