            <div class="comment-content">Without strong network-focused architects in an Enterprise/Organization, the shiny gem of migration of machines in a metropolitan (or larger) area without a corresponding address change seems so easy and magical.<br /><br />Its really hard to fight against that, especially if plans have already been made (or executed!) implementing L2 DCI.<br /><br />If you can&#39;t fight this tide, I think a compromise would be in order. An intelligent application segmentation plan where you isolate applications that cannot use application HA or GLB (not many GOOD reasons exist in modern, supported application) from the rest that can, and then only allowing the VLANs for these nasty legacy apps across a DCI. <br /><br />If you can put in all the appropriate measures in place to prevent br/mu storms, you can just live with only the unknown unicast noise you must.</div>
