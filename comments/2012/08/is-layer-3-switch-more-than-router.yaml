    html: It was always my understanding that bridging was fast-switched and used
      MAC address table as forwarding cache. Use &quot;show interface switching&quot;
      to verify it is.

  html: Does bridging in software based platforms (7200/2600/etc) use interrupts?
    Is there a &#39;Bridging CEF&#39; of sorts? I&#39;ve always held the notion that
    IRB performance is on par with IP process switching performance, but I&#39;ve
    never actually tested it.

  html: I am finding that the terms &#39;router&#39; and &#39;switch&#39; are beginning
    to only designate the primary function the vendor intended them to do.  Some features
    are taken for granted on a &#39;switch&#39; that are not present or lacking in
    features on a router.  For instance I have a customer who replaced a headend router
    and switch with an ASR9000.  That router is definitely primarily designed for
    ip routing and mpls and is a bit awkward for the layer2/vlan type stuff.  It does
    no properly do CDP on the sub interfaces and passes CDP traffic from other interfaces
    in the same bridge group.  Also the spanning-tree implementation is not very clear
    cut or well documented.  Am I doing layer2 bridging, yes.  Is it a powerful platform,
    yes.  Is it a pain to do some functions that would only take 2-3 commands on a
    &#39;normal switch&#39;, very much so.

    html: Beyond interfaces (we run all Ethernet WAN connections, so it isn&#39;t
      a concern for me), I think the big thing is routing table size support.<br /><br
      />And routing protocol support on some cheaper L3 switches, or products like
      Brocade&#39;s latest ICX where the base L3 package includes only RIP and OSPF,
      and you need the advanced L3 package to get BGP.

  html: I think the main difference between routers and switches comes down to what
    WAN Interface types it can support.<br /><br />Most (not all) switches cannot
    handle an OC3.

    html: It is not useless, with routed ports you have a better and fast convergence
      (.ie carrier-delay to 0, BFD ...) than with a SVI.

  html: So, migrating interconnection VLANs to routed ports in order to free VLANs
    is useless in the 6500? Or do you mean &quot;until you run out of VLAN IDs&quot;?

    html: Transit LSRs can only guess what&#39;s in the L3 datagrams after the MPLS
      envelope. Ingress and egress LSRs should know - egress one has assigned the
      label and ingress one is using it.<br /><br />The only time a transit LSR tries
      to figure out the payload type is when it&#39;s trying to send ICMP TTL exceeded.

    html: Completely agree, though my point was that how LSR knows that packet it
      received is MPLS IPV4 IPV6 etc...

    html: If a transit LSR needs to know the payload type, the only thing it can do
      is guess based on the first nibble in the payload (4 = ipv4, 6 =ipv6).

    html: LSR is not required to know the mpls payload .Normally ACLs are used to
      trap specific protocol pkts to CPU.

    don&#39;t they?<br />So are they switches?

  html: 'Shouldn&#39;t a physical L3 Interface be independent of Layer2 media .So
    logically speaking the L2 interface should strip the L2 header (802.11,PPP,ethernet

  html: 'There&#39;s another little quirk between a router and a switch in Cisco country.
    A router by definition has layer 3 interfaces. A switch has layer 2 ports that
    can be converted to layer 3, but this is done by the control plane (your reference
    to the hidden VLANs matches this).<br />Now, if the control plane takes a hit
    and crashes due to a bug, a router crashes and goes offline or reboots. However,
    a switch can start flooding in some sort of &#39;hub-mode&#39; if the data plane
    is still working. It means that any frame (data, CDP, BPDU) entering one ports
    exits all other ports, whether these ports where part of the same VLAN, a trunk,
    another VLAN access port, or a layer 3 port. It just floods.<br /><br />In other
    words: a layer 3 switch can become a layer 1 failure domain, regardless of the
    design of the higher layers. I have yet to see that happen to a router.'
