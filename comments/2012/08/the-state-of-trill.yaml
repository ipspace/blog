    html: You could, but VPLS gives you way more options (including MPLS TE and FRR).
      <br /><br />Go through the comments to my recent IXP post, they include some
      links to great presentations describing how large IXPs work.

    html: All hypervisor vendors are going in the direction of running L2 networks
      on top of IP. Hypervisor servers become simple IP hosts. No loop avoidance,
      no bridging, just IP, pure &amp; simple.

    html: Thanks for answering.<br /><br />  Right but the hypervisor server still
      needs to be connected to a physical switch right?  That&#39;s connected to a
      bunch of other physical switches to eventually connect to the WAN/Internet.  Those
      servers have MAC addresses and are connected by ethernet.  I just do not get
      it.

    html: Elementary - it&#39;s called IP routing. You configure switch uplinks as
      L3 interfaces and inter-switch links as IP subnets.<br /><br />How do you think
      Internet works? It&#39;s not one huge bridging domain.

  html: Still unclear how a Vswitch removes the need for physical switch inter-connectivity
    loop avoidance.

    html: I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath waiting for low-cost TRILL boxes ... but then
      HP has TRILL on the 5900 switches.

    html: Why is this comment from someone anonymous? Any one showing their real name
      would not hope for problematic implementations.<br />Good to know HP has it.
      Ebay price around 4,000 USD.

    \ /><br />Btw, does anyone TRILL test units, i.e. boxes with ~4 ports (may it\
