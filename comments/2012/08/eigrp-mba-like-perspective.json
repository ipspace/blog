This is probably the book the training vendors have on their bookshelf.<br /><br />I&#39;ll probably be skipping the AppleTalk/IPX sections, but the rest of the chapters look like an EIGRP tour de force tailored specifically for that section of the CCIE Blueprint (and whatever legacy EIGRP environments you may run into) and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if giving the case studies in this book a serious look won&#39;t get you ALL points on the EIGRP section of the exam. <br /><br />Compare the topics in the CCIE Blueprint vs. the Chapters in the book:<br /><br />CCIE Blueprint<br />--------------------<br />2.50 Implement IPv4 Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) <br />(a) Best path <br />(b) Loop-free paths <br />(c) EIGRP operations when alternate loop-free paths are available, and when they are not available <br />(d) EIGRP queries <br />(e) Manual summarization and autosummarization <br />(f) EIGRP stubs<br /><br />EIGRP Network Design Solutions<br />--------------------------------<br />1.\u00a0EIGRP Concepts and Technology.<br />2.\u00a0Advanced EIGRP Concepts, Data Structures, and Protocols.<br />5.\u00a0Scalability Issues in Large Enterprise Networks.<br />6.\u00a0EIGRP Route Summarization.<br />7.\u00a0Route Filters.<br />8.\u00a0Default Routes.<br />12.\u00a0Switched WAN Networks and Their Impact on EIGRP ***read Frame Relay***<br />13.\u00a0Running EIGRP over WAN Networks.<br />15.\u00a0Secure EIGRP Operation.",

      "html": "The relation to business costs is clever --especially since we actually call &quot;metric&quot; costs in many instances. But I have a point of disagreement. :-)<br /><br />&quot;Actually, that was the best EIGRP designers could do with a distance vector routing protocol. The router, lacking the information on other routers&#39; link costs, has no way of figuring out what next hop the neighbor reporting higher distance is using (contrary to Loop-Free Alternate feature in OSPF where the router knows its neighbor has a third-party next hop because it has full visibility into neighbor\u2019s view of the area topology).&quot;<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t describe it this way --this makes it sound like the router actually traces out the route to the destination using the LSDB to make certain, hop by hop, that it doesn&#39;t lie along this alternate path. <br /><br />The reality is LFAs and EIGRP FS&#39; work precisely the same way. In EIGRP, you use the neighbor&#39;s cost directly. In a LS protocol, you calculate the neighbor&#39;s cost by calculating an SPF from their perspective. In both cases the metric is the determining factor, not a &quot;walk of the tree.&quot;<br /><br />Using your neighbor&#39;s metric isn&#39;t &quot;the best you can do sans topology information,&quot; it&#39;s the only thing you can do sans tunneling to make certain traffic sent down this path will actually forward the traffic correctly --that the alternate path is on the other side of the P/Q space, or the other branch of the waterfall.<br /><br />The article on IP/FRR here might help explain it better:<br /><br />http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac123/ac147/archived_issues/ipj_15-2/ipj_15-2.pdf",

          "html": "I totally agree with Ivan (not that you should have awaited for my agreement ;-)<br />LFA gives you the best possible FRR coverage next to RSVP FRR. in addition, LSDB gives visibility to accommodate for things like node protect, which is not possible with EIGRP. <br />EIGRP is still a distance vector protocol. Enhanced/advanced, but still distance vector.<br /><br />SRLG interaction with LFA is pretty weak though. with MPLS-TE, the PLR knows exactly what it has to deal with (SRLG links) upon a failure and builds a backup tunnel accordingly. with LFA, this is more complex as both the PLR *and* the new NH router have to make sure not to transverse the SRLG links. I don&#39;t think anyone ever went down this path, even the RFC AFAIK. SRLG in this context is limited to local links coloring, on the same node.",

      "html": "Russ, it&#39;s my understanding LFA can use some next hops that EIGRP cannot. <br /><br />Assume my cost is 1000 and neighbor&#39;s cost is 1010. EIGRP will never use the neighbor as FS (because RD is too large), whereas LFA might if the cost between the neighbors is more than 10 (and LFA knows what the remote cost is based on topology information EIGRP doesn&#39;t have).<br /><br />Also, a router using LFA might actually be tracing out route to destination (running SPF from the perspective of the neighbor), which is even more important if you have to take in account SRLGs.",
