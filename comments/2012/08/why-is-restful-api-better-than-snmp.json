         "html": "HTTP/REST is certainly easier in some respects, but SNMP does have quite a few advantages. It supports types, MIBs are an excellent source of documentation for an API and those APIs tend to be considerably more stable than their RESTful cousins (the RabbitMQ management plugin API has changed in every single version I&#39;ve deployed and broken nagios checks every time). Many of these APIs are even standardised (and some vendors even stick to them sometimes). There are some missing things, like properly standardised floats and doubles.<br /><br />  Not to mention traps, a decent (if loathed) security model in v3, no TCP 3 way handshake (unless you want it). Stuff like EVENT-MIB and EXPRESSION-MIB give you standard server-side functionality. net-snmp does a pretty good job of doing most of the really hard stuff for you.<br /><br />  The real problem for SNMP is that it is something else to learn and doesn&#39;t work well if you stick to the bare minimum. Doing tables properly is hard (that&#39;s trivial in a XML or JSON based REST API). People don&#39;t even think about using things like contexts. MIBs are also scarily close to actually writing documentation, which is never going to go down well with the majority of developers. It hasn&#39;t helped that most examples of SNMP usage try and bypass MIBs completely and use numeric oids for everything which makes examples practically impossible to read and gives SNMP a scary, super complicated air about it. You can do without MIBs, but that doesn&#39;t mean you should, you can always replace the textual values with the OIDs once you&#39;ve worked everything out.<br /><br />  I think SNMP&#39;s time may have come, but it has merits that we are losing with HTTP REST APIs, just not ones that people care about that much. How much they should care is open for debate.<br /><br />",

When they looked into it, the thinking was that SNMP can be a bitter a pill for people to swallow in the embedded Linux market.  However, they also noted that tying our C++ code into the backend of a RESTful API would also be a pain.<br />The bottom line is that we wanted a tool to allow us to run either efficient like SNMP or a bit more convenient like REST, so we developed a pretty neat control protocol and released it on GitHub.  I don&#39;t know if it would replace SNMP in anyone&#39;s system, but it might be worth a look see.<br />https://github.com/democosm/hc-cpp<br />Some extra detail is here:<br />http://www.democosm.com",

The bigger problem with snmp was how vendors implemented convoluted MIBs that were not documented well and were difficult to understand.  Also every vendor (as well as internal group) had their own way of doing things that was different.  I really don&#39;t see that same fundamental problem changing with the xml based technologies since everyone will have their own schema that works differently.<br /><br />SNMP was suppose to create a unified cross-platform device interaction framework, however it did not.  The same thing is being attempted and proposed with these new solutions.  I really don&#39;t see them fixing it, since it is not the technology that is the limiting factor but rather the way people implement it.  I think imaging a grand unified cross platform/vendor interaction framework is really a pipe dream.<br /><br />Thanks for the discussion Ivan, I&#39;m really enjoying it.  I really enjoy getting people to think about things so we can improve ourselves and each other.",

A Cross-Platform RESTful API would allow programmers and systems-scripters alike to adopt OnePK as their SDN platform from Day One.<br /><br />Examples:<br />(1) Ethan could write Perl scripts to manage TCAM or routing tables (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc)<br />(2) You could write scalable webapps for, say, network monitoring, in Ruby, PHP, etc.<br />(3) Enterprises with an internal development team would be able to write .NET applications for integrated inventory and network provisioning.<br /><br />Providing OnePK as a cross-platform RESTful API would allow immediate adoption by a considerably broader audience, many of whom influence the decision of which SDN strategy to adopt in their environment.<br /><br />-Mike<br />",

         "html": "Ignoring implementation differences such as programmer familiarity and ease of use (which are of course important!), from a protocol perspective IMO the major difference between SNMP and HTTP is that SNMP specifies not only the transport layer but also the structure of the data in the PDUs - when you request an OID the client already knows what the type of the data is from the MIB.<br /><br />HTTP does not enforce this coupling of the transport and the message content. Whilst it is possible to request a particular MIME type encoding (i.e. text/html), the format of the response is not defined by the HTTP protocol specification. Of course, the client and server can use a MIME-type which has the ability to use schema to describe the messages (such as XML) - but then you&#39;re starting to look more SOAPy and less RESTy.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know if there are existing standards that provide schemas for defining the messages content - if there aren&#39;t any then the future will be painful for anyone who wants to interact with multiple vendors each of whom is using their own schema.<br /><br />To avoid this, I would like to propose the intriguing possibility of adding a new MIME type of text/snmp - allowing the HTTP REST&#39;ful approach to be used with the schema and data types of SNMP!<br /><br />For example a HTTP GET with the to the URL:<br />http://switch1/get_status/oid/1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3<br /><br />would return the ASN1.1 representation of the switches system uptime (or perhaps a JSON representation of the same).<br /><br />Perhaps this could be made part of the FCoTR alliance?<br /><br />PS. After I had this novel idea (to me anyhow), I searched and found this RFC draft: http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-mellquist-web-sys-00.txt - which is similar in scope, although they just POST the SNMP PDU in the HTTP body don&#39;t use the OID in the path of the URL.",

It was almost a decade before vendors started to implement SNMP v3 in any significant way. <br /><br />MIB files are a huge pain in the ass to parse, especially with your eyeball. The tools available are equally as crappy. <br /><br />RESTful APIs allow a much easier way to get access to data and do configuration. XML is a shitload easier to parse than a MIB file. And REST allows PKI (SSL/TLS and certificates and such) which offer much better (potential) security. <br /><br />Like modem init strings, OIDs haunt my dreams at night.

SNMP has one (possible) advantage over REST, which is that it is connectionless. After that, it is a horror show. </p>\n\n<p>The biggest issue is probably the amount of space that OIDs consume in limited-size packets. GetBulk did not end up implementing any OID compression, and so when walking a table of counters, gauges, or states, for example, almost the entire, precious 1500 byte packet capacity is consumed transporting OIDs. In the real world, packet fragmentation and reassembly does not work well, and so you have to carefully craft your request packets to avoid size overruns in responses. </p>\n\n<p>The only traversal semantic is SNMP is GetNext/GetBulk. There is no filtering, that I am aware of, and scoping is only available by specifying more of the OID prefix, which is limiting. </p>\n\n<p>Table walk semantics are difficult to implement correctly for sparse tables. Even if you implement that correctly, you have to be careful which other columns your GetBulk runs over into at the end of the table. We had a case where the last row of a table could never be fetched due to running over into an unrelated table with a too-large OCTET STRING. We had to create a custom table-walk algorithm for that specific table. </p>\n\n<p>Because many agents are single-threaded, you have to implement throttling on the management side to avoid spurious timeouts and retries. (Without throttling, requests queue up in the agent, including retries, and everything times out.)</p>\n\n<p>CRUD semantics for tables are difficult to implement correctly. At my last job, we almost got sued by a customer because one out of a sequence of SetRequest packets failed, and left a wide-open WLAN on their network. Since SetRequest is not idempotent, you cannot even retry those. </p>\n\n<p>There are other parts of the protocol I could pick on, such as community strings for authentication, or OID index parsing, or the difficult-to-use InetAddress/InetAddressType data types. There is a lot that did not age well. </p>\n\n<p>Another commenter stated that SNMP is a terrible protocol that needs to die. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d go that far, but for managing a device of any complexity, it is so much better to implement a REST API. You have reliability and the ability to stream large amounts of data, if needed. Scoping and filtering are available via URLs and query parameters. JSON encoding is not even much more verbose than all of the SNMP OIDs that come back in GetBulk. When you ask for a table of data, you don&#39;t get unrelated tables. You don&#39;t have to implement &quot;sparse walk&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>REST APIs also allow for various authentication schemes that HTTP supports. TLS is supported simply. </p>\n\n<p>There are dozens of open source libraries and frameworks for HTTPS, REST, and JSON. </p>\n\n<p>REST is just superior. Anyone who says &quot;SNMP can do anything that REST does&quot; has, I would wager, never spent much time maintaining a sophisticated SNMP-based management application. I have done that, and I guarantee that the statement that the two protocols are equivalent is naive. </p>\n",
