      "html": "Will, stateless firewalls doesn&#39;t care about symmetric routing. Load balancers typically do, but they&#39;re close to the servers (which has state anyway).<br /><br />What I want to avoid is centralised state in the network itself - the data center network is shared between multiple customers, and I don&#39;t want any stateful devices in the shared infrastructure for reliability and performance reasons. That there&#39;s state kept inside a single customer&#39;s infrastructure is unavoidable, but if a DoS attack fills the state tables in a single customer&#39;s load balancer, other customers are unaffected. If the attack fills the state tables for a centralised NAT44 solution, *every* customer is affected.<br /><br />Tore",

      "html": "Martin B, in my testing i found that this command would do the static mapping I wanted. However, it invokes stateful mode - the source address will be mapped into the prefix defined by &quot;nat64 prefix stateful&quot;, and all flows show up in the output of &quot;show nat64 translations&quot;.<br /><br />I would very much like to see a feature that did the exact same thing for stateless mode. Adding the IPv4-translatable addresses to the servers, and static routes to them on the server&#39;s default gateways, importing them into the IGP ... I don&#39;t *like* this solution - it just works for a proof of concept test. For a production deployment, it would be much better (less hassle and complexity) to have a list of static mappings pushed to all the translators, and do nothing special with the servers or their access routers.<br /><br />Tore",
