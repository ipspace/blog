There is a multicast on L2 only and it is used just to reach all cluster members if they are connected to switch. If they are connected to hub, then you would not need multicast at all.<br /><br />The only thing you have to do is to make static arp entry which will &quot;connect&quot; your multicast L2 (MAC) address with your virtual IP address. Why? Because router can&#39;t accept a multicast MAC address as an valid ARP reply due to RFC1812 (Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers):<br /><br /><br />3.3.2 Address Resolution Protocol - ARP<br /><br />[snip]<br />A router MUST not believe any ARP reply that claims that the Link<br />Layer address of another host or router is a broadcast or multicast address.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />HTH,<br /><br />--<br />-Ivan.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Another relevant article by Greg:<br />http://etherealmind.com/checkpoint-nokia-firewall-cluster-xl/",

If the AVG sourced the reply from the AVF&#39;s hardware address, that would screw up L2 filtering tables, so mismatched hardware addresses here too. Thankfully, it&#39;s all unicast this time around, so the mismatch is only interesting, and not bogus.<br /><br />Are there any other reasons why these two L2 addresses wouldn&#39;t match?",

See 802.3 sections 2.3.1.2 and 2.3.2.2.<br /><br />Strictly speaking, what you&#39;re referring to here is the &quot;hardware address of sender&quot; in the ARP reply payload described by RFC 826, not the source hardware address.<br /><br />Usually these two addresses (the one in the ARP payload, and the one in the frame header) are the same, but I&#39;m not aware of any requirement that they match.",
