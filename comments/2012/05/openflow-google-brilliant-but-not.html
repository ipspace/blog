            <div class="comment-content">Thanks Ivan for commenting the PR - I agree with the views from this article.<br /><br />When Google will become as transparent as others, that&#39;s when I will consider a new era...<br /><br />They have one of the least challenging environment in the world, i.e. almost unlimited resources, access to the most talented engineers (along with their ego ;-)) but share almost nothing of their own dev.<br /><br />Now one would wonder if it is because the applicability of what they develop is just unique to Google, especially this massive use of TE... application is what drives Google dev, I think this use case of OF is just a confirmation to me.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">You are seriously off-base here on several points:<br /><br />- Google is very transparent, and I actually challenge you to show me where Cisco or Juniper or Brocade or HP or anyone else will ever tell you even one small piece of how their internal networks are built. There are countless links and videos out there, from Google directly, that give you insight into how our servers, datacenters, &amp; networks operate. Obviously, we can&#39;t give you every single detail, and no one else will either.<br /><br />- We have one of the most challenging environments, because when you operate at the scale we do, no one out there can provide services to meet the needs, so we end up having to be the solution ourselves. We have to come up with ways to do things that no one else can, and to do that, you need resources, so yes, we have a lot of talent in-house, but it&#39;s not that these engineers are that much better than anyone else - it&#39;s that they are highly motivated and want to push their limits and do things that no one else is doing. You sound like someone that didn&#39;t make it through the interviews and are disgruntled. Get over it and try again.<br /><br />- Of course we&#39;re not going to share our own intellectual property if that is what is giving us a competitive advantage to the Bings and Baidus and Yahoos and Facebooks. To expect Google, or anyone for that matter, to give up all of our trade secrets is just plain stupid and demonstrative that you have no idea how this industry really works or how businesses actually make money.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan, Good post, many smart points. Still, I differ slightly on a few. You hint that perhaps Google&#39;s actions will &quot;persuade hardware vendors and chipset manufacturers to implement more OpenFlow capabilities&quot;. Hmm. Maybe, but chipsets are not the barrier, as demonstrated by Google&#39;s use of off-the-shelf chips. The question is, will (&quot;hardware&quot;) vendors add software support for some open control manipulation protocol. (Probably we should say &quot;system&quot; vendors, but nobody does.) And does OpenFlow matter? As you say, they need to manipulate control state somehow. Google could have used a proprietary protocol, but they wanted to demonstrate that there was a viable open protocol, so seems like choice of OpenFlow offers an existence proof that some problems can be solved using an open control state manipulation protocol (it&#39;s not like there are dozens). As for &quot;Will someone else repeat their feat and bring a low-cost high-end router to the market?&quot;, how can you bring that box to market if there are no controller vendors highlighting that application? One might imagine that Google itself is the market, but how many will buy that argument?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The revolution is that it went beyond all the OpenFlow &quot;hype&quot; and actually put it into some kind of action. The market is flooded with people talking about OpenFlow and SDN, but the practicality of it is beyond the reach of most enterprises and networks out there. That could be because of hardware limitations, but I feel the more realistic limitation is in the engineer&#39;s ability to actually come up with a useful scenario for trying to fit OpenFlow into existing environments.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Average link utilisation above 90% would imply that is in working case (i.e. average) conditions, which would also imply &gt;100% link utilisation (unless they load balance over more than 10 parallel paths) in failure cases.  It&#39;s not that you can&#39;t run networks today with link utilisations above 90% but that in practise most providers plan for failure cases hence the average util is &lt;90% by implication.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan,<br /><br />I found this very interesting post reading the latest one about Openflow focus at L2-L4.<br /><br />With regards to: &quot;some networks are supposedly still running offline TE computations and static MPLS TE tunnels because they give you way better results than the distributed MPLS-TE/autobandwidth/automesh kludges.&quot; - I understand the most frequent reason for that is so called &quot;tunnel packing problem&quot; described here: http://fengnet.com/book/TE_MPLS/ch09lev1sec5.html, isn&#39;t it?<br /><br />As for &quot;MPLS-TP is also going in the same direction – paths are computed by NMS, which then installs in/out label mappings&quot; - NMS is not a MUST, nor even a SHOULD, just one of the options provided by RFC5921 section 3.14.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The MPLS TE problems are best described in the RIPE64 video I&#39;ve linked to in the note in the article. Tunnel packing (or, more general, knapsack problem) is just one of them.<br /><br />Thanks for the MPLS-TP note. I know NMS is not mandatory, but it&#39;s interesting to see MPLS-TP moving in that same direction (actually, it&#39;s moving in all directions at once, but let&#39;s not go there ;) )</div>
