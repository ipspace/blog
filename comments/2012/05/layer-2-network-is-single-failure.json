I work in datacenters but on the facilities side and I have been burned many times by industrial devices that have poor/limited tcp/ip stack or in some cases, devices not able to route back to their server leaving me with having to span layer two across a couple switches.  I have implemented storm control but as you mentioned, that may not be enough to stop a meltdown.  I&#39;m curious how I can overcome that hurdle while maintaining your recommendation about splitting the layer-2 domain through layer-3 switches.",

I run a single tenant data center for a huge company (60K plus users)<br /><br />I can have a huge network that is broken up into a huge amount of small L2 broadcast domains all connected to the same core switch pair (or aggregate if you&#39;re a Cisco guy)<br /><br />If one of those tiny L2 broadcast domains loop, then your core switches lock up, and your whole network goes down.  &quot;single circulating broadcast packet (and its infinite copies) will trigger storm control on ALL SWITCHES, and prevent other valid broadcasts&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;ve tested various loops scenarios in a large scale network (300+ TOR switches and a pair of Cisco 7Ks).  I&#39;ve found storm control doesn&#39;t work in 10Gb networks with Cisco FEX.  I&#39;ve found port-security does work well although increases trouble ticets(opex).  I&#39;ve found that default COPP works awesomely in keeping your Nexus 7Ks alive so you can find the loop. I&#39;ve found my best bet is to configure the network to prevent loops and not try and configure around loops.  And screw the ideals of preventing loops by telling your cabling crew to cable properly!!  That will work for 6 months or a year until they forget again.<br /><br />So who cares how big your L2 domains are?  And if you have the same aggregate switch pair (everyone does) then it doesnt matter how many load balanceers or firewall instances you have. I&#39;d say your chances are equally the same taking out your data center.  In fact....if you cable differently for smaller L2 domains then I&#39;d say your chances go up!  But You do lose mobility and scalability the smaller you make your L2 domains.<br /><br />I dont even want to talk about mac-in-mac or mac-in-multicast.  No one is there yet.<br /><br />I dont even want to talk about STP replacement.  No one is there yet.<br /><br />I&#39;d perhaps consider multiple aggregate layer switches (if the 7Ks had the capacity for more than four VDC).  That limitation makes VDC useless except for your Development instance.<br /><br />Ivan, btw, will you be in San Diego this month?",

      "html": "Ivan,<br /><br />Thanks for calling out storm control as the preemptive DoS attack that it is.<br /><br />That feature is just a turd in my opinion:<br /><br />1) The granularity is terrible - it&#39;s not a throttle, it just counts bytes over a 1 second (I think?) interval, and then throws data away for the remainder of the second once the threshold has been hit. Awful, unless you set it to 10% with the expectation that your server ports will be deaf to some protocols for 90% of every second...<br /><br />2) Who am I (as the network admin) to decide when a server has sent &quot;too many&quot; broadcast or multicast frames? I&#39;ve never seen anything along these lines codified in an SLA given to the user/server/application community. Accordingly, if a craplousy business application is built to work exclusively with broadcast frames, and it runs into storm control, guess what feature is going to be switched off?",

          "html": "Exactly my thinking.<br /><br />TRILL is actually closer to routing than to bridging, therefore it&#39;s a L2 protocol that incorporates most of the benefits of L3 protocols. TTLs prevent infinite loops, and in Cisco&#39;s FabricPath you get conversational MAC learning, which eases the burden of having to learn all addresses in your L2 domain.<br /><br />Still, I wonder how is it that SAN admins got away with deploying two independent and separate networks, and LAN admins did not. It is evident that the first hop L2 connection is a single failure domain, no matter how resilient it is. <br /><br />It&#39;s time Operating Systems and applications start supporting dual LAN designs so we can effectively protect this single failure domain.",
