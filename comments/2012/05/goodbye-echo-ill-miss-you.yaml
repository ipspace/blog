    html: That&#39;s the long-term plan. No time/energy to even consider it at the
      moment.

    html: I&#39;m a total fan of Italian cuisine, but not spaghetti code.<br /><br
      />Had to implement single signon with Wordpress a few years ago and decided
      never to touch that bowl of mixed pasta again.

  html: I prefer logging in to leave the comment. Captchas are somewhat annoying.<br
    /><br />On the other hand... Have you considered moving away from Blogger to WordPress?
    You would absolutely love the platform, I&#39;m certain.

  html: 'Like I said on Twitter: Disqus, not too hard too migrate and since you are
    not running a dynamic blogger template easy to implement. But agreed, it has to
    be done, carefully. So time/energy is useful.<br /><br />Talking about Spaghetti
    code: Albert Hitchcock, CIO of group Vodafone, said yesterday at ManagementWorld
    in Dublin  &quot;Agility is about transforming spaghetti into lasagna&quot;, meaning
    standardizing their networks.'

  html: Both methods are fine, but captcha is a little bit annoying. If you&#39;re
    looking for alternatives, Disqus is OK as already mentioned and I found this Livefyre
    (http://www.livefyre.com/) which seems to be interesting. Free plan, integration
    to WP and they are focused on conversations more than just comments. Can be a
    nice service, but I didn&#39;t try it yet.

  html: Your previous posting system didn&#39;t work with Windows 7 and so I could
    not read or post comments properly at work.  This is better.
