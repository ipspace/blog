            <div class="comment-content">might be a bit off topic here but i wonder just how much L4 info is useful with Openflow. that is, i can see a big issue with fragments as fragments following the first packet dont have the L4 info. so packet re-order issues are possible...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">It depends on where you want to use OpenFlow. You can use L4 info to implement PBR, NAT, SLB ... obviously with the same limitations that these technologies have in today&#39;s networks.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan,<br /><br />Full disclosure, I do work for Brocade. <br /><br />For some additional color on Brocade&#39;s &quot;SDN Strategy&quot;, see the following:<br /> http://community.brocade.com/community/brocadeblogs/data_center/blog/2012/05/24/software-defined-networking-openstack-openflow-it-is-all-about-innovation<br /><br />and<br />http://community.brocade.com/community/brocadeblogs/data_center/blog/2012/05/22/sdn-with-brocade-going-beyond-openflow<br /><br />and this on what the buzz words don&#39;t mean.<br />http://www.vyatta.com/content/mythical-magical-sdn<br /><br /><br />We do have &quot;yet another&quot; SDN strategy. (Perhaps having a strategy is better than having none?)  <br /><br />As a strategy, it tells a story of how point technologies such as OpenFlow, OpenStack, VCS Fabric, etc., could be combined to simplify large scale networks.  And, IMHO, an important goal of network architecture is to enable a network that is simple. But, as Scott Shenker points out, the current network engineeing paradigm worships complexity and the networking gurus who can read the entrails and advise the business. This isn&#39;t desirable, scalable nor profitable. Thus, fundamental changes including the idea of the control plane as a programming abstraction, instead of a protocol &quot;mashup&quot;, might prove promising.  <br /><br />We agree. Hence our investment, our strategy and delivery products that support that strategy.<br /><br />As is always the case in the practical world (sadly, the one without unicorns and their tears ;-)) real engineering and design takes real time and real money. So, functions, features and products aren&#39;t available all at once. Hence, the value of talking about our strategy is so customers have an appreciation of what our views are and the direction we are heading. Details maybe lacking, but they become apparent as products are deliverd, so &quot;all good things in their time.&quot; <br /><br />AFAIK, the MLX is indeed the first 100GE capable router with OpenFlow support. And, we use an OpenFlow controller we didn&#39;t write ourselves. That demonstrates that &quot;proprietary&quot; ASICs don&#39;t limit companies like Brocade from delilvering OpenFlow value to those of our customers who need it. Interestingly enough, the ones who need 100GE also need OpenFlow.<br /><br />Onward ...<br /><br />@BRCDbreams</div>
