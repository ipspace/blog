  html: Interesting post... I had always believed that VRRP utilized a Multicast MAC
    source but when I looked it up this morning that doesn&#39;t appear to be the
    case, 00-00-5E-00-01-XX. Where XX is the VRRP ID or instance.<br /><br />Why did
    I think it was a Multicast source?

  html: 'Ivan, I think I found something from you that has a date from 2006...there
    are many Ivan&#39;s, but I&#39;m guessing that was you all the way back then!  <br
    /><br />Source: http://www.velocityreviews.com/forums/t38552-checkpoint-ha-cluster-w-multicast.html<br
    /><br />&quot;Todd,<br /><br />you don&#39;t really need to enable multicast on
    routers at all. There is a multicast on L2 only and it is used just to reach all
    cluster members if they are connected to switch. If they are connected to hub,
    then you would not need multicast at all.<br /><br />The only thing you have to
    do is to make static arp entry which will &quot;connect&quot; your multicast L2
    (MAC) address with your virtual IP address. Why? Because router can&#39;t accept
    a multicast MAC address as an valid ARP reply due to RFC1812 (Requirements for
    IP Version 4 Routers):<br /><br /><br />3.3.2 Address Resolution Protocol - ARP<br
    /><br />[snip]<br />A router MUST not believe any ARP reply that claims that the
    Link<br />Layer address of another host or router is a broadcast or multicast
    address.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />HTH,<br /><br />--<br />-Ivan.&quot;<br

    html: Y&#39;know, come to think of it, I bet there truly isn&#39;t any requirement
      for the two hardware addresses (header and payload) to match.<br /><br />In
      the microsoft case, they&#39;d have to be sourcing the ARP replies from a unicast
      address, but we know they populate the reply with a multicast address.<br /><br
      />In the case of GLBP, we have one box (AVG) replying on behalf of another (AVF).
      If the AVG sourced the reply from the AVF&#39;s hardware address, that would
      screw up L2 filtering tables, so mismatched hardware addresses here too. Thankfully,
      it&#39;s all unicast this time around, so the mismatch is only interesting,
      and not bogus.<br /><br />Are there any other reasons why these two L2 addresses
      wouldn&#39;t match?

  html: Hey Ivan,<br /><br />At the risk of sounding pedantic...<br /><br />*Any*
    frame with a multicast source MAC address is illegal, not just those frames containing
    ARP replies. See 802.3 sections 2.3.1.2 and 2.3.2.2.<br /><br />Strictly speaking,
    what you&#39;re referring to here is the &quot;hardware address of sender&quot;
    in the ARP reply payload described by RFC 826, not the source hardware address.<br
    /><br />Usually these two addresses (the one in the ARP payload, and the one in
    the frame header) are the same, but I&#39;m not aware of any requirement that
    they match.

  html: The Opcode field in the ARP Message specifies the nature of the ARP message.
    If it is 1, then the message is ARP request and if it is 2 then it is ARP reply.<br
    /><br />When the ARP request is sent (with opcode as 1, for sure ARP request is
    a broadcast as everyone in the local network should get it) the ARP header is
    filled with 3 important values along with other and they are <br /><br />1) Target
    IP Address<br />2) Source IP Address<br />3) Source MAC address<br /><br />Target
    MAC address should be empty, because that is what the source machine is trying
    to find out. Ideally source MAC address cannot be a <br />multicast MAC address
    and it is illegal.<br /><br />But, Microsoft NLB (Network Load Balancing) and
    Fail-over Server Clusters require special type of addressing configuration since
    clusters contain more than one computer.

    the ideal situation because they are looking to only to solve their problems and
    how make their software work. <br /><br />Thanks a lot for your wonderful tech
