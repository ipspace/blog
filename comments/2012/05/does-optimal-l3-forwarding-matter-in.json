I feel bad for all the people that need to support vMotion on their network. As the South Park meme states, &quot;You&#39;re gonna have a bad time&quot; if you try to scale it out. http://qkme.me/3p631g<br /><br />L3 TOR will typically provide much better flow hashing than glbp/hsrp/vrrp. You get per flow hashing and not per host hashing. It is also easier to go more than 2 wide above your TORs with L3 vs L2. Troubleshooting L3 is much saner than trying to troubleshoot evil protocols like virtual port-channels.<br /><br />Optimal forwarding is nice. I see L3 as orthogonal  to firewalls and load balancers, at least at scale.<br /><br />If you are talking about a &quot;datacenter&quot; with a few dozen racks where all the config is hand managed, it probably doesn&#39;t matter. If you&#39;re network is small enough that a single engineer can hand manage it, stunt networking with vPC and vlans everywhere won&#39;t be an issue. Until you try grow it out by an order of magnitude. Then you&#39;ll be screwed.<br /><br />IMHO",

      "html": "This is an interesting discussion that we have thought  about recently when we decided to build a few data centers to consolidate many DCs handling 15K apps. VM and HP&#39;s equivalent were to support  80% of these apps. <br /><br />2 DCs are paired by DWDM and short distances to be able to accommodate capacities in excess of 100 Gbps and low latencies for whatever FC or Ethernet based replications people want to do. <br /><br />At each DC we have a lan core of 2xN7Ks, end of row of 2xN5Ks for every row, and the N2Ks FECs for the top of rack which connect to blade/chassis based switches. So, many port channels and many trunks everywhere.<br /><br />Naturally, the biggest point of disagreement between the server/application teams and the network team was the border between L2 and L3. Ultimately, we brought L2 back to the lan core. To the other DC, rest of the Wan, load balancing infrastructure, or services on the other side of firewalls, we route at L3. <br /><br />Suboptimal forwarding performance, within the L2/L3 switched lan environment, is less a concern to us, than the performance limitations we have when traversing our firewalls, IPSs, or Wan. Even when packets or frames need to come back to the core, we are probably looking microseconds of additional delay versus milliseconds of delay. <br /><br />Another important consideration for us, is routing into and out of the pair of data centers requiring symmetry for wan optimization and security. This forced a certain level of suboptimal routing into the design.<br /><br />Another reader mentioned simplicity of design. In my opinion, this is even more critical than sub-optimal routing to the performance of a data center within the data center. If only high level engineers can troubleshoot and resolve issues, due to the complexities of the data center, then the time to resolution increases substantially as there are generally fewer of these engineers around. <br /><br />The only caveat is that the uplinks and hardware has the capacity to be able to forward the traffic.",

      "html": "I hate to give this answer, but: It depends.<br /><br />Given the typical tools of VLAN and VRF, many datacenters would find that VRF support is lacking and/or burdensome to support in access and aggregation tiers. So VLANs make more sense, bridging at the access/agg with routing happening in the &quot;core&quot; or WAN edge. Of course, this also gives a larger broadcast domain and might facilitate mobility, plug and play behaviors, etc.<br /><br />As to traffic patterns: If we&#39;re using VRFs for  the routing edge, then maybe it doesn&#39;t matter - if the VRFs are supporting different VPNs then inter-VLAN traffic isn&#39;t likely anyway. On the other hand, if each VRF is routing (e.g. locally) between multiple VLANs then you get a traffic trombone. It&#39;s not very efficient of course, in terms of capacity etc, but even a &quot;traffic trombone&quot; is possibly a good tradeoff in terms of centralizing the VRF capability and configuration. And as you point out, we may have this traffic pattern anyway because of e.g. the location of the security edge (firewall) or load-balancer.<br /><br />In other environments, VRF support may not be necessary for L3, e.g. because we&#39;re attaching everything to &quot;the Internet&quot; or some other common network. In that case, it might make more sense to route in the access and/or aggregation layer. Plain L3 routing is more likely to be supported in various equipment, and it&#39;s somewhat easier to manage.<br /><br />And we can always run both L2 and L3 throughout the datacenter - L3 on the access node for routing to the Internet and L2 for carrying traffic to centralized VRF PEs, or something like that. You can probably imagine other ways to combine these; the point is that each design will be judged based on the purpose / goal of the datacenter, so there&#39;s probably no &quot;one size fits all&quot; answer here.<br /><br />Of course, all of this might become moot with overlays and SDN architectures. At some point, the underlying network can be all-L3 and the &quot;service&quot; can be a mix of L2 and L3. Depending on how much control is built into the control plane, we might be able to do interesting policy and non-traditional forwarding... But that&#39;s a topic for another day. :)",
