    html: I did not quite get what Chip said that when 2 10G links are in the same
      ASIC port group, then VCS can essentially make it a 20G bandwidth link and do
      per-packet load balancing, in this case how VCS control plane is going to treat
      this 20G link for SPF calculation and how to ECMP traffic over this 20G link?

    html: VCS treats a per-packet trunk as a single physical link. Think about it
      as a L1 LAG. Any protocol running on top of that will treat it as a single link.

  html: Very nice presentations and discussions (3rd video), your first question with
    regarding to how to distribute traffic over fatter pipes, I think VCS control
    plane only has knowledge of individual links, i.e. there is no LAG/EthernetChannel
    pe se inside the fabric, so traffic will be hashed to all available links regardless
    whether the link is to the same next hop switch or different nexthop switch. Regarding
    your second question about vPC/vLAG toward split fabric, I don&#39;t think fabric
    itself has mechanism to decide which fabric should take over when this happens,
    if other side vPC/vLAG device can not detect the fabric failure (most likely they
    cannot), then there will be a broken L2.

  html: Actually, that&#39;s DR. Chip Copper to be politically correct :)<br /><br
    /><br />I just wrote up a long drawn out explanation of the questions above, but
    decided it was way too much info.<br /><br />Let&#39;s just say, ECMP takes care
    of getting from switch to switch and Brocade&#39;s fantastic hashing algorithm
    takes care of the load balancing. <br /><br />This technology works. I have this
    implemented in large production data centers and is supporting tens of thousands
    of VMs, physical servers, and entire tier 1 applications. <br /><br />The only
    thing I wish Brocade would do is document the increased performance just about
    all customers have seen using VDX switches in the SAME TOPOLOGY as their older
    10g ethernet gear. <br /><br />VDX has increased performance 3x-4x on applications
    and NAS clusters just based on the losslessness and load balancing inherent to
    the system in the SAME EXACT TOPOLOGY as the older gear with no secret sauce at
    all!!!! These have been documented by my customers, and it&#39;s my customers
    that are evangelizing this technology for me!<br /><br />Next 2 years should be
    GREAT with VDX!!!
