    html: With 5msec RTT and almost no loss, the theoretical TCP throughput is above
      200 GBps. http://www.switch.ch/network/tools/tcp_throughput/index.html<br /><br
      />I had 15 Gbps iperf flow between two VMs in the same hypervisor host, and
      the limit was the CPU/vSwitch, not the TCP performance.

  html: 'One question: is it possible to have a 30gbps TCP flow? (not unidirectionally
    generated with a packet generator, but an actual flow). Wouldn&#39;t RTT/Windowsize
    limitations kick in, even with minimal delay between hosts?'

    html: There&#39;s absolutely nothing special (apart from the secret-sauce load
      balancing on a single port group), the point of the second half of the post
      is that you can&#39;t win against a broken design no matter what you do.

    html: According to Linux documentation, you should be able to get more than 10
      Gbps over a pair of 10 Gbps uplinks. Not tested by yours truly though.

  html: '&quot;You need a server with multiple NICs configured in round-robin bonding
    mode to generate a TCP flow larger than 10Gbps.&quot;<br /><br />You may have
    just blown my mind....Even if the server has a 10Gb uplink?'

      balancing&quot; link in the article.

    html: Thanks for the pointer. I hope that&#39;s not a new trend -- having to read
      patents for documentation :-) The described solution of measuring link skew
      to do perfect transmit scheduling and thereby avoiding the need for receiver-side
      re-ordering seems almost too good to be true. Kudos to them if they really pulled
      than one off.

    html: Anonymous, we&#39;ve been doing it for over 10 years in the Fibre Channel
      space, there&#39;s really no new revolutionary technology in the way we do frame-based
      load balancing in VCS... :)

  html: If you configure the three links in round-robin mode, wouldn&#39;t you run
    the risk of packet re-ordering issues (see http://kb.pert.geant.net/PERTKB/PacketReordering)

    html: Funny ... the documentation is mentioning &quot;per-packet&quot; load sharing,
      but no command to configure it. I would guess it&#39;s another mismatch between
      marketing and reality.
