    html: IPv6 uses L2 multicast instead of L2 broadcast. Multicast and broadcast
      frames are flooded in the same way (unless the switches use IGMP and/or MLD
      snooping, in which case they can limit IPv4 and/or IPv6 multicast flooding),
      and the impact on hypervisors would be the same.<br /><br />To get full benefits
      of IPv6 ND, you need switches with MLD snooping.

  html: How will IPv6 help (or hinder) the flooding of BUM frames? With IPv6 using
    ND multicast frames instead of ARP broadcasts, won&#39;t this help to some degree,
    similarly to VXLAN flooding over IP multicast?
