There are countless links and videos out there, from Google directly, that give you insight into how our servers, datacenters, &amp; networks operate. Obviously, we can&#39;t give you every single detail, and no one else will either.<br /><br />- We have one of the most challenging environments, because when you operate at the scale we do, no one out there can provide services to meet the needs, so we end up having to be the solution ourselves. We have to come up with ways to do things that no one else can, and to do that, you need resources, so yes, we have a lot of talent in-house, but it&#39;s not that these engineers are that much better than anyone else - it&#39;s that they are highly motivated and want to push their limits and do things that no one else is doing. You sound like someone that didn&#39;t make it through the interviews and are disgruntled. Get over it and try again.<br /><br />- Of course we&#39;re not going to share our own intellectual property if that is what is giving us a competitive advantage to the Bings and Baidus and Yahoos and Facebooks. To expect Google, or anyone for that matter, to give up all of our trade secrets is just plain stupid and demonstrative that you have no idea how this industry really works or how businesses actually make money.",

      "html": "Ivan, Good post, many smart points. Still, I differ slightly on a few. You hint that perhaps Google&#39;s actions will &quot;persuade hardware vendors and chipset manufacturers to implement more OpenFlow capabilities&quot;. Hmm. Maybe, but chipsets are not the barrier, as demonstrated by Google&#39;s use of off-the-shelf chips. The question is, will (&quot;hardware&quot;) vendors add software support for some open control manipulation protocol. (Probably we should say &quot;system&quot; vendors, but nobody does.) And does OpenFlow matter? As you say, they need to manipulate control state somehow. Google could have used a proprietary protocol, but they wanted to demonstrate that there was a viable open protocol, so seems like choice of OpenFlow offers an existence proof that some problems can be solved using an open control state manipulation protocol (it&#39;s not like there are dozens). As for &quot;Will someone else repeat their feat and bring a low-cost high-end router to the market?&quot;, how can you bring that box to market if there are no controller vendors highlighting that application? One might imagine that Google itself is the market, but how many will buy that argument?",
