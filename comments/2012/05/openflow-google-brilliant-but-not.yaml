  html: These slides may provide more hints on how to build an open LSR that uses
    Quagga as the routing engine and NetFPGA as the forwarding plane:<br />http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog50/presentations/Monday/NANOG50.Talk17.swhyte_Opensource_LSR_Presentation.pdf<br
    /><br />While the pdf slides from ONS are unfortunately not available online,
    here is a 10 min lightning talk that pretty much summarizes the OpenFlow-based
    G-Scale backbone using open-source control plane (Quagga BGP, IS-IS) running in
    centralized servers:<br />https://ripe64.ripe.net/archives/video/884/<br /><br
    />For those interested in such split router designs based on Quagga (or any Linux-based
    routing engine) running in commodity servers and downloading the FIBs to OpenFlow
    hardware, here is the open-source RouteFlow project (shameless plug):<br />https://sites.google.com/site/routeflow/

    html: It&#39;s being used by millions of people, second after second - you just
      can&#39;t interact with it and you never will be able to. OpenFlow is not a
      customer-facing technology, it&#39;s a network engineering technology that is
      intended to improve how we manage and operate networks, and how they function.
      What it is not is something that your customers should ever interact with.

  html: Whatever they did, it&#39;s not exposed to the world yet. You only find the
    true results once millions of people start using it.<br /><br />People just have
    the habit of bashing Cisco and Microsoft. <br /><br />Mac used to glorify themselves
    in many such conferences and now when they got the market, 500000+ macs just got
    infected. <br /><br />you can certainly bash others to get into the market. Unfortunately,
    thats how the world works.

    html: You are seriously off-base here on several points:<br /><br />- Google is
      very transparent, and I actually challenge you to show me where Cisco or Juniper
      or Brocade or HP or anyone else will ever tell you even one small piece of how
      their internal networks are built. There are countless links and videos out
      there, from Google directly, that give you insight into how our servers, datacenters,
      &amp; networks operate. Obviously, we can&#39;t give you every single detail,
      and no one else will either.<br /><br />- We have one of the most challenging
      environments, because when you operate at the scale we do, no one out there
      can provide services to meet the needs, so we end up having to be the solution
      ourselves. We have to come up with ways to do things that no one else can, and
      to do that, you need resources, so yes, we have a lot of talent in-house, but
      it&#39;s not that these engineers are that much better than anyone else - it&#39;s
      that they are highly motivated and want to push their limits and do things that
      no one else is doing. You sound like someone that didn&#39;t make it through
      the interviews and are disgruntled. Get over it and try again.<br /><br />-
      Of course we&#39;re not going to share our own intellectual property if that
      is what is giving us a competitive advantage to the Bings and Baidus and Yahoos
      and Facebooks. To expect Google, or anyone for that matter, to give up all of
      our trade secrets is just plain stupid and demonstrative that you have no idea
      how this industry really works or how businesses actually make money.

    html: Precisely...Thats because of Google and similar cos secrecy that SDN will
      become VDN (Vendor defined Network)....and that will hurt SDN on the whole...differing
      and closed implementations will not serve the cause and will give tradtional
      cos like Cisco/Juni a heads up in getting market segments of their own.<br /><br
      />Me thinks SDN will be used more by CLOUD providers and ISP rather than Enterprises.....and
      will be operated in silos....what if these Google SDN stars decide to move on?

  html: Thanks Ivan for commenting the PR - I agree with the views from this article.<br
    /><br />When Google will become as transparent as others, that&#39;s when I will
    consider a new era...<br /><br />They have one of the least challenging environment
    in the world, i.e. almost unlimited resources, access to the most talented engineers
    (along with their ego ;-)) but share almost nothing of their own dev.<br /><br
    />Now one would wonder if it is because the applicability of what they develop
    is just unique to Google, especially this massive use of TE... application is
    what drives Google dev, I think this use case of OF is just a confirmation to
    me.

    html: As always, you&#39;re spot-on. The problem OpenFlow is facing today is lack
      of commercial-grade controllers (apart from Nicira&#39;s NVP), and Google solved
      it for their internal use. Will someone else productize something similar? That
      would be interesting ...

  html: Ivan, Good post, many smart points. Still, I differ slightly on a few. You
    hint that perhaps Google&#39;s actions will &quot;persuade hardware vendors and
    chipset manufacturers to implement more OpenFlow capabilities&quot;. Hmm. Maybe,
    but chipsets are not the barrier, as demonstrated by Google&#39;s use of off-the-shelf
    chips. The question is, will (&quot;hardware&quot;) vendors add software support
    for some open control manipulation protocol. (Probably we should say &quot;system&quot;
    vendors, but nobody does.) And does OpenFlow matter? As you say, they need to
    manipulate control state somehow. Google could have used a proprietary protocol,
    but they wanted to demonstrate that there was a viable open protocol, so seems
    like choice of OpenFlow offers an existence proof that some problems can be solved
    using an open control state manipulation protocol (it&#39;s not like there are
    dozens). As for &quot;Will someone else repeat their feat and bring a low-cost
    high-end router to the market?&quot;, how can you bring that box to market if
    there are no controller vendors highlighting that application? One might imagine
    that Google itself is the market, but how many will buy that argument?

      it&#39;s more of a &quot;revelation&quot; that someone actually did something

  html: The revolution is that it went beyond all the OpenFlow &quot;hype&quot; and
    actually put it into some kind of action. The market is flooded with people talking
    about OpenFlow and SDN, but the practicality of it is beyond the reach of most
    enterprises and networks out there. That could be because of hardware limitations,
    but I feel the more realistic limitation is in the engineer&#39;s ability to actually
    come up with a useful scenario for trying to fit OpenFlow into existing environments.

  html: Average link utilisation above 90% would imply that is in working case (i.e.
    average) conditions, which would also imply &gt;100% link utilisation (unless
    they load balance over more than 10 parallel paths) in failure cases.  It&#39;s
    not that you can&#39;t run networks today with link utilisations above 90% but
    that in practise most providers plan for failure cases hence the average util
    is &lt;90% by implication.

    html: The MPLS TE problems are best described in the RIPE64 video I&#39;ve linked
      to in the note in the article. Tunnel packing (or, more general, knapsack problem)
      is just one of them.<br /><br />Thanks for the MPLS-TP note. I know NMS is not
      mandatory, but it&#39;s interesting to see MPLS-TP moving in that same direction
      (actually, it&#39;s moving in all directions at once, but let&#39;s not go there
      ;) )
