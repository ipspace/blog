          "html": "IPv6 uses L2 multicast instead of L2 broadcast. Multicast and broadcast frames are flooded in the same way (unless the switches use IGMP and/or MLD snooping, in which case they can limit IPv4 and/or IPv6 multicast flooding), and the impact on hypervisors would be the same.<br /><br />To get full benefits of IPv6 ND, you need switches with MLD snooping.",
