  html: Will, stateless firewalls doesn&#39;t care about symmetric routing. Load balancers
    typically do, but they&#39;re close to the servers (which has state anyway).<br
    /><br />What I want to avoid is centralised state in the network itself - the
    data center network is shared between multiple customers, and I don&#39;t want
    any stateful devices in the shared infrastructure for reliability and performance
    reasons. That there&#39;s state kept inside a single customer&#39;s infrastructure
    is unavoidable, but if a DoS attack fills the state tables in a single customer&#39;s
    load balancer, other customers are unaffected. If the attack fills the state tables
    for a centralised NAT44 solution, *every* customer is affected.<br /><br />Tore

  html: I&#39;m not sure to understand why ASR1K is not able to do 1:1 static translation
    (NAT46)...  This IOS XE command:<br /><br />nat64 v6v4 static 2001:ABCD:100::2
    199.1.1.3<br /><br />should translate a destination 199.1.1.3 to 2001:ABCD:100::1
    isn&#39;t ?  I&#39;m, for sure, missing something...<br /><br />Regards,

    html: Thank you Tore.  I didn&#39;t realize that stateful was involved with a
      static nat64 statement that should be &quot;stateless only&quot; from my point
      of view...  I totally agree with you.<br /><br />Best regards,

  html: Martin B, in my testing i found that this command would do the static mapping
    I wanted. However, it invokes stateful mode - the source address will be mapped
    into the prefix defined by &quot;nat64 prefix stateful&quot;, and all flows show
    up in the output of &quot;show nat64 translations&quot;.<br /><br />I would very
    much like to see a feature that did the exact same thing for stateless mode. Adding
    the IPv4-translatable addresses to the servers, and static routes to them on the
    server&#39;s default gateways, importing them into the IGP ... I don&#39;t *like*
    this solution - it just works for a proof of concept test. For a production deployment,
    it would be much better (less hassle and complexity) to have a list of static
    mappings pushed to all the translators, and do nothing special with the servers
    or their access routers.<br /><br />Tore
