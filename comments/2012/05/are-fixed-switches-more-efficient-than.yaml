  html: Actually, if you stick with the single-trident-chip 64-port switches like
    the Arista 7050S-64, you an do the same sort of Clos fabric with just 125W per
    switch. You&#39;d need 12 edge switches and 6 spine switches. The power works
    out to &lt;6W per port &quot;typical&quot; according to the Arista spec sheet.<br
    /><br />Again you have an issue of 32 ports divided by 6 spine switches, but since
    it&#39;s statistically non-blocking, that should&#39;t matter too much, and the
    ECMP won&#39;t care if some of the links terminate on the same spine switch.<br
    /><br />You can argue that there would be a cabling mess, but I would suspect
    it would be less so than trying to run 384 fibers into one rack from all over
    the datacenter. With the 1U solution, the edge ports are distributed short copper,
    without expensive optics. MPO ribbon fibers and patch panels would be used from
    leaf to spine just as they would with 40G connectors to cut down on the number
    of cables needed, and you would probably divide the spine switches into just two
    locations in the DC.<br /><br />The real benefit of the 1U solution is being able
    to adjust the number of leafs and spines you need based on actual traffic patterns,
    oversubscribing at the edge where that makes economic sense. You don&#39;t have
    that same flexibility with $350k+ chassis solutions (remember you need *two* of
    those beasts for redundancy).

  html: 'Let&#39;s redefine &quot;fixed&quot; as &quot;single-chip&quot; boxes, as
    it this is normally their biggest benefit (though not all fixed boxes are single
    chip, of course). Take the trident chip to build a 32x32=1024 port fabric: you
    will need 32+16 devices. There are some &quot;packaging&quot; games when doing
    all those scale-out fabrics, so for ease of breakout we want to pick up the number
    of switches based on switch radix.<br /><br />Let&#39;s pick up 7050S or Nexus
    3064X, which use trident&#39;s integrated phy&#39;s to yield typical power draw
    in the range 120-130W. The resulting cost per &quot;front panel&quot; port will
    be significantly lower as compared to a chassis box (unfortunately, I can&#39;t
    give the exact pricing, but one can get very good numbers for fixed boxes, especially
    when buying in quantities). Furthermore, the power draw per &quot;front port&quot;
    will be around 18*130/384=6W. <br /><br />Downside - lot&#39;s of boxes and wiring,
    but that the price you have to pay :) Managing this many boxes is not that difficult,
    provided that automated provisioning/monitoring and remediation system is in place.
    <br /><br />Conclusion - using single-chip boxes makes sense when building cheap
    larger fabrics. This being said, we should remember that number of links in butterfly/clos
    grows following the power low with the base of switch radix and power of number
    of stages. At some point you would rather increase switch radix than add another
    stage. So let&#39;s wait for Trident2 device to hit the market.'

  html: Well, lower power consumption means lower cost. But what about one time setup
    fees and service (hardware+software) support contracts?<br /><br />Many vendors
    offer better standard hardware warranties on their non-chassis switches, sometime
    offer basic software updates for free on some of their products. service contract
    costs are sometimes way lower on stackables. TCO can be lower<br /><br />e.g.
    HP<br /><br />- Have you ever configured a A10500 with service contracts? Instead
    take a look at the A58XX series...

  html: Use TOR to build a clos network is not even close to chassis based fabric.<br
    />Chasis based solution is more expensive, mainly due to the voq design.<br />I
    wonder if fix switch only can support massive data flow?

  html: Given that the Arista 7508 draws 10W per port (per the data sheet) as opposed
    to 18W per Brad - I would err on the side of the data sheet, 40% less power...<br
    /><br />(Average power draw under 50% load at 25C ambient is 3800W/loaded Arista
    7508)

  html: fixed switches offer higher port density and lower per-port power consumption
    than chassis-based ones  However, the relevant message here is that Fixed switches
    are faster to market with higher speed interfaces than chassis switches and customers
    can benefit from that.

    of 1G LAN ports?
