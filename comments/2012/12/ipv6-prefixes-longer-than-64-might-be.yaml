    html: Absolutely agree ... but if those prefixes then leak into the DC, you have
      an interesting challenge ;)

  html: 'i think i&#39;d add something like &quot;in l3 switches/dc&quot; to the topic,
    coz for example, with /64 on the peering interfaces between two border routers
    you can have some nasty ipv6 nd miss issues. '

    html: Actually, according to the RFC, routers MUST support /127 for p2p links
      if they want to be compliant with 6164. <br /><br />The security implications
      of /64&#39;s are legitimate and it&#39;s pretty disappointing to see that the
      use of &gt; /64 prefixes are harmful due to the *hardware* implementation and
      TCAM resources rather than actual harm with the protocol. <br /><br />I doubt
      there&#39;s any saving older hardware so here&#39;s hoping that future gear
      is built with adequate lookup resources for both v4 AND v6.

    html: I&#39;m positive (but have no hard data) most switches I mentioned above
      do support /127s with CPU-based switching. As long as the amount of traffic
      forwarded to those prefixes is low, you&#39;ll do just fine.

    html: '&quot;As long as the amount of traffic forwarded to those prefixes is low&quot;
      -- doesn&#39;t that mean you&#39;re vulnerable to DoS by hosts able to send
      to those prefixes? Eliminating that risk was the point of using /127 in the
      first place...<br /><br />Plus, that would allow DoSing any router in the path
      from the host to the /127, as opposed to the ping-pong or ND-exhaustion attacks
      that only affect the routers directly attached to the PtP link.<br /><br />It
      still sounds like the only real solution is to put ACLs on to restrict traffic
      to PtP subnets to management hosts only. Then you can use whatever prefix length
      you want (which should be /64 without these other concerns).'

  html: Putting /64 or any other prefix lengths into the light of TCAM clockworks
    is an interesting point. Vendors need to somehow hack their ways around own hardware
    limitations, could this be one of the reasons for pushing /64s almost everywhere?
    (Weee, conspiracy theory! :-) )

  html: My understanding of /127s is that unfortunately Juniper has an ASIC issue
    which makes equipment using it susceptible to ping-pong attacks.  To address this
    they came out with /127s.  So for Juniper equipment with this issue, /127s make
    sense.  However, if you&#39;re using other equipment I would consider sticking
    with /64s.  Using all /64s makes things easier - no subnetting.  Don&#39;t just
    think of network engineers but help desk and non-network people.  Also, if your
    &quot;point-to-point&quot; link gets migrated to a MetroEthernet type setup you
    may wish to add more nodes to that &quot;point-to-point&quot; link.  Wouldn&#39;t
    it be nice if it was a /64 so it wasn&#39;t an issue?  IPv6 address space is unimaginably
    big so conservation is no longer necessary or desirable.  I&#39;m not saying you
    shouldn&#39;t use /127s, but I am saying think about the flexibility and simplicity
    you&#39;re giving up but using them.  If you do use /127s you may still want to
    reserve a /64 just in case you change your mind later.

  html: Why are people putting global unicast space on internal transit interfaces
    exposing an attack surface necessitating the /64 vs /127 arguement?<br /><br />I
    deploy exactly 2 IPv6 configurations, one is 6VPE which is incredibly effective
    and reliable, the other is traditional BGP ipv6 unicast for host prefix information
    and OSPFv3 for loopback reachability within the AS. Both setups function fantastically
    and expose zero internal infrastructure to attack through the use of iacls and
    link-local addressing.<br /><br />IPv6 is not IPv4, and the way you go about building
    traditional IPv4 networks with big edge firewalls between the internet and the
    internal systems does NOT work well from a high-availability or effective-security-posture
    perspective.<br /><br />With IPv6, your network is now part of the internet, like
    it or not. Many of the poor design decisions set to color the industry for the
    next decade+ will be the result of trying to force ipv6 into the ipv4 paradigm
    unsuccessfully.

    html: If you&#39;ve got good OOB access to all your routers then that should be
      fine. Without good OOB it can be valuable to be able to access a router if routing
      is only working properly up to one hop away from it.

  html: Do we really need to use these prefixes on the interconnects? I mean in the
    internal network IGP will work fine with only link-local addresses, wouldn&#39;t
    it? And the routing table will be smaller.
