  html: as you mentioned &quot;the network LSA generated by B2 will stay in the database
    for a while&quot;.. but not forever, as I counted it went up to 60 seconds before
    that LSA has been deleted

  html: I have confirmed that the LSA is being MaxAged out, but I can&#39;t put my
    finger on why this is taking a solid 60 seconds to happen. <br /><br />I did see
    that OSPF is remembering the old DR on the link as I issue the &#39;ip ospf priority
    0&#39; command. And it&#39;s not until the router, through the use of a debug,
    &#39;Reset old DR on Fa0/0&#39;. But the question is, what timer is being used
    to keep that entry for 60 seconds?<br /><br />I did some light digging, but I
    can&#39;t seem to find an answer immediately. I&#39;m sure its something simple
    that I&#39;m overlooking, but I will dig some more when I get some free time.<br
