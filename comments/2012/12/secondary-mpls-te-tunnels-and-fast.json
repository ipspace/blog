      "html": "Generally yes, we dont need it but most networks use TE for its excellent applications.<br />FRR is a very temporary path, backup/standby -non-signalled tunnels are good to have a deterministic path in case of primary tunnel failure (deterministic by tools such as affinity vs dynamic LSPs). As well as granular traffic forwarding in case of CBTS/PBTS, and/or Auto-bandwidth and its pipe usage restrictions. You may need multiple LSPs for Auto-bandwidth to work precisely and you could bring your backup tunnels into the calculation once they are active.",

      "html": "One application where secondary tunnels are needed is SS7/Sigtran which basically carry critical call signaling between an operators signaling components. These services typically have an A and B path. The key requirement is to have complete transport diversity for these 2 paths, to be able to handle underlying IP transport DEGRADES. Note: IP link failures, can be handled by FRR convergence. But the a link degrade (bit errors etc,), needs to be handled by the application. And that&#39;s where the signaling diversity falls into play. ",

With BFD triggering this allows the magic sub-50ms (which is needed in some utility networks) without needing larger more expensive aggregation routers.",
