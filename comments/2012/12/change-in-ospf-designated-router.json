      "html": "I have confirmed that the LSA is being MaxAged out, but I can&#39;t put my finger on why this is taking a solid 60 seconds to happen. <br /><br />I did see that OSPF is remembering the old DR on the link as I issue the &#39;ip ospf priority 0&#39; command. And it&#39;s not until the router, through the use of a debug, &#39;Reset old DR on Fa0/0&#39;. But the question is, what timer is being used to keep that entry for 60 seconds?<br /><br />I did some light digging, but I can&#39;t seem to find an answer immediately. I&#39;m sure its something simple that I&#39;m overlooking, but I will dig some more when I get some free time.<br />",
