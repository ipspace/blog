Eliminating that risk was the point of using /127 in the first place...<br /><br />Plus, that would allow DoSing any router in the path from the host to the /127, as opposed to the ping-pong or ND-exhaustion attacks that only affect the routers directly attached to the PtP link.<br /><br />It still sounds like the only real solution is to put ACLs on to restrict traffic to PtP subnets to management hosts only. Then you can use whatever prefix length you want (which should be /64 without these other concerns).",

      "html": "My understanding of /127s is that unfortunately Juniper has an ASIC issue which makes equipment using it susceptible to ping-pong attacks.  To address this they came out with /127s.  So for Juniper equipment with this issue, /127s make sense.  However, if you&#39;re using other equipment I would consider sticking with /64s.  Using all /64s makes things easier - no subnetting.  Don&#39;t just think of network engineers but help desk and non-network people.  Also, if your &quot;point-to-point&quot; link gets migrated to a MetroEthernet type setup you may wish to add more nodes to that &quot;point-to-point&quot; link.  Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if it was a /64 so it wasn&#39;t an issue?  IPv6 address space is unimaginably big so conservation is no longer necessary or desirable.  I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t use /127s, but I am saying think about the flexibility and simplicity you&#39;re giving up but using them.  If you do use /127s you may still want to reserve a /64 just in case you change your mind later.",

      "html": "Why are people putting global unicast space on internal transit interfaces exposing an attack surface necessitating the /64 vs /127 arguement?<br /><br />I deploy exactly 2 IPv6 configurations, one is 6VPE which is incredibly effective and reliable, the other is traditional BGP ipv6 unicast for host prefix information and OSPFv3 for loopback reachability within the AS. Both setups function fantastically and expose zero internal infrastructure to attack through the use of iacls and link-local addressing.<br /><br />IPv6 is not IPv4, and the way you go about building traditional IPv4 networks with big edge firewalls between the internet and the internal systems does NOT work well from a high-availability or effective-security-posture perspective.<br /><br />With IPv6, your network is now part of the internet, like it or not. Many of the poor design decisions set to color the industry for the next decade+ will be the result of trying to force ipv6 into the ipv4 paradigm unsuccessfully.",
