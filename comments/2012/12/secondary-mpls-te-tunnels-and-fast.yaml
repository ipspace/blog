    html: Unless you engineer the secondary LSP, it will go over the same set of links
      as the primary, so what&#39;s the use case?

    html: By default Junos will try to put a secondary &quot;standby&quot; LSP on
      a different path from the primary LSP.

  html: Generally I would say that FRR takes care of the packets that are on their
    way down the LSP which is actually broken further down the path.<br /><br />The
    standby secondary LSP will get the next packet after the ingress LSR receives
    the PathErr.<br /><br />You may chose to &quot;TE&quot; the secondary LSP, or
    not, and you may put bandwidth requirement on it, or not, etc.<br /><br />I think
    FRR and a standby is complimentary, and if you do not chose to engineer the standby
    there is no much overhead. It is all in the same &#39;apply-group&#39;...

  html: As pg said, secondary MPLS-TE tunnels could be used to carry different QoS
    requirements then the primary.<br />It may be useful to shutdown the primary instance
    and switch to secondary with lower bandwidth in some cases - even though it goes
    on the same set of links as the primary.<br />

  html: Generally yes, we dont need it but most networks use TE for its excellent
    applications.<br />FRR is a very temporary path, backup/standby -non-signalled
    tunnels are good to have a deterministic path in case of primary tunnel failure
    (deterministic by tools such as affinity vs dynamic LSPs). As well as granular
    traffic forwarding in case of CBTS/PBTS, and/or Auto-bandwidth and its pipe usage
    restrictions. You may need multiple LSPs for Auto-bandwidth to work precisely
    and you could bring your backup tunnels into the calculation once they are active.

  html: 'One application where secondary tunnels are needed is SS7/Sigtran which basically
    carry critical call signaling between an operators signaling components. These
    services typically have an A and B path. The key requirement is to have complete
    transport diversity for these 2 paths, to be able to handle underlying IP transport
    DEGRADES. Note: IP link failures, can be handled by FRR convergence. But the a
    link degrade (bit errors etc,), needs to be handled by the application. And that&#39;s
    where the signaling diversity falls into play. '

  html: The smaller more predictable LFIB compared to FRR when using secondary paths
    on LSPs is favourable when looking at access and aggregation routers.  With BFD
    triggering this allows the magic sub-50ms (which is needed in some utility networks)
    without needing larger more expensive aggregation routers.
