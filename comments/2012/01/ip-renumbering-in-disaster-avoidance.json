DNS doesn&#39;t help the firewalls much.<br />- reconfiguring the VM&#39;s IP is easy (VMware SRM does this), but reconfiguring application listen directives (think apache config file) is not easy. lots of custom per-application scripting work is required.<br /><br />Vendors like to claim their offerings are turn-key DR. Customers who believe it will be disappointed :-)",

      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />In terms of the listed solutions:<br />1. DNS - customers complain about the reaction time. On the other hand disaster recovery does not require fast detection and a DNS refresh.<br />2. Hosts routes - harder to manage. LISP will be a good choice but it is emerging technology and more time is required.<br />3. Routing protocols on servers not an option at this moment but in the virtualized DC it is feasible. We can have not only firewalls, load-balancers, switches but also routing protocols running on the hipervisor.<br />4. Load-Balancers seem to be the best option listed. The global director or simply a router with a conditional route advertisement can do a prefix insertion.<br />5. NAT harder to manage and consumes resources unless the stateless translation is used. NAT is better to avoid not because it will not work but to leave it as the last resort solution in the case of problems to IPv6 migration.<br /><br />Another options:<br />6. Proxy ARP + L3 Edge. There are some security drawbacks especially if a firewall is in between but it is considerable.<br />7. Fabric-Path/TRILL for IP. In this option DC is fully L3 routed. There is no such standards nowadays but we could create it. ;)",

With a disaster recovery DC it is also an option. The secondary LB + edge router start advertising VIP prefixes after a switchover button is pushed. <br /><br />3. It is not an option not because there is no routing on servers but because IPs of GWs are fixed.  <br /><br />6. The funny thing Proxy ARP is shown by the Cisco BU as a part of the LISP solution in the case of IP address movement. That&#39;s right that Proxy ARP solves only to-GW problem but from this point there is pure L3 network with the conditional advertisements/IP SLA/PfR and so on.<br /><br />7. By saying &#39;Fabric-Path/TRILL for IP&#39; I did not mean the existing feature. I will rephrase it in an another way. Imagine that a network of switches compose a topology based on Switch-IDs. This network behaves like L3 not STP. After connecting a host/server with IP this address will be advertised to other participants which require a connectivity. In such a way we could achieve a full mobility of IPs which will have /128 address. Hosts do not need to use GWs as all links could be point-to-point to the nearest SW.",

      "html": "LISP seems like a good solution for VM mobility, very much like LAM in concept for the DC but obviously a more complicated protocol involving dynamic tunnelling. However the tunneling aspect surely means that added functionality is needed in the DC firewalls between security zones as they cannot yet inspect this traffic before it gets to the ETR which is directly conencted to the subnet that the VM is on.<br /><br />I&#39;m struggling with this part because I believe LISP would solve a big problem, but we would need the firewall to have LISP intelligence to see inside the LISP packet. Maybe this is coming too.",

      "html": "What do you think about trying to use static routes pointing out of the interface without a next-hop? A static route configured without a next-hop pointing out of an ethernet interface will still cause the device to ARP for hosts. It gives the benefit over a connected route in that you can still control administrative distance of the static route. You can add your host subnet this way with a higher Administrative Distance then redistribute the static route into BGP. You can then strip the weight and set the Local Preference and do all sorts of fun things to it in BGP so even a received BGP route for the same subnet will be preferred over the route on the local device but you can advertise it as a backup. This would allow you to prefer your primary datacenter over the backup even from backup datacenter&#39;s router / firewall itself... so long as you have a better route received from BGP from the primary datacenter.<br /><br />This works for the host subnet route but for the gateway address for that subnet, depending on the hardware, you may be able to:<br />1) Use proxy-arp for the specific gateway address only, if this is supported. Some gear will let you specify the host addresses themselves you want to proxy arp for. If you have equipment that can do this it is nice (some equipment will not even require an IP on the interface to do this, if it does require an address you could use a throw-away network and proxy-arp specifically for the gateway you really want to).<br />2) If you can&#39;t do an explicit proxy-arp limited to the gateway address (since I don&#39;t like ARPing for all addresses) perhaps trying to add a minimal subnet size to the interface for the gateway IP to live there just for ARP purposes. Some equipment can even do a /32 subnet on an ethernet interface so you could only have the specific gateway as a connected route with no other addresses. Other equipment may require a /31 or /30 on the interface for the gateway address. It is good to limit the gateway address subnet size as much as possible because it will become a connected route and the connected route will always be preferred on that local device. This means you lose the ability to ping the gateway address at the opposite datacenter but you really care about the hosts anyway, right? The static route should still route for the hosts the way you want so you can ping to the hosts.<br /><br />What do you think? Definitely needs more real world testing on various gear as I suspect not all vendors handle these things the same. It&#39;s also a clunky solution and requires documentation for the poor guy who comes after you trying to understand the config. You know what they say though, &quot;Never point out a solution without providing at least one problem&quot;....or maybe that quote goes the other way around...  ;)",
