          "html": "I&#39;m testing the VRF fiesta solution in lab with Phase 3 DMVPN and having issues to get the NHRP shortcuts/redirects working. The problem is the NHRP routes for spoke to spoke tunnels are only on the DMVPN VRFs, not in the LAN VRF. This is because they are not in BGP table, so they cannot be imported/exported between VRFs.<br /><br />I could think of other ways to get it working, but I like the LAN VRF idea the most so far. Any hints how to solve this?",

Actually, if I would do the design a few years ago, I would probably end up with something similarly elegant (because it is an elegant solution).<br /><br />However, I wouldn&#39;t want to see what happens when a junior CCNP-level engineer has to troubleshoot this beast during the graveyard shift.",
