  html: IMO the &quot;questionary&quot; is valid only for transit services:<br />customer
    L2/L3 services should be took into account!

  html: You should add a question &quot;Do I want to use IPv4 building blocks to carry
    IPv6 packets and doom myself to not switch off IPv4 in my network forever?&quot;<br
    /><br />Cheers, Jan

  html: One question I have is, why is BGP neccessary on all Core routers to run native
    IPv6? I would think it is best to not have BGP running on all core routers, only
    on PE and RR.

  html: I did not understand the reasons for having to run 6PE if you have TE/FRR.<br
    /><br />I found your old post http://blog.ioshints.info/2010/03/is-ismpls-tenative-ipv6fail.html
    that says that auto route will not work but would &quot;traffic-eng forwarding-adjacency&quot;
    be an option?<br /><br />Also if you do not require TE but need FRR could you
    use LDP with Loop-Free Alternates or is there also an issue with IPv6 and Loop-Free
    Alternates?

  html: IPv6 and MPLS don&#39;t mix well (yet). There is no LDP for IPv6, so you can&#39;t
    map an IPv6 FEC to MPLS LSP. Also, because MPLS TE relies exclusively on IPv4,
    it cannot modify the IPv6 forwarding table. Actually, IS-IS tries to do just that
    and fails miserably.<br /><br />You can run IPv4 over MPLS/TE/FRR, and native
    IPv6 in parallel, which means that IPv6 won&#39;t enjoy the protection offered
    by MPLS FRR. If that&#39;s OK, go ahead. If you want very FRR-based  convergence
    for IPv6, use 6PE.<br /><br />LFA for IPv6 is definitely possible, but not implemented
    (AFAIK).

  html: Did you purposely omitted the suboptimal exit point selection problem associated
    with 6PE and OOB route-reflection? :) For an ISP, this could be a serious problem
    as IPv6 connectivity grows.

  html: How would 6PE behave worse than native IPv6 connectivity in this particular
    perspective? It is true that 6PE uses IPv4 topology to forward traffic, but assuming
    IPv4 and IPv6 topologies are congruent, 6PE-based forwarding should follow the
    same path as native IPv6 forwarding ... or am I missing something fundamental?
    Wouldn&#39;t be the first time ...<br /><br />OOB route reflectors are obviously
    a different story, and I&#39;m well aware of your opinion on that matter  8-)

  html: well, so the assumption is that 6PE will most likely use centralized (OOB)
    RRs as it&#39;s &quot;common sense&quot; in MPLS environments (oh the joys of
    BGP-free core). I haven&#39;t seen much people re-using in-band reflectors they
    have for IPv4 for their vpnv4/ipv6 reflection :) Of course, it&#39;s fine as long
    as IPv6 is not densely deployed/used, but one day a solution similar to ORR might
    be needed. Though hard to tell the inflection point where suboptimal routing for
    IPv6 might start causing real problems.

  html: It is best to not run BGP when you don&#39;t have to and hence one of the
    benefits of using IP/MPLS. However, as previously mentioned, there are no label
    distribution protocols for IPv6. Therefore it&#39;s necessary to run either BGP
    on IPv6 across your whole core or you could redistribute into your IGP (an extremely
    terrible idea  &gt;:o ).

  html: To clarify the first statement, to not run it across your core when you don&#39;t
    have to. Apologies for the inexplicable triple post as well.
