  html: regarding your hint, using ARIN (Number Resource Policy Manual)<br />as an
    example:<br />More than 1 but less than or equal to 12 sites justified, receives
    a /44 assignment; <br />More than 12 but less than or equal to 192 sites justified,
    receives a /40 assignment; <br />More than 192 but less than or equal to 3,072
    sites justified, receives a /36 assignment; <br />More than 3,072 but less than
    or equal to 49,152 sites justified, receives a /32 assignment; etc...<br />( Documentation
    in detail at https://www.arin.net/policy/nrpm.html )<br />Its great to &quot;ask
    for&quot; a /32, but you will more than likely be unable to obtain it without
    documented evidence with regard to the number of physically distinct locations
    your company has.<br /><br />Regarding IPv6 address plans and design advice, you
    may want to sync up with some of the individuals in a consultant role at cisco,
    such as advanced services. The output from AS and central engineering reference
    architecture seems to be going along a different path than your current track.

  html: Thanks for the feedback, so nice to see they nailed it down precisely. Fixed
    the text.<br /><br />As for syncing the addressing recommendations, do you have
    something specific in mind? Links to design documents? The ones I was able to
    find don&#39;t go beyond &quot;use /64 on LAN interfaces&quot;.

  html: Thanks for the information. However, I&#39;ve heard other RIRs are less specific
    about this, giving away /36, /32 long before the above requirements are met. Companies
    also seem to be in an &#39;IP-address-panic&#39; after the IPv4 shortage, and
    want large ranges to be sure. Even though a /32 with four billion subnets seems
    absolute overkill for anyone.

  html: Due to other brokenesses, the /32 actually gets you &quot;only&quot; 64K sites.
    Even though you can address 64K subnets with a /48, anything longer than a /48
    is not globally routable, so you&#39;re forced to assign a /64 to every site with
    a public Internet exit.

  html: Will any providers take a strict stance on IPv6 prefix filtering a la Sean
    Doran/Sprint in the 1990s? (http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/nanog/1998-10/msg00281.html).
    I would think not, although Ivan&#39;s RIPE pointer seems to indicate otherwise.  Router
    memory is much bigger these days, and there&#39;s more maturity in the community
    in intelligent IP address allocation &amp; management. No SP would be serving
    the public good by blocking /48s.
