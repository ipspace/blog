      "html": "Something like MAC-based or 802.1x authentication has the nice property of blocking (or at very least, significantly alleviating) loops.<br /><br />If you have MAC-based authentication enabled, then a loop causes MAC addresses to appear, and be authenticated, on different ports. Since this process is usually mediated by a radius server, you can do two things - rate-limit it, and watch for well-known MACs like your routers, HSRP/VRRP vMACs and so forth, and &quot;detect&quot; the loop - then deny all authentication (and thus, learning) of new MACs on that switch/port combo for a period of time.<br /><br />If you have 802.1x it works even better; the phone supplicant only runs on the &quot;network&quot; facing port. The PC-facing port doesn&#39;t have an 802.1x supplicant, so the upstream switch port never goes to &quot;forwarding&quot;.<br /><br />Both have other benefits (RADIUS-based vlan assignment, proper logging of who is where, accounting, etc.)<br /><br />We have observed that loops are much less harmful to the upstream network when being &quot;gated&quot; by mac/802.1x auth. You get local weirdness, but it&#39;s rare for it to take the network out, and you can find the location of the weirdness from the radius logs, and fix the problem.",

      "html": "You have indicated some useful port security protection features, but none do not address the question posed. The question seem not to be about a device sending bpdus to the switch, which means it would be able trigger a STP topology change so it would become part of the STP. So it would require bpdu protection so that if the switch gets bpdu on those ports, it would take the configured action.",
