  html: "May be you start from here  <br />IGP-based \u201Crestoration\u201D techniques\
    \ have one important problem. During the time of re-convergence, temporary micro-loops\
    \ may exist in the topology due to inconsistency of FIB (forwarding) tables of\
    \ different routers. This behavior is fundamental to link-state algorithms, as\
    \ routers closer to failure tend to update their forwarding database before the\
    \ other routers.  <br /> <br />Postet from here:  <br />http://blog.ine.com/2010/06/02/ospf-fast-convergenc/\
    \  <br /> <br />With LFA we always have Loop free alternative and avoid micro-loops\
    \ during convergence. And you want to describe that nowtime something is changed?\
    \  <br /> <br />Or maybe LFA applicabilityin SP networks?  <br />http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtgwg-lfa-applicability-06"

  html: Good guess, and definitely another interesting topic (thank you!), but not
    even close.<br /><br />BTW, with LFA we don&#39;t always have loop-free alternative
    (Pierre Francois&#39; presentation addressed that in details).

  html: I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m way off here, but it&#39;s Friday and I&#39;m hungover,
    so I&#39;m using that as my excuse.<br /><br />Perhaps you are delving into a
    comparison of optimizations used for RIB-to-FIB convergence time for the routing
    protocols vs. what would be required in a controller-based OpenFlow environment.

  html: Ivan,<br /><br />You mentioned router not always have an LFA.<br /><br />This
    true and depend of topoogy, ring topology for exemple is a good case. <br /><br
    />Remote LFA will address this caveats. Remote LFA wil compute the PQ node and
    then establish a dLDP session with PQ node and establish a  MPLS tunnel automatically.
    <br /><br />PQ node is the first node not sending traffic back to the router.
    <br /><br />Cisco implementation will be available in march 2012.<br /><br />Bertrand

    html: It&#39;s my understanding that PIC is the backup-path-in-FIB mechanism,
      while LFA is an OSPF/IS-IS-specific solution that calculates those backup paths.

  html: So Ivan, as i can see from the both article, there is no difference between
    LFA &amp; PIC... Is it?
