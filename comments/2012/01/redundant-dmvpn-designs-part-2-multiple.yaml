    html: I&#39;m testing the VRF fiesta solution in lab with Phase 3 DMVPN and having
      issues to get the NHRP shortcuts/redirects working. The problem is the NHRP
      routes for spoke to spoke tunnels are only on the DMVPN VRFs, not in the LAN
      VRF. This is because they are not in BGP table, so they cannot be imported/exported
      between VRFs.<br /><br />I could think of other ways to get it working, but
      I like the LAN VRF idea the most so far. Any hints how to solve this?

  html: 'comment to &quot;Drawback: you need between three and five VRFs (three to
    support this design, two more for split default routing in Phase 2/3 DMVPN) on
    the spoke routers and route redistribution through BGP.&quot; <br /><br />in our
    configuration we need to redistribute about 2 000 routes for different reasons
    and this configuration also working on CISCO871 routers with IOS version adventerprisek9-mz.124-24.T
    and higher without problems. the main thing - properly configure routing.'

  html: I&#39;m not saying it wouldn&#39;t work or couldn&#39;t be done. Actually,
    if I would do the design a few years ago, I would probably end up with something
    similarly elegant (because it is an elegant solution).<br /><br />However, I wouldn&#39;t
    want to see what happens when a junior CCNP-level engineer has to troubleshoot
    this beast during the graveyard shift.

  html: Ivan, I like the quick-and-dirty, back-of-the-napkin diagrams.  Are you using
    a drawing program on the iPad to make those?  The output looks very similar to
    Penultimate which I&#39;ve also used.

    html: 'Let me rephrase your question: you have a 200+ branch network connected
      to 2 service providers and yet don&#39;t have the funding to solve your design
      problems?'
