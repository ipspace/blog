  html: Ahh, this old chestnut.  Thankfully I&#39;ve not had to touch this problem
    since, but it&#39;s good to know it -actually- works now, instead of using hack-ey
    hacks.  While the point to point link numbering doesn&#39;t strictly matter and
    it&#39;s all about the PD in realistic terms, people are just very fond of statics.

  html: How can you turn on debug on the PE to see all those ipv6 nd and ipv6 dhcp
    messages with this vrf setup?? I have not able to do the debug except on the CPE
    side. Your kindly advise.

  html: Hi,<br /><br />We would like setup into our radius /48 pool that we delegate
    into /56. Does it possible ? <br /><br />If not how can I setup such pool directly
    on the Cisco router ?
