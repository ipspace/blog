            <div class="comment-content">Hey Ivan,<br /><br />I&#39;m working on a large scheme like this now.<br /><br />Moving the subnet without re-numbering as you suggest seems natural, but makes DR *testing* really complicated, so my customer is on the &quot;change IP numbers&quot; track.<br /><br />Here are some complications that DNS can&#39;t solve:<br />- multiple security zones in the data center? DNS doesn&#39;t help the firewalls much.<br />- reconfiguring the VM&#39;s IP is easy (VMware SRM does this), but reconfiguring application listen directives (think apache config file) is not easy. lots of custom per-application scripting work is required.<br /><br />Vendors like to claim their offerings are turn-key DR. Customers who believe it will be disappointed :-)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />In terms of the listed solutions:<br />1. DNS - customers complain about the reaction time. On the other hand disaster recovery does not require fast detection and a DNS refresh.<br />2. Hosts routes - harder to manage. LISP will be a good choice but it is emerging technology and more time is required.<br />3. Routing protocols on servers not an option at this moment but in the virtualized DC it is feasible. We can have not only firewalls, load-balancers, switches but also routing protocols running on the hipervisor.<br />4. Load-Balancers seem to be the best option listed. The global director or simply a router with a conditional route advertisement can do a prefix insertion.<br />5. NAT harder to manage and consumes resources unless the stateless translation is used. NAT is better to avoid not because it will not work but to leave it as the last resort solution in the case of problems to IPv6 migration.<br /><br />Another options:<br />6. Proxy ARP + L3 Edge. There are some security drawbacks especially if a firewall is in between but it is considerable.<br />7. Fabric-Path/TRILL for IP. In this option DC is fully L3 routed. There is no such standards nowadays but we could create it. ;)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan, this issue with a hard-coded IP it is not a big deal in a disaster recovery data center. A bigger issue is with an active/active scenario. Even with load-balancers there will be problems with asymmetric routing which increases latency (it is very undesirable in mobile networks) and it is hard to manage on a firewall.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">#1 (DNS): use low TTL. The &quot;only&quot; problem is that the web visitors might have to restart the browser session (even though DNS pinning is not as aggressive these days at is used to be).<br /><br />#2 - if you want to retain IP addresses without stretching L2 subnets, host routes (or LISP) are unfortunately the only way to go.<br /><br />#3 - We had routing protocols on servers 30 years ago. Come on ;)<br /><br />#6 - I used to believe in Proxy ARP. No longer. Anyhow, it solves only server-to-GW problem, nothing more.<br /><br />#7 - Don&#39;t even try to go there. Either you solve the problem on L3, and then you&#39;re back to LISP or host routes, or on L2, where you could easily use VXLAN (but we don&#39;t want split subnets anyway).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">1. DNS can be an option for active/standby DCs but it is not perceived as a fast solution for active/active DCs.  <br /><br />2. The only way to go? What about load-balancers? With a disaster recovery DC it is also an option. The secondary LB + edge router start advertising VIP prefixes after a switchover button is pushed. <br /><br />3. It is not an option not because there is no routing on servers but because IPs of GWs are fixed.  <br /><br />6. The funny thing Proxy ARP is shown by the Cisco BU as a part of the LISP solution in the case of IP address movement. That&#39;s right that Proxy ARP solves only to-GW problem but from this point there is pure L3 network with the conditional advertisements/IP SLA/PfR and so on.<br /><br />7. By saying &#39;Fabric-Path/TRILL for IP&#39; I did not mean the existing feature. I will rephrase it in an another way. Imagine that a network of switches compose a topology based on Switch-IDs. This network behaves like L3 not STP. After connecting a host/server with IP this address will be advertised to other participants which require a connectivity. In such a way we could achieve a full mobility of IPs which will have /128 address. Hosts do not need to use GWs as all links could be point-to-point to the nearest SW.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">2. Static routes are not necessary. A disaster recovery DC can have the same addressing scheme as the primary one so rather connected/dynamic routes. Using LBs in the active/standby scenario is easier comparing to the active/active.<br /><br />3. In this scenario it is fine if only loopbacks were used.<br /><br />7. There is a major difference between such a future feature and existing IS-IS. The IS-IS topology is Switch-ID based not IP. It means that a switch in-between does not need to know IPs. All IPs could be divided using additional segment ID to allow virtualization. It doesn&#39;t have to be IS-IS. It can be BGP or another protocol which will create a cloud for connected IPs. Another version would be fully routed DC environment and LISP VM Mobility.</div>

The nearest edge device could serve as a gateway. Other steps will be similar to FabPath. But c&#39;mon, don&#39;t require the full description from me today. I&#39;ve just started thinking it up. ;)<br /><br />I am now considering another issue with a default route in such a solution. Whether to use the same mechanism as it is in 6rd or something else.

            <div class="comment-content">I honestly think load balancers are the best approach currently. F5 showed a nice functional example during Tech Field Day 3, and it&#39;s the only moderately-convincing solution I&#39;ve seen yet. But it&#39;s not optimal, with a massive trombone sometimes added and added latency of the device itself.<br /><br />As for DNS, I&#39;m really concerned about all the &quot;optimization&quot; that various clients and NAT devices do interfering with a short TTL. And how short practically can the TTL be, anyway? You don&#39;t want clients hitting your DNS server for every request, after all. And DNS solutions will still break sessions in progress.<br /><br />What about some kind of long-distance distributed VXLAN? Have a virtualization-aware gateway in the network that maintains tunnels to the proper location. I guess I just invented a load balancer!  :-D<br /><br />Finally, where can I learn more about LISP? I keep hearing about it but know very little at this point.<br /><br />Thanks, Ivan!</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Running routing protocols on the servers is a fantastic solution; I don&#39;t understand why it isn&#39;t done more often.<br /><br />  1) the IP moves elegantly with the service<br />  2) if your application is well written you can now go active active (anycasting)<br />  3) DR testing is also a breeze -- bring up the test scenario on your live network but with the test node&#39;s route &quot;slugged&quot; (huge metric) so the local test systems see the DR test environment but nobody else sees it.<br /><br />And if you&#39;re deeply afraid of server guys doing bad things to your routing table, you can always put all the servers into an unrouted vlan and put a &quot;router&quot; VM such as one from vyatta or something similar in front of that vlan and have that do the route advertisements.<br /><br />I say it&#39;s time for datacenter servers to stop having static routes.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">LISP seems like a good solution for VM mobility, very much like LAM in concept for the DC but obviously a more complicated protocol involving dynamic tunnelling. However the tunneling aspect surely means that added functionality is needed in the DC firewalls between security zones as they cannot yet inspect this traffic before it gets to the ETR which is directly conencted to the subnet that the VM is on.<br /><br />I&#39;m struggling with this part because I believe LISP would solve a big problem, but we would need the firewall to have LISP intelligence to see inside the LISP packet. Maybe this is coming too.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">What do you think about trying to use static routes pointing out of the interface without a next-hop? A static route configured without a next-hop pointing out of an ethernet interface will still cause the device to ARP for hosts. It gives the benefit over a connected route in that you can still control administrative distance of the static route. You can add your host subnet this way with a higher Administrative Distance then redistribute the static route into BGP. You can then strip the weight and set the Local Preference and do all sorts of fun things to it in BGP so even a received BGP route for the same subnet will be preferred over the route on the local device but you can advertise it as a backup. This would allow you to prefer your primary datacenter over the backup even from backup datacenter&#39;s router / firewall itself... so long as you have a better route received from BGP from the primary datacenter.<br /><br />This works for the host subnet route but for the gateway address for that subnet, depending on the hardware, you may be able to:<br />1) Use proxy-arp for the specific gateway address only, if this is supported. Some gear will let you specify the host addresses themselves you want to proxy arp for. If you have equipment that can do this it is nice (some equipment will not even require an IP on the interface to do this, if it does require an address you could use a throw-away network and proxy-arp specifically for the gateway you really want to).<br />2) If you can&#39;t do an explicit proxy-arp limited to the gateway address (since I don&#39;t like ARPing for all addresses) perhaps trying to add a minimal subnet size to the interface for the gateway IP to live there just for ARP purposes. Some equipment can even do a /32 subnet on an ethernet interface so you could only have the specific gateway as a connected route with no other addresses. Other equipment may require a /31 or /30 on the interface for the gateway address. It is good to limit the gateway address subnet size as much as possible because it will become a connected route and the connected route will always be preferred on that local device. This means you lose the ability to ping the gateway address at the opposite datacenter but you really care about the hosts anyway, right? The static route should still route for the hosts the way you want so you can ping to the hosts.<br /><br />What do you think? Definitely needs more real world testing on various gear as I suspect not all vendors handle these things the same. It&#39;s also a clunky solution and requires documentation for the poor guy who comes after you trying to understand the config. You know what they say though, &quot;Never point out a solution without providing at least one problem&quot;....or maybe that quote goes the other way around...  ;)</div>
