The output from AS and central engineering reference architecture seems to be going along a different path than your current track.",

Companies also seem to be in an &#39;IP-address-panic&#39; after the IPv4 shortage, and want large ranges to be sure. Even though a /32 with four billion subnets seems absolute overkill for anyone.",

I would think not, although Ivan&#39;s RIPE pointer seems to indicate otherwise.  Router memory is much bigger these days, and there&#39;s more maturity in the community in intelligent IP address allocation &amp; management. No SP would be serving the public good by blocking /48s.",
