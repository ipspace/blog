  html: Exact ianh, had the same issue and applied port-security in order to limit
    the number of hosts per port with storm-control. Not perfect !!!

  html: We have seen this a few times so far. Catalyst 3560 access layer switches,
    Cisco IP Phones. <br />Switchports are configured with a voice vlan, Portfast
    is enabled with BPDU guard. <br />It seems the phone bridges the data and the
    voice vlan.<br />The switches so far were not able to catch it. <br />Brings down
    pretty much everything including the distribution layer switches, pretty nasty.

  html: Something like MAC-based or 802.1x authentication has the nice property of
    blocking (or at very least, significantly alleviating) loops.<br /><br />If you
    have MAC-based authentication enabled, then a loop causes MAC addresses to appear,
    and be authenticated, on different ports. Since this process is usually mediated
    by a radius server, you can do two things - rate-limit it, and watch for well-known
    MACs like your routers, HSRP/VRRP vMACs and so forth, and &quot;detect&quot; the
    loop - then deny all authentication (and thus, learning) of new MACs on that switch/port
    combo for a period of time.<br /><br />If you have 802.1x it works even better;
    the phone supplicant only runs on the &quot;network&quot; facing port. The PC-facing
    port doesn&#39;t have an 802.1x supplicant, so the upstream switch port never
    goes to &quot;forwarding&quot;.<br /><br />Both have other benefits (RADIUS-based
    vlan assignment, proper logging of who is where, accounting, etc.)<br /><br />We
    have observed that loops are much less harmful to the upstream network when being
    &quot;gated&quot; by mac/802.1x auth. You get local weirdness, but it&#39;s rare
    for it to take the network out, and you can find the location of the weirdness
    from the radius logs, and fix the problem.

  html: The loop would cause &gt;$maximum MACs to be learnt on a port - thus, the
    port-security &quot;violation&quot; action kicks in, and breaks the loop.

  html: "I just found the following in my outbox, from a conversation about SOHO boxes\
    \ along these same lines. A relevant Seifert quote is here too.<br />-----------------<br\
    \ /><br />Bridges usually fall into one of two categories:  Those that support\
    \ 802.1D, and those that don\u2019t.<br /><br />Those that support 802.1D do all\
    \ of the right things STP-wise, so no problem.<br /><br />Those that don&#39;t\
    \ support 802.1D don&#39;t generate or understand BPDUs, but they also don&#39;t\
    \ know about the 802.1D requirement to filter frames in the range 01:80:C2:00:00:00-01:80:C2:00:00:0F.\
    \  This means that they&#39;ll pass BPDUs generated by the rest of the network.\
    \  The SOHO box won&#39;t prevent loops on its own, but the rest of the network\
    \ should detect and correct the problem*<br /><br />In &#39;The All-New Switch\
    \ Book&#39;, Rich Seifert said: &quot;if you&#39;re going to violate 802.1D, you\
    \ have to violate it *all*the*way*&quot;"

  html: '&quot;Today a user plugged in both of these ports into the switch.&quot;<br
    /><br />I think it is more a policy issue than a feature issue.  Why would you
    let your user connect network devices to the switch directly?  Shouldn&#39;t the
    switch be secure somewhere?'

  html: Brocade FastIron series supports &quot;loop detect&quot; on a port or a VLAN.
    It sends out probes and watches for those probes to come back. (yes, it sounds
    like bpdus, but they&#39;re not). Depending on how the loop detect is configured,
    it can err disable the port. This feature was created for just this scenario,
    where people don&#39;t want to (or can&#39;t) use spanning-tree.

  html: HP procurve have the same feature. Extreme have it too - though they call
    it ELRP. I believe both of them work by sending a packet to a multicast MAC periodically
    and then listening to see if it comes back.

  html: Hey all,<br /><br />I was the person who originally asked the question(thanks
    for posting Ivan).<br /><br />Some background, this happened during an office
    move, when movers showed initiative and plugged in everything that fits into the
    jack. Explaining that movers brought down corp network leaves you feeling pretty
    stupid. <br /><br />Thank you all for your suggestions, I think limiting the number
    of MACs per port and 802.1x look promising. Though 802.1x on IP phones is a pain
    in the butt.

  html: I agree - as long as you have syslog/SNMP monitoring and you monitor it. <br
    /><br />However, it&#39;s important not to use port security auto recovery on
    it, otherwise the loop will break and restart a while later.<br /><br />Restrict
    will be more permissive, but may make the issue harder to pinpoint/detect. I&#39;d
    use shutdown, as it will surely make something break.

  html: Some simple ways to limit damage is by making sure port configuration has
    the following:<br /><br />* storm control set to the lowest bandwidth needed to
    get the job done.<br />* explicit maximum allowed number of source MACs that can
    be learned over the port (port security feature).  This limits looping packets
    to the configured maximum of source macs.  Set it to the lowest number needed
    to get the job done.<br />* unused ports should always be disabled and also have
    the above two settings &quot;just in case&quot;.<br /><br />Ideally the IEEE would
    have standardized a UNI to exchange source MACs a long time ago so such bandaids
    wouldn&#39;t be necessary and so many unnecessary outages avoided.

  html: It sounds like a very simple solution. If the port is not supposed to be receiving
    BPDUS, then configure the switch to use root protection on those ports. Set bpdu-block-on-edge
    with a timeout value if you are suing Juniper switches, I should say.

  html: You have indicated some useful port security protection features, but none
    do not address the question posed. The question seem not to be about a device
    sending bpdus to the switch, which means it would be able trigger a STP topology
    change so it would become part of the STP. So it would require bpdu protection
    so that if the switch gets bpdu on those ports, it would take the configured action.
