Ivan&#39;s book on EIGRP was critical to my design and migration approach. EIGRP is very fast on convergence and when I was reading about MPLS Fast Reroute it reminded of EIGRP&#39;s feasible successor ability but manually created. Also there is adjusting timers for EIGRP, debounce timers, carrier delays NSF and BFD. OSPF has these options too. Now throw MPLS into it, LSPs need a L3 routing protocol to connect and you have more &quot;junk&quot; on top of your topology to influence convergence. I even for one client used the variance unequal cost load balancing feature to solve a problem. I haven&#39;t done much with it lately and not sure of its status. I liked  EIGRP and if they update it can still be very very powerful.<br /><br />sheeshe it is 2012 where is that one protocol for all. <br /><br />Okay where is the post for IPX/SPX where you can have a 10k node network and none of the subnetting issues etc and now since we can all have 1 to 10gig links who cares if it is a heavy protocol.  ;)",

The EIGRP feasibility condition is a strict one, and the cost for B-X via C must be less than A-X via C for the condition to be met.<br /><br />In practice when testing I see much quicker failover than OSPF dead time expiry. I reckon the link failure is detected in hardware, RIB, FIB entries are removed and this potentially forces OSPF to recalculate a path?",
