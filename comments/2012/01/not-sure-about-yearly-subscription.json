Looking at the rate old technologies get obsoleted and newer ones gets reinvented, the experience part will not playso much as a competitive advantage... just like a jedi and the jedi master, their skills should be on par... and if you are a sith, you probably should finished off the master in no time...",

Nothing really new has been invented in the last 10+ years (even OpenFlow is a resurrection of MLS Cisco had in Catalyst 5000). <br /><br />Assuming you always focus on the concepts, not implementation recipes, you&#39;ll be able to master new technologies significantly quicker if you&#39;ve seen X technologies in the past.<br /><br />My favorite example: ADSL is a combination of baseband modems, modem racks (called DSLAMs), ATM switches (in DSLAMs), bridging-over-ATM, PPP and IP-over-PPP. Not a single new technology there.",

I am only a near CCNP yet I find these webinars full of information that is just right for someone stepping into the topic.<br /><br />They help tackle a giant subject and break it down into small pieces that are easier to digest. I cannot speak more highly of Ivan&#39;s technical knowledge and prowess behind the CLI.<br />A subject matter expert on a myriad of subjects.",
