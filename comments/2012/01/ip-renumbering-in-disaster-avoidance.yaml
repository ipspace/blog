  html: Hey Ivan,<br /><br />I&#39;m working on a large scheme like this now.<br /><br
    />Moving the subnet without re-numbering as you suggest seems natural, but makes
    DR *testing* really complicated, so my customer is on the &quot;change IP numbers&quot;
    track.<br /><br />Here are some complications that DNS can&#39;t solve:<br />-
    multiple security zones in the data center? DNS doesn&#39;t help the firewalls
    much.<br />- reconfiguring the VM&#39;s IP is easy (VMware SRM does this), but
    reconfiguring application listen directives (think apache config file) is not
    easy. lots of custom per-application scripting work is required.<br /><br />Vendors
    like to claim their offerings are turn-key DR. Customers who believe it will be
    disappointed :-)

  html: Simply had to check Apache documentation:<br /><br />* Virtual hosts can use
    DNS FQDN<br />* Listen directives seem to use only IP addresses, not interface
    names or DNS FQDN.<br /><br />No comment :( ... and I thought Apache web server
    was a shining example of good programming.

  html: Don&#39;t blame Apache for utilizing the OS socket library and having the
    same limitations. Besides, if you bind to * and run one IP per VM it should be
    a non-issue.

  html: '&quot;zoning&quot; is the key term to firewalling there, you simply don&#39;t
    create any per host rules. You can have firewalls that are aware of networks on
    your other sites. State table handling is different box of worms.'

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />In terms of the listed solutions:<br />1. DNS - customers
    complain about the reaction time. On the other hand disaster recovery does not
    require fast detection and a DNS refresh.<br />2. Hosts routes - harder to manage.
    LISP will be a good choice but it is emerging technology and more time is required.<br
    />3. Routing protocols on servers not an option at this moment but in the virtualized
    DC it is feasible. We can have not only firewalls, load-balancers, switches but
    also routing protocols running on the hipervisor.<br />4. Load-Balancers seem
    to be the best option listed. The global director or simply a router with a conditional
    route advertisement can do a prefix insertion.<br />5. NAT harder to manage and
    consumes resources unless the stateless translation is used. NAT is better to
    avoid not because it will not work but to leave it as the last resort solution
    in the case of problems to IPv6 migration.<br /><br />Another options:<br />6.
    Proxy ARP + L3 Edge. There are some security drawbacks especially if a firewall
    is in between but it is considerable.<br />7. Fabric-Path/TRILL for IP. In this
    option DC is fully L3 routed. There is no such standards nowadays but we could
    create it. ;)

  html: Ivan, this issue with a hard-coded IP it is not a big deal in a disaster recovery
    data center. A bigger issue is with an active/active scenario. Even with load-balancers
    there will be problems with asymmetric routing which increases latency (it is
    very undesirable in mobile networks) and it is hard to manage on a firewall.

  html: 1. DNS can be an option for active/standby DCs but it is not perceived as
    a fast solution for active/active DCs.  <br /><br />2. The only way to go? What
    about load-balancers? With a disaster recovery DC it is also an option. The secondary
    LB + edge router start advertising VIP prefixes after a switchover button is pushed.
    <br /><br />3. It is not an option not because there is no routing on servers
    but because IPs of GWs are fixed.  <br /><br />6. The funny thing Proxy ARP is
    shown by the Cisco BU as a part of the LISP solution in the case of IP address
    movement. That&#39;s right that Proxy ARP solves only to-GW problem but from this
    point there is pure L3 network with the conditional advertisements/IP SLA/PfR
    and so on.<br /><br />7. By saying &#39;Fabric-Path/TRILL for IP&#39; I did not
    mean the existing feature. I will rephrase it in an another way. Imagine that
    a network of switches compose a topology based on Switch-IDs. This network behaves
    like L3 not STP. After connecting a host/server with IP this address will be advertised
    to other participants which require a connectivity. In such a way we could achieve
    a full mobility of IPs which will have /128 address. Hosts do not need to use
    GWs as all links could be point-to-point to the nearest SW.

  html: 2. Static routes are not necessary. A disaster recovery DC can have the same
    addressing scheme as the primary one so rather connected/dynamic routes. Using
    LBs in the active/standby scenario is easier comparing to the active/active.<br
    /><br />3. In this scenario it is fine if only loopbacks were used.<br /><br />7.
    There is a major difference between such a future feature and existing IS-IS.
    The IS-IS topology is Switch-ID based not IP. It means that a switch in-between
    does not need to know IPs. All IPs could be divided using additional segment ID
    to allow virtualization. It doesn&#39;t have to be IS-IS. It can be BGP or another
    protocol which will create a cloud for connected IPs. Another version would be
    fully routed DC environment and LISP VM Mobility.

  html: 7. Upon the connectivity of an IP device to a cloud a register message would
    be required. Then you don&#39;t need ARP over the cloud. The nearest edge device
    could serve as a gateway. Other steps will be similar to FabPath. But c&#39;mon,
    don&#39;t require the full description from me today. I&#39;ve just started thinking
    it up. ;)<br /><br />I am now considering another issue with a default route in
    such a solution. Whether to use the same mechanism as it is in 6rd or something
    else. I will get back to you within couple of months.

  html: I honestly think load balancers are the best approach currently. F5 showed
    a nice functional example during Tech Field Day 3, and it&#39;s the only moderately-convincing
    solution I&#39;ve seen yet. But it&#39;s not optimal, with a massive trombone
    sometimes added and added latency of the device itself.<br /><br />As for DNS,
    I&#39;m really concerned about all the &quot;optimization&quot; that various clients
    and NAT devices do interfering with a short TTL. And how short practically can
    the TTL be, anyway? You don&#39;t want clients hitting your DNS server for every
    request, after all. And DNS solutions will still break sessions in progress.<br
    /><br />What about some kind of long-distance distributed VXLAN? Have a virtualization-aware
    gateway in the network that maintains tunnels to the proper location. I guess
    I just invented a load balancer!  :-D<br /><br />Finally, where can I learn more
    about LISP? I keep hearing about it but know very little at this point.<br /><br
    />Thanks, Ivan!

  html: Running routing protocols on the servers is a fantastic solution; I don&#39;t
    understand why it isn&#39;t done more often.<br /><br />  1) the IP moves elegantly
    with the service<br />  2) if your application is well written you can now go
    active active (anycasting)<br />  3) DR testing is also a breeze -- bring up the
    test scenario on your live network but with the test node&#39;s route &quot;slugged&quot;
    (huge metric) so the local test systems see the DR test environment but nobody
    else sees it.<br /><br />And if you&#39;re deeply afraid of server guys doing
    bad things to your routing table, you can always put all the servers into an unrouted
    vlan and put a &quot;router&quot; VM such as one from vyatta or something similar
    in front of that vlan and have that do the route advertisements.<br /><br />I
    say it&#39;s time for datacenter servers to stop having static routes.

    html: LISP is great for cold VM mobility, you still need L2 connectivity for hot
      VM mobility. <br /><br />LISP can help you get optimal inbound traffic after
      VM move, but the stretched L2 subnet is stil required. Watch NFD3 presentation
      from Victor Moreno.

  html: LISP seems like a good solution for VM mobility, very much like LAM in concept
    for the DC but obviously a more complicated protocol involving dynamic tunnelling.
    However the tunneling aspect surely means that added functionality is needed in
    the DC firewalls between security zones as they cannot yet inspect this traffic
    before it gets to the ETR which is directly conencted to the subnet that the VM
    is on.<br /><br />I&#39;m struggling with this part because I believe LISP would
    solve a big problem, but we would need the firewall to have LISP intelligence
    to see inside the LISP packet. Maybe this is coming too.

  html: What do you think about trying to use static routes pointing out of the interface
    without a next-hop? A static route configured without a next-hop pointing out
    of an ethernet interface will still cause the device to ARP for hosts. It gives
    the benefit over a connected route in that you can still control administrative
    distance of the static route. You can add your host subnet this way with a higher
    Administrative Distance then redistribute the static route into BGP. You can then
    strip the weight and set the Local Preference and do all sorts of fun things to
    it in BGP so even a received BGP route for the same subnet will be preferred over
    the route on the local device but you can advertise it as a backup. This would
    allow you to prefer your primary datacenter over the backup even from backup datacenter&#39;s
    router / firewall itself... so long as you have a better route received from BGP
    from the primary datacenter.<br /><br />This works for the host subnet route but
    for the gateway address for that subnet, depending on the hardware, you may be
    able to:<br />1) Use proxy-arp for the specific gateway address only, if this
    is supported. Some gear will let you specify the host addresses themselves you
    want to proxy arp for. If you have equipment that can do this it is nice (some
    equipment will not even require an IP on the interface to do this, if it does
    require an address you could use a throw-away network and proxy-arp specifically
    for the gateway you really want to).<br />2) If you can&#39;t do an explicit proxy-arp
    limited to the gateway address (since I don&#39;t like ARPing for all addresses)
    perhaps trying to add a minimal subnet size to the interface for the gateway IP
    to live there just for ARP purposes. Some equipment can even do a /32 subnet on
    an ethernet interface so you could only have the specific gateway as a connected
    route with no other addresses. Other equipment may require a /31 or /30 on the
    interface for the gateway address. It is good to limit the gateway address subnet
    size as much as possible because it will become a connected route and the connected
    route will always be preferred on that local device. This means you lose the ability
    to ping the gateway address at the opposite datacenter but you really care about
    the hosts anyway, right? The static route should still route for the hosts the
    way you want so you can ping to the hosts.<br /><br />What do you think? Definitely
    needs more real world testing on various gear as I suspect not all vendors handle
    these things the same. It&#39;s also a clunky solution and requires documentation
    for the poor guy who comes after you trying to understand the config. You know
