  html: Hello Ivan,<br /><br />It is common inside any ISP core network to use at
    least one RR?<br /><br />Can you share with us, why is that?

  html: Scaling IBGP. Without a RR, you need a full mesh of IBGP sessions (between
    every pair of BGP-speaking routers).

  html: 'Without RR you would need #PE x (#PE - 1) / z iBGP sessions<br />With two
    RR (for redundancy) you would need 2 x #PE +1 iBGP sessions<br /><br />#PE being
    the number of PE in your network... So if you have 6 or more PE, RR decrease the
    number of iBGP sessions required...'
