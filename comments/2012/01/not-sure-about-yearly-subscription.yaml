  html: Heh, I though the same :)<br /><br />Maybe he was referring to &#39;DC/VM/NXOS&#39;
    only.

  html: Hm... Is there a big difference between a young and old CCIE? Looking at the
    rate old technologies get obsoleted and newer ones gets reinvented, the experience
    part will not playso much as a competitive advantage... just like a jedi and the
    jedi master, their skills should be on par... and if you are a sith, you probably
    should finished off the master in no time...

  html: 'If we measure &quot;young and old&quot; in terms of experience, not physical
    age, then there&#39;s a huge difference. Nothing really new has been invented
    in the last 10+ years (even OpenFlow is a resurrection of MLS Cisco had in Catalyst
    5000). <br /><br />Assuming you always focus on the concepts, not implementation
    recipes, you&#39;ll be able to master new technologies significantly quicker if
    you&#39;ve seen X technologies in the past.<br /><br />My favorite example: ADSL
    is a combination of baseband modems, modem racks (called DSLAMs), ATM switches
    (in DSLAMs), bridging-over-ATM, PPP and IP-over-PPP. Not a single new technology
    there.'

  html: Tell your Twitter friend &quot;Hell, yes!&quot; from me  ;) Seriously, I don&#39;t
    have CCIE, live as small specialized cog in world of large SP machinery and I
    find those webinars very useful to keep up with current trends, gain overview
    of technologies and know where to start.

  html: Without hesitation I would pay the money again and again. My friend Kurt Bales
    (@networkjanitor) got me onto these webinars. I am only a near CCNP yet I find
    these webinars full of information that is just right for someone stepping into
    the topic.<br /><br />They help tackle a giant subject and break it down into
    small pieces that are easier to digest. I cannot speak more highly of Ivan&#39;s
    technical knowledge and prowess behind the CLI.<br />A subject matter expert on
    a myriad of subjects.
