      "html": "May be you start from here  <br />IGP-based \u201crestoration\u201d techniques have one important problem. During the time of re-convergence, temporary micro-loops may exist in the topology due to inconsistency of FIB (forwarding) tables of different routers. This behavior is fundamental to link-state algorithms, as routers closer to failure tend to update their forwarding database before the other routers.  <br /> <br />Postet from here:  <br />http://blog.ine.com/2010/06/02/ospf-fast-convergenc/  <br /> <br />With LFA we always have Loop free alternative and avoid micro-loops during convergence. And you want to describe that nowtime something is changed?  <br /> <br />Or maybe LFA applicabilityin SP networks?  <br />http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtgwg-lfa-applicability-06",

Remote LFA wil compute the PQ node and then establish a dLDP session with PQ node and establish a  MPLS tunnel automatically. <br /><br />PQ node is the first node not sending traffic back to the router. <br /><br />Cisco implementation will be available in march 2012.<br /><br />Bertrand (PM LFA, ISIS &amp; BGP)",
