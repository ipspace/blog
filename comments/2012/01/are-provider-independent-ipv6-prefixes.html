            <div class="comment-content">regarding your hint, using ARIN (Number Resource Policy Manual)<br />as an example:<br />More than 1 but less than or equal to 12 sites justified, receives a /44 assignment; <br />More than 12 but less than or equal to 192 sites justified, receives a /40 assignment; <br />More than 192 but less than or equal to 3,072 sites justified, receives a /36 assignment; <br />More than 3,072 but less than or equal to 49,152 sites justified, receives a /32 assignment; etc...<br />( Documentation in detail at https://www.arin.net/policy/nrpm.html )<br />Its great to &quot;ask for&quot; a /32, but you will more than likely be unable to obtain it without documented evidence with regard to the number of physically distinct locations your company has.<br /><br />Regarding IPv6 address plans and design advice, you may want to sync up with some of the individuals in a consultant role at cisco, such as advanced services. The output from AS and central engineering reference architecture seems to be going along a different path than your current track.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Thanks for the information. However, I&#39;ve heard other RIRs are less specific about this, giving away /36, /32 long before the above requirements are met. Companies also seem to be in an &#39;IP-address-panic&#39; after the IPv4 shortage, and want large ranges to be sure. Even though a /32 with four billion subnets seems absolute overkill for anyone.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Due to other brokenesses, the /32 actually gets you &quot;only&quot; 64K sites. Even though you can address 64K subnets with a /48, anything longer than a /48 is not globally routable, so you&#39;re forced to assign a /64 to every site with a public Internet exit.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Will any providers take a strict stance on IPv6 prefix filtering a la Sean Doran/Sprint in the 1990s? (http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/nanog/1998-10/msg00281.html). I would think not, although Ivan&#39;s RIPE pointer seems to indicate otherwise.  Router memory is much bigger these days, and there&#39;s more maturity in the community in intelligent IP address allocation &amp; management. No SP would be serving the public good by blocking /48s.</div>
