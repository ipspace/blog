Also, because MPLS TE relies exclusively on IPv4, it cannot modify the IPv6 forwarding table. Actually, IS-IS tries to do just that and fails miserably.<br /><br />You can run IPv4 over MPLS/TE/FRR, and native IPv6 in parallel, which means that IPv6 won&#39;t enjoy the protection offered by MPLS FRR. If that&#39;s OK, go ahead. If you want very FRR-based  convergence for IPv6, use 6PE.<br /><br />LFA for IPv6 is definitely possible, but not implemented (AFAIK).",

I haven&#39;t seen much people re-using in-band reflectors they have for IPv4 for their vpnv4/ipv6 reflection :) Of course, it&#39;s fine as long as IPv6 is not densely deployed/used, but one day a solution similar to ORR might be needed.
