Just one thing I want to clarify regarding the above scenario, My spokes need local Internet access ( normal NAT overload). In your videos you recommend to use different VRFs for ISP uplinks and not to use PBR.  <br /><br />So my question is, can I use VRFs and still allow internal users to access internet without going through the hub? <br />What would be my best option here..??<br />Thanks a lot for taking time for this. :)",

      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I&#39;ve been trying to find a solution for this scenario for last three months.<br /><br />I have 3 routers each one has ADSL and 3G interfaces. one of them will be a hub and the other two will be spokes. What is the best way to have redundancy for this topology?. I am thinking of configuring 2 DMVPN clouds, one on the DSL and other on the 3G. I know that, if I change the metrics of tunnel interfaces I can make the routers to prefer DSL with EIGRP. <br /><br />All DSL IPs are static Public and the 3G interface on the Hub is also stati. But spokes&#39; 3G IPs are dynamic.<br /><br />So my conundrum is,<br /><br />If I implement the secondary DMVPN as mentioned above, How am I going to configure default routes on the HUB?. ( I can have a specific route on the Spokes, pointing the HUB&#39;s 3G IP, out via it&#39;s 3G interface because I already know the HUB&#39;s 3G IP address(static).)But on the Hub, I already have a default route via DSL interface. Because the Spokes 3G IPs are dynamic, I can&#39;t specify a route on the Hub so that the Hub can reply to ISAKMP initiation traffic received from Spokes 3G-IP back via Hubs 3G interface. So even though hub gets the spokes initiation traffic(for secondary DMVPN) from it&#39;s 3G interface, it&#39;s gonna reply using it&#39;s DSL interface ( is it ?). So I think this may cause lots of issues..<br /><br />Can you please put me in the right direction.. May be there is a better way. This has been a pain in the back side for too long now.<br /><br />Thank you in advance.<br />",
