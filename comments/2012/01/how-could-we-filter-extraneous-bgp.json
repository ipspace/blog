      "html": "First I would consider if a full table really is necessary. Do you use it because of business needs? Many times it&#39;s enough to use default routes or just receive peering prefixes and use a default for the rest. If you really need the full table then there should be money to get new hardware.<br /><br />I assume that nothing smaller than /24 is being received? You could take it one step further by filtering anything smaller than a /23. Yes, you would loose some minor prefixes but do you really need them? Maybe you could use a default route for those prefixes. Otherwise you could try to do something a bit more clever. If you know that you will never need to send traffic to Asia or some part of the world then you could try to filter ranges allocated to APAC. It will not be 100% accurate but close enough.<br /><br />SUP720-3B is very old by now so it might be time for an upgrade anyway but I know it can be difficult getting money allocated.",

Should they already be dropped on the edge device or should the edge device receive them and simply not forward these prefixes to the internal routers?<br />For the second case, you could probably mess arround with some conditional advertisement. For the first case, some feature like &quot;conditional automatic aggregation&quot; would be a cool thing, but it doesn&#39;t exist afaik (at least in IOS).

Although they won&#39;t go into the routing table, the 720s still have to process each one of it, so I still wonder if that will be enough to protect the device.<br /><br />If he has full-table-capable routers near the 720s, he can originate a default-route from the router and suboptimal routing should stay near enough.",

      "html": "Few thoughts:<br /><br />1. The best &#39;PC&#39; based BGP implementation is currently OpenBGPD (run on on OpenBSD) . No serious BGP engineer can afford to ignore it these days. Even has MPLS &amp; VRF support.<br /><br />2. Not sure which of the 3B&#39;s resources you are specifically discussing, but soft-reconfiguration would double some memory requirements for each peer, so that is unlikely to be feasible anyway.<br /><br />3. Standard tricks in this situation are to implement prefix length filtering e.g. drop &gt; /24, if that still doesn&#39;t fit, then &gt; /23 etc. Maybe throw in a static default to null, and then judiciously log non-RFC5735 packets that go there to see who&#39;s not aggregating.<br /><br />4. In the end the 3B can&#39;t cut the mustard anymore. Especially if it&#39;s holding v6 tables as well. If you have traffic to justify the peerings, then you can presumably afford the 3CXL (or whatever). Otherwise see (1.) for alternative cheaper option..",

He can definitely use routing policies to limit the to limit the prefixes he accepts, but we do not know what prefixes he is concerned about. I mean, that is what BGP is all about right? Making a decision on the best path, given a number of paths to the same destination from different sources. Does he have multiple conections to different or the same AS? If he has a single connection a provider, then using BGP is...hmmm...dont know. Again, not knowing the set up is a problem. If only one connection, then set a default route to the internet and firewall filters for any specific policy you want to enforce. Then have the provider only advertise a single aggregate to you.",
