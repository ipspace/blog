            <div class="comment-content">simpler solution: <br /><br />have multiple dmvpn hubs and spokes and multiple ISP on each side <br />to connect it together we need dedicated VRF for each ISP (outside VRFs) and dedicated VRF for each tunnel-interface (inside VRFs). then, configuring each tunnel-interface as usual and redistributing routes between inside VRFs via BGP. <br /><br />with this scheme we have all possible connectivity between any number of hubs and spokes with any number of ISP connections each. <br /><br />P.S.: sorry for bad english.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I&#39;ve been trying to find a solution for this scenario for last three months.<br /><br />I have 3 routers each one has ADSL and 3G interfaces. one of them will be a hub and the other two will be spokes. What is the best way to have redundancy for this topology?. I am thinking of configuring 2 DMVPN clouds, one on the DSL and other on the 3G. I know that, if I change the metrics of tunnel interfaces I can make the routers to prefer DSL with EIGRP. <br /><br />All DSL IPs are static Public and the 3G interface on the Hub is also stati. But spokes&#39; 3G IPs are dynamic.<br /><br />So my conundrum is,<br /><br />If I implement the secondary DMVPN as mentioned above, How am I going to configure default routes on the HUB?. ( I can have a specific route on the Spokes, pointing the HUB&#39;s 3G IP, out via it&#39;s 3G interface because I already know the HUB&#39;s 3G IP address(static).)But on the Hub, I already have a default route via DSL interface. Because the Spokes 3G IPs are dynamic, I can&#39;t specify a route on the Hub so that the Hub can reply to ISAKMP initiation traffic received from Spokes 3G-IP back via Hubs 3G interface. So even though hub gets the spokes initiation traffic(for secondary DMVPN) from it&#39;s 3G interface, it&#39;s gonna reply using it&#39;s DSL interface ( is it ?). So I think this may cause lots of issues..<br /><br />Can you please put me in the right direction.. May be there is a better way. This has been a pain in the back side for too long now.<br /><br />Thank you in advance.<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">I went through your material. Very informative and spot on. Just one thing I want to clarify regarding the above scenario, My spokes need local Internet access ( normal NAT overload). In your videos you recommend to use different VRFs for ISP uplinks and not to use PBR.  <br /><br />So my question is, can I use VRFs and still allow internal users to access internet without going through the hub? <br />What would be my best option here..??<br />Thanks a lot for taking time for this. :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Use a separate VRF for every Internet uplink, global routing table for your internal network. Default route in each VRF points to the corresponding uplink. Internet routing solved.<br /><br />Next, add a default route in the global routing table pointing to one of the Internet uplinks (you MUST include interface in the static route), and configure inter-VRF NAT. <br /><br />Shameless plug: inter-VRF NAT is described in details (together with router configs) in Enterprise MPLS/VPN webinar and my MPLS/VPN books.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Thanks so much Ivan. Will do that. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to buy the MPLS/VPN series as well.. because I&#39;m pretty sure they are as good as DMVPN ones. Lot to learn. Totally worth the money ! </div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi,<br /><br />I have a bunch of Spoke&#39;s in my Dual Hub Design. And i get the phenomenon that some of them won&#39;t reconnect to the HUB. ( DMVPN Config is all the same) The &quot;sh dmvpn&quot; command shows me &quot;NHRP&quot; and they get stucked. After dis/en -able all works fine. Any suggestions ?</div>
