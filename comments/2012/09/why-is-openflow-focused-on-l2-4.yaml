  html: Hi Ivan<br /><br /><br />There is a use case for openflow for SLB.<br />I
    agree it is not for full L4-L7 SLB but for L4 only SLB openflow can create 400Gbps
    SLB for 20K$.<br />You can take a look at FlowScale for example<br /><br />Nitzan

  html: At my employer (old) we used route-maps to implement load balancing into our
    server farms for selected traffic. We didn&#39;t pass all traffic through because
    of througput would kill the LBs.. I could see openflow working perfectly for this.
    If I could have the LB manager program the flows instead of having to do it via
    route-maps that would be ideal.<br /><br />Cisco was going to come out with SIA,
    but that has been a pipedream for a few years now.

  html: 'Ivan, <br />thanks for editing our chat. Actually, you state something interesting
    to debate: <br />&quot;However, appliance configuration and programming is a totally
    different problem that cannot be solved with OpenFlow.&quot;<br /><br />So far
    I agree, but to my mind, having an evolution of the openflow architecture and
    protocols to take care about L4-L7 services would be something to look at as a
    standardization.<br /><br />Carriers would love focusing on L4-L7 standardization
    to enable the network monetization and provide differentiation. <br />Getting
    L2-L3 programmibility as an openflow standard is fine and can give you TCO savings
    but for the business growth, network monetization associated with L4-L7 programmibility
    is even better.<br />In the 3GPP world, there is the PCC technical specification
    TS23.203 which standardizes the policy/rule management control (PCRF) from the
    enforcement function (PCEF). I would love seeing a discussion in the openflow
    to converge both worlds. <br />Anyway, I am pushing for this in the ONF :)<br
    />Thanks!'

  html: working for Radware - i think that SDN offers a great opportunity to leverage
    network assets in such a way that greatly enhances the scalability of a load balancing
    solution. L4 can certainly be offloaded to the network (similarly to FlowScale)
    and upper layers continue to run through ADC appliances.<br />the game is not
    an API to the appliance. the game is about an application that works together
    with the appliance and programs the SDN. that is where customers will start seeing
    the value of SDN.
