      "html": "I agree that people in IT have to continue their education as the industry evolves.  Networkers of ye olde had to evolve from token ring to ethernet.  At that time though the person best suited to run the new ethernet networks was the guy running the old token ring networks.  <br /><br />In terms of the data center, who is the best suited to run the software defined networks?  Is it the network engineer, the sys admin, the vmware admin?  As I soley run data centers it&#39;s these questions that have me worried about my future job secuity.  When a vmware admin can just push a button to enable a firewall, a load balancer, and a wan accelerator - I believe that management may begin to wonder why that vmware admin cant just manage the appliances as well.<br /><br />Cisco, of course, is trying their darndest to keep roles for everyone - ensuring responsibilities (serucity for vasa, networks for 1KV, vmware for vmware, storage for storage, etc).  But I see a shift (back) to the jack of all trades engineer.  I believe that there will be a handfull of people in each data center who have access to and know how to do everything pretty damn well.<br /><br />Advanded troubleshooting will be relegated to the vendor.  --- some may scoff at that ::: but when was the last time you&#39;ve seen a storage guy toubleshoot an advanced issue on his own?

I really DO NOT see any hand-coding requriement for Production grade SDNs...So SDN programmer role may not be a HOT case like it was for CCIEs long ago.<br /><br />Enterprises will simply go in for Vendor developed SDN apps like VMware and Microsoft 2012 SDN...YOU REALLY DO NOT NEED A network Programmer role per se..except for some LAB/Acedemic implementations...so the best programmers will be absorbed by VMware or MSFT.<br /><br />So I would see Network ADmins, CCIEs moving to VM roles..and hence a great competetion CLASH between seasoned VMadmin and Network enggs..The person who will be able to understand and handle both technologies will WIN. Also the combined role will also not offer pays like what CCIEs/CCNPs/JNCIEs are used to...so ECONOMY will take a HIT....leading to fewer admin positons...Enggs from both realms (VM/Netadmin) will take hits.<br /><br />The only other option for us Cisco/Juni fans is to have a firm foot still in traditonal networking while exploring SDN and keeping a watchful and hopeful eye on Cisco/Juni developments on the SDN front.<br /><br />Also Enterprises do not need the total elasticity that SDNs offer..<br />WHere do we see the need for dynamic changes to the network core day to day?<br /><br />Also cheap network devices and Open source options are still available w.r.t traditional networks, but companies have settled on Cisco/Juni.<br />As of today SDN makes sense only with cloud providers.<br />",

Of course some perceive this as &quot;clever&quot; w/o consideration for whoose agenda it serves.<br />In many places education on Networking has been replaced by a  &quot;vendor symbiote creation process&quot;.<br /><br />A form of vendor self perpetuation wearing a mantle of education in &quot;Networking Academies&quot;. It is as if academic institutions are becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of vendors.<br />What we should be hiring are people with Computer and Networking Education not vendor symbiotes.<br />P.S.<br />There is nothing wrong with being a vendor symbiote but it must be recognized that it is a skewed perspective.",

There is a shift away from individual roles towards the &#39;jack of all trades&#39; and I think it is moving this way for a number of reasons including a) people are seeing the inefficencies of needing multiple people&#39;s input to complete simple or common tasks b) the technology demarcation point is getting narrower all the time and c) technologies/features are becoming simpler to deploy so you don&#39;t need to have someone focused entirely on a single area.  In terms of certifications I think they are good for vendors and partners but their worth to the individual is diminishing.<br />",

However, in terms of Cisco I don&#39;t believe the breakaway from VMware to Openstack is a good idea at all. Not being on the VMware &quot;advanced networking&quot; framework like other 3rd parties are (riverbed,F5 etc) is a bad move. If Cisco really to go war with VMware (seems they are drawing a line in the sand already) I think products like UCS will fail, and that might really affect Cisco, marketshare and then you might question going to far with Cisco exams. <br /><br />It will certainly be interesting to see what happens now. If VMware did buy Juniper, Cisco might really be up against it in terms of the data centre. <br /><br />",
