It runs as an active/backup pair of VMs across the physically disjointed compute nodes in the QFabric Director cluster.<br /> <br />QFabric Director compute clusters are composed of two compute nodes, each running identical software stacks. <br />(although the current implementation supports a maximum of two compute nodes per cluster, the architecture can theoretically support multiple servers.) Two of the compute nodes have a disk subsystem directly attached to them; the remaining compute nodes are diskless and therefore essentially stateless. each disk subsystem consists of two 2 Tb disks arranged in a raID1 mirror configuration, and the contents across these subsystems are synchronously block replicated for redundancy.",
