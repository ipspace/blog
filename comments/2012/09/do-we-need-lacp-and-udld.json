I&#39;ve tested with and without UDLD on fiber links and the results were the same, which is that the links go down when the link is uni-directional.<br /><br />I believe there is a requirement to have the links in auto-negotiation mode, but that is 99% of the implementations out there. On the 1% that don&#39;t do auto-negotiation this is typically to a carrier who wouldn&#39;t run UDLD to the CE anyways.<br /><br />Perhaps it was needed on FastE back in the day??<br /><br />I&#39;ve been searching as to why this is needed. Many other vendors don&#39;t even have a feature like this and don&#39;t intend to implement it because of the reason I stated above, it&#39;s built into the GigE standards.",
