  html: Yes, it&#39;s a true story what you say, it seems like we&#39;re back in 80&#39;s
    and the problem of standardization of programming languages i.e.<br />One organization
    needs to take place over here and start a standard for all the following SDN APIs.
    It happens to C before ANSI C reach us and now it&#39;s happening here. <br />Other
    solution could be a compiler (like gcc) for all the platforms that want to support
    SND (joking but it wouldn&#39;t be strange at all that someone think in this as
    a possible solution).<br />Thanks for share to the rest of the world this enormous
    problem that no ones cares about.

    html: Google for the &quot;umbrella (network)? management system&quot; and read
      the fine white papers you get in the results. You&#39;ll get the idea ;)

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Please can you briefly explain &quot;umbrella network
    management&quot; for those people like me that have not heard of this before.<br
    /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Mark.

  html: Nice post Ivan, reading it really got my wheels turning on something. If the
    attempt at southbound standardization falls apart, the Northbound primitives would
    be the last stand but in some miracle that the NB API became homogenous across
    vendors it could still be crushed on the whim of a vendor controlling the API
    or DK. Hell Twitter sorta did that a couple of weeks ago. <br /><br />I think
    people are and will be more so interested in OF or anything standard as soon as
    products start getting developed. Few can manage DevOps or the buzzword coming
    out now NetOps. Haven&#39;t we had NetOps for years? How much silicon can vendor
    x y z convince us is needed in edge equipment is something I am wrangling with.
    I reckon Quantum is I think the first NB &quot;ecosystem&quot; api, and that came
    from grass roots, maybe it is doable. In that case the Quantum API is only as
    effective as the vendors commitment to developing product hooks into their gear
    which are all wildly different. Anything but horizontalization. Great post!

    html: I had OnePK in mind ... and to be precise, Cisco has announced it will have
      OnePK. Haven&#39;t seen it yet.

  html: Ivan, I believe Cisco has OnePK to address this, correct?

  html: "Nice blog.<br />I agree that it would be highly desirable to have the API\u2019\
    s published but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s critical to standardize them. We don\u2019\
    t have standard API\u2019s across any type of operating system today (server,\
    \ PC, tablet, smartphone), so one could argue why it should be done only for network\
    \ o/s\u2019s. API\u2019s related to OF will likely converge to some extent and\
    \ apps will figure out a way to be portable across multiple controllers.<br /><br\
    \ />I\u2019m sure no controller vendor wants to remain just the &quot;man-in-the-middle&quot;.\
    \ The apps provide the real value and every controller vendor will therefore want\
    \ to have their own apps. Maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s holding back publishing\
    \ of the APIs. Of course the reasons you\u2019ve mentioned likely hold as well.<br\
    \ />"

  html: 'Since we are entering software world, then why not use the standard software
    methods to get around multiplicity of APIs. We need an App Server on top of controllers
    that interfaces with the various controllers and offers an IDE to the developers
    essentially hiding the controller eccentricities from the app developer. '
