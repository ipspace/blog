  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Both switches also support NAT...<br />My feeling is that
    the ASIC is that this is more a customized ASIC based on a merchant ASIC than
    a custom homemade ASIC.<br /><br />Fabian

  html: these latency games are all about automated trading. this is probably the
    most important application for these boxes.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Last time I checked, the latency crown was held by Gnodal,
    they advertise sub-150 ns cut-through switching latency.<br />http://www.gnodal.com/Products/GS-Series/<br
    /><br />Not really sure if 50-100 ns makes that much difference, but HFT people
    are really shaving off microseconds here and there. Actual production network
    (server-server) is usually Infiniband with RDMA and other stuff.<br />Some reading
    on low-latency infra, if you&#39;re interested (it&#39;s PPT, unfortunately) -
    http://www.informatix-sol.com/docs/LowLatency101.pdf<br />A little dated, perhaps,
    but mostly still relevant.

    html: Can&#39;t deep-dive, that&#39;s all the information I got. <br /><br />MAC
      tables are usually organized as either TCAMs or hash tables. In both cases,
      accessing larger table might take an extra (hardware) step, resulting in higher
      latency. Just guessing.

    html: Actually, imagine a packet shows up on all interfaces at the same time,
      since you can only look up one packet at a time in the mac table what &#39;warp&#39;
      drive does is split the mac table into 8 tables where all the entries are replicated.
      This way you can lookup 8 packets in parallel. Meaning that for a 48 port switch
      each replicated table will serve 6 input ports so a given packet at worst case
      will have to wait for 5 lookup to get it&#39;s turn.

    html: Also there are collisions in hash tables (in fact it consists in hash tables
      where entries are chained lists); then the algorithm is just a sequential lookup
      in the list bound to a specific entry.

  html: 'Hi Ivan.<br /><br />You say in your blogpost that : &quot;The trick to reduced
    latency is reduced MAC table size: 8K addresses in warp mode.&quot; <br /><br
    />What does reducing the MAC table really do on the silicon ? I mean the buffer
    for indexing the MAC addresses will be smaller but where the extra space is going
    ? <br /><br />Short summary: Can you deep dive in this please and enlighten me
    ? :) <br /><br />Many thanks  ! <br /><br />Nic'

      with a breakout cable. Their data sheet claims a total of 64 ports.

      (and you&#39;d have to be in cut-through switching anyway to notice the difference).

    html: Gee, I&#39;ve been saying that since the &#39;90s when some cisco course
      (MPLS) said that routing is slower... at the same time showing how CEF does
      L3 switching. Vmware did not like/support vMotion because of latency too. Myths
      ? :)

    html: In those days MPLS was marginally faster, as it took a single linear table
      lookup versus multiple N-ary tree/trie lookups for IP.<br /><br />As for vMotion
      over L3, see http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/09/vmotion-enhancements-in-vsphere.html

  html: 'Nx3548: Warp mode to further reduce latency to 190 ns for small-to-midsize
    layer 2 and 3 deployments. That always clicks a two sided argument in my head:
    is L3 slower than L2 in any account ? Even if doing hardware switching, you need
    to read more to make the call, and you have to rewrite/recalc. On the other hand,
    the difference might amount to a couple of meters of fiber ? :) <br />'
