            <div class="comment-content">Yes, it&#39;s a true story what you say, it seems like we&#39;re back in 80&#39;s and the problem of standardization of programming languages i.e.<br />One organization needs to take place over here and start a standard for all the following SDN APIs. It happens to C before ANSI C reach us and now it&#39;s happening here. <br />Other solution could be a compiler (like gcc) for all the platforms that want to support SND (joking but it wouldn&#39;t be strange at all that someone think in this as a possible solution).<br />Thanks for share to the rest of the world this enormous problem that no ones cares about.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Nice post Ivan, reading it really got my wheels turning on something. If the attempt at southbound standardization falls apart, the Northbound primitives would be the last stand but in some miracle that the NB API became homogenous across vendors it could still be crushed on the whim of a vendor controlling the API or DK. Hell Twitter sorta did that a couple of weeks ago. <br /><br />I think people are and will be more so interested in OF or anything standard as soon as products start getting developed. Few can manage DevOps or the buzzword coming out now NetOps. Haven&#39;t we had NetOps for years? How much silicon can vendor x y z convince us is needed in edge equipment is something I am wrangling with. I reckon Quantum is I think the first NB &quot;ecosystem&quot; api, and that came from grass roots, maybe it is doable. In that case the Quantum API is only as effective as the vendors commitment to developing product hooks into their gear which are all wildly different. Anything but horizontalization. Great post!</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Nice blog.<br />I agree that it would be highly desirable to have the API’s published but I’m not sure it’s critical to standardize them. We don’t have standard API’s across any type of operating system today (server, PC, tablet, smartphone), so one could argue why it should be done only for network o/s’s. API’s related to OF will likely converge to some extent and apps will figure out a way to be portable across multiple controllers.<br /><br />I’m sure no controller vendor wants to remain just the &quot;man-in-the-middle&quot;. The apps provide the real value and every controller vendor will therefore want to have their own apps. Maybe that’s what’s holding back publishing of the APIs. Of course the reasons you’ve mentioned likely hold as well.<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">Since we are entering software world, then why not use the standard software methods to get around multiplicity of APIs. We need an App Server on top of controllers that interfaces with the various controllers and offers an IDE to the developers essentially hiding the controller eccentricities from the app developer. </div>
