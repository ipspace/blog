            <div class="comment-content">nice post Ivan, i found myself in the same troubles, but the only truth is that time is not enough, got no time to watch your webinars! this kind of choices must also be weighted by available free time, money, willingness. it could also be a good time to invest in the &quot;vendor-neutral&quot; ccde, so the parameters are at the end: time, money, willigness, coolness...  where SDN is the cool&#39;ish one ;)<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">I agree that people in IT have to continue their education as the industry evolves.  Networkers of ye olde had to evolve from token ring to ethernet.  At that time though the person best suited to run the new ethernet networks was the guy running the old token ring networks.  <br /><br />In terms of the data center, who is the best suited to run the software defined networks?  Is it the network engineer, the sys admin, the vmware admin?  As I soley run data centers it&#39;s these questions that have me worried about my future job secuity.  When a vmware admin can just push a button to enable a firewall, a load balancer, and a wan accelerator - I believe that management may begin to wonder why that vmware admin cant just manage the appliances as well.<br /><br />Cisco, of course, is trying their darndest to keep roles for everyone - ensuring responsibilities (serucity for vasa, networks for 1KV, vmware for vmware, storage for storage, etc).  But I see a shift (back) to the jack of all trades engineer.  I believe that there will be a handfull of people in each data center who have access to and know how to do everything pretty damn well.<br /><br />Advanded troubleshooting will be relegated to the vendor.  --- some may scoff at that ::: but when was the last time you&#39;ve seen a storage guy toubleshoot an advanced issue on his own?  </div>

            <div class="comment-content">I support Will&#39;s comments... I really DO NOT see any hand-coding requriement for Production grade SDNs...So SDN programmer role may not be a HOT case like it was for CCIEs long ago.<br /><br />Enterprises will simply go in for Vendor developed SDN apps like VMware and Microsoft 2012 SDN...YOU REALLY DO NOT NEED A network Programmer role per se..except for some LAB/Acedemic implementations...so the best programmers will be absorbed by VMware or MSFT.<br /><br />So I would see Network ADmins, CCIEs moving to VM roles..and hence a great competetion CLASH between seasoned VMadmin and Network enggs..The person who will be able to understand and handle both technologies will WIN. Also the combined role will also not offer pays like what CCIEs/CCNPs/JNCIEs are used to...so ECONOMY will take a HIT....leading to fewer admin positons...Enggs from both realms (VM/Netadmin) will take hits.<br /><br />The only other option for us Cisco/Juni fans is to have a firm foot still in traditonal networking while exploring SDN and keeping a watchful and hopeful eye on Cisco/Juni developments on the SDN front.<br /><br />Also Enterprises do not need the total elasticity that SDNs offer..<br />WHere do we see the need for dynamic changes to the network core day to day?<br /><br />Also cheap network devices and Open source options are still available w.r.t traditional networks, but companies have settled on Cisco/Juni.<br />As of today SDN makes sense only with cloud providers.<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">A slightly different &quot;non kool-aid drinkers&quot; perspective:<br />At some point in the past we were taught Networking.<br />Then we got into the co-option of technical education programs via vendor &quot;sponsorship and goodwill&quot;. Of course some perceive this as &quot;clever&quot; w/o consideration for whoose agenda it serves.<br />In many places education on Networking has been replaced by a  &quot;vendor symbiote creation process&quot;.<br /><br />A form of vendor self perpetuation wearing a mantle of education in &quot;Networking Academies&quot;. It is as if academic institutions are becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of vendors.<br />What we should be hiring are people with Computer and Networking Education not vendor symbiotes.<br />P.S.<br />There is nothing wrong with being a vendor symbiote but it must be recognized that it is a skewed perspective.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Being a vendor symboite helps retain my foot firmly..CCIE certs etc...<br /><br />You have a &#39;Go-to&#39; Domain....YOU KNOW WHAT TO LEARN AND PROCEED in a cetain direction...<br /><br />and Cisco is not the only vendor who has symboites..what about MicroSoft? It has much of the IT world as its symboites..?<br /><br />Also when the SDN dust settles down, IT WILL BE MS and not VMWARE/anyone else in SDN..no hand coding programmers required for every company utilizing SDN. So you will again have Symboites and not network pros...huh..and you will not have any say, Darlings...<br /><br />SDN enggs will not be any Network pros...just point and click vm guys ppl banking on the SDN vendor (VMWARE/MS) for support.<br /><br />There is no BIG pics..dear..whatever MS/Cisco/Juni gives, that will be it.<br /><br />This SDN does not have a single vendor direction as of now...way too confusing.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I think if you are currently an infrastructure architect or engineer you are in a good place right now.  There is a shift away from individual roles towards the &#39;jack of all trades&#39; and I think it is moving this way for a number of reasons including a) people are seeing the inefficencies of needing multiple people&#39;s input to complete simple or common tasks b) the technology demarcation point is getting narrower all the time and c) technologies/features are becoming simpler to deploy so you don&#39;t need to have someone focused entirely on a single area.  In terms of certifications I think they are good for vendors and partners but their worth to the individual is diminishing.<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">I have gone through various SDN topics and documentations..<br /><br />But the scene is far from Rosy, too many differing and vendor specific implementations, better rename SDN to VDN (Vendor Defined Network). SNF is doing little to address the mess.<br /><br />If each SDCC gets implemented in its own way, it would make SDN less-Sexy for Enterprises to look at and may give enough time for Cisco and others to get away.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I agree Enterprises may not adopt the SDN, cloud provider most certainly will. However, in terms of Cisco I don&#39;t believe the breakaway from VMware to Openstack is a good idea at all. Not being on the VMware &quot;advanced networking&quot; framework like other 3rd parties are (riverbed,F5 etc) is a bad move. If Cisco really to go war with VMware (seems they are drawing a line in the sand already) I think products like UCS will fail, and that might really affect Cisco, marketshare and then you might question going to far with Cisco exams. <br /><br />It will certainly be interesting to see what happens now. If VMware did buy Juniper, Cisco might really be up against it in terms of the data centre. <br /><br /></div>
