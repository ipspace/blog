            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan<br /><br /><br />There is a use case for openflow for SLB.<br />I agree it is not for full L4-L7 SLB but for L4 only SLB openflow can create 400Gbps SLB for 20K$.<br />You can take a look at FlowScale for example<br /><br />Nitzan</div>

            <div class="comment-content">At my employer (old) we used route-maps to implement load balancing into our server farms for selected traffic. We didn&#39;t pass all traffic through because of througput would kill the LBs.. I could see openflow working perfectly for this. If I could have the LB manager program the flows instead of having to do it via route-maps that would be ideal.<br /><br />Cisco was going to come out with SIA, but that has been a pipedream for a few years now.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan, <br />thanks for editing our chat. Actually, you state something interesting to debate: <br />&quot;However, appliance configuration and programming is a totally different problem that cannot be solved with OpenFlow.&quot;<br /><br />So far I agree, but to my mind, having an evolution of the openflow architecture and protocols to take care about L4-L7 services would be something to look at as a standardization.<br /><br />Carriers would love focusing on L4-L7 standardization to enable the network monetization and provide differentiation. <br />Getting L2-L3 programmibility as an openflow standard is fine and can give you TCO savings but for the business growth, network monetization associated with L4-L7 programmibility is even better.<br />In the 3GPP world, there is the PCC technical specification TS23.203 which standardizes the policy/rule management control (PCRF) from the enforcement function (PCEF). I would love seeing a discussion in the openflow to converge both worlds. <br />Anyway, I am pushing for this in the ONF :)<br />Thanks!</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Zdravo Ivan !<br />It is the best networking blog I know! Reflecting your deep understanding of modern networks...<br />As far as I understand we can expect Cisco Controller to have Plugins that will program any virtual device, like virtual appliances..<br />Sa≈°a</div>

            <div class="comment-content">working for Radware - i think that SDN offers a great opportunity to leverage network assets in such a way that greatly enhances the scalability of a load balancing solution. L4 can certainly be offloaded to the network (similarly to FlowScale) and upper layers continue to run through ADC appliances.<br />the game is not an API to the appliance. the game is about an application that works together with the appliance and programs the SDN. that is where customers will start seeing the value of SDN.</div>
