    html: Depending on the failure, the stack may split. If LACP is being used, the
      peer switch detects the stack split, or just the lack of LACP frames, and forms
      two separate port-channels, after which STP kicks in and blocks one link.<br
      />If it&#39;s a static port-channel, it does not detect the stack split and
      keeps on forwarding on one port-channels towards two logical devices, and loops
      can form.

  html: Why would one even question that? Try connection a port-channel to a stack
    of switches without LACP, then see a stack member failing. You&#39;ll learn fast.

      way ?

  html: I&#39;ve struggled to understand why we even need UDLD. 10GigE and GigE have
    detection mechanisms built into it. I&#39;ve tested with and without UDLD on fiber
    links and the results were the same, which is that the links go down when the
    link is uni-directional.<br /><br />I believe there is a requirement to have the
    links in auto-negotiation mode, but that is 99% of the implementations out there.
    On the 1% that don&#39;t do auto-negotiation this is typically to a carrier who
    wouldn&#39;t run UDLD to the CE anyways.<br /><br />Perhaps it was needed on FastE
    back in the day??<br /><br />I&#39;ve been searching as to why this is needed.
    Many other vendors don&#39;t even have a feature like this and don&#39;t intend
    to implement it because of the reason I stated above, it&#39;s built into the
    GigE standards.

  html: 'Anony, you might be confusing copper and fiber?<br /><br />This doesn&#39;t
    affect Copper.<br />goog hit #1:<br />The various fiber optic Ethernet standards
    (10 Mbps 10BASE-F, 100 Mbps 100BASE-FX and 1000 Mbps 1000BASE-X) use different
    wavelengths of optical signaling which made it impossible to come up with an Auto-Negotiation
    signaling system that would work across all three.<br /><br />As such UDLD is/was
    needed.'

    html: LACP will detect unidirectional links. Will it detect them fast enough?
      That&#39;s where you enter the gray land of It Depends.<br /><br />If you&#39;re
      OK with 90+ second time-to-recovery or can turn on LACP short timers (= they&#39;re
      supported by both ends of the link), you&#39;re all set ... unless running LACP
      with short timers overloads the 8088 CPU your vendor put in a 500-port switch
      (just joking, but do check the CPU utilization).

    html: If you do not have bundles, you should not need UDLD with FP. There is FP
      ISIS to take care of any soft failures and its bidirectional protocol, just
      like all L3 protocols are.

  html: What about a TRILL (FabricPath) setup? You can make all your aggregated links
    just point-to-point links, then you do not need LACP at all. Use this in combination
    with link fault signaling (LFS) and you do not need UDLD/LACP??????

    html: As I said in the article - if you can&#39;t run LACP with short timers (for
      whatever reason), UDLD gives you a faster alternative.

    html: It potentially gives you a faster response using Cisco proprietary technologies.  I
      always find it fascinating how individuals with almost exclusive Cisco backgrounds
      think this way.<br /><br />IMHO, if the vendor can&#39;t support an easy 1 second
      timer (and let&#39;s assume they have clock randomization so the timers don&#39;t
      all sync lock, which adds more overhead) across 100s of ports because the CPU
      they are using (for numerous functions) is the cheapest one they could find,
      find another vendor.

    way - do we need UDLD on top of LACP?
