  html: Yes, some of us care very much and are very happy to see continued progress
    in the level of IPv6 support in our gear, and in the continued progress in actual-deployment.

  html: Good to hear it is happening in some places, shameful in the others. I guess
    it just reflects the reaction to demand but you would have thought this could
    be forecasted since IANA posts nice graphs on a linear race to zero. Missing protocol
    support for basics like PE-CE ISIS &amp; OSPF still baffles me too. LDPv4 will
    be a welcome addition if it ever gets out of the IETF.<br />For what its worth
    I learned most of what I know regarding v6 from your videos. That makes you a
    borg Ivan :)

  html: 'We had a public tender over one year ago for a huge wireless controller based
    wifi solution. A lot of vendors took part. One requirement was not only a dual
    stack on wifi controller and access points but also carrying IPv6 packets over
    the tunnel between access points and controller.<br /><br />Well one vendor was
    quit inexpensive with its products. Of course we asked him about the requested
    IPv6 support, because IPv6 was not mentioned it its manuals or datasheets.<br
    /><br />Of course he exceused himself, the responsible employee must have overseen
    that topic, but he promised that IPv6 will be implemented soon.<br /><br />Fortunately,
    that one was thrown out. (There were other topics, i.e. no active directory integration,...)
    Looking at its datasheets he is now advertising IPv6 for its wireless controllers.
    Looking at the manual you can find that the controller itself can now be given
    an IPv6 adress for management, but no dual stack for its access points, no IPv6
    traffic being transfered over tunnel.<br />(side note: If you let such a vendor
    win the public tender, he is no longer commmitted to fulfill those requirements,
    as he admited those ones, although he promised to do so. Strange? No, public tenders
    in my country...)<br /><br />Lessons learned:<br />- check &quot;IPv6 support&quot;<br
    />- vendors will you tell a lot, only to sell you its products<br />- never do
    a public tender'

  html: Dell SonicWall has an ancient &quot;feature release&quot; with limited IPv6
    support, but no way to upgrade or downgrade to it from a recent release. So a
    full rebuild of all firewall rules would be necessary.<br />For two years support
    had been saying IPv6 in v5.8 or newer was coming soon, but still nothing. Major
    fail.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Enjoy the site! You may have forgotten about 100.64.0.0/10
    defined in RFC6598 while not as large as a /8 this space is guaranteed not to
    overlap. Not solving the problem with lack of v6 support but making transitional
    mechanisms... easier

  html: Check IPv6 support but also kick the tires in a lab. You would be surprised
    how many products say IPv6 supported but are not fully baked. Critical RFC items
    not supported. You have to flush them out first before even thinking of production
    deployment. <br />For security devices I used a tool to craft custom IPv6 packets
    to beat up on devices to see how the protocol behaved and used this to test ACL
    processing and logging too. <br /><br />Some examples from last spring:<br />Infoblox
    DNS appliance stated IPv6 support but didn&#39;t support some important RFCs.
    Also, if you changed the IPv6 address it bounced the IPv4 services too, not good
    for production. We were basically debugging their product in the lab and they
    corrected some of the items in the 6.4 code.<br />Mcafee 8.x firewall code. Certain
    EH passed through when chained and important alerts were not logged or mislogged
    giving false information. Discovered a fragment reassembly FSM time exceed exploit
    etc.<br />Clunky rules for FTP and DNS handling, host and router mode limitations.<br

  html: "Also, here is a Cisco example just to share with the gang:<br />Cisco ASR\
    \ IOS XE. 3.0.2 IPv6 ACL and TCAM bug I included to share with the gang.<br />\
    \ One is the ACL with IPV6 and the second issue is the side effect that caused\
    \ the crash.   The crash happened after adding ipv6 ACL failed and it tried to\
    \ restore the old ACL which it\u2019s not suppose to do. In attempting to restore\
    \ the old ACL, it triggered a crash.  Thus, I\u2019ve filed a bug against the\
    \ crash.  the bug id is CSCua03521.  It\u2019s been assigned to a DE already.\
    \  There is no ETA on the fix.  You can view the bug with bugtool http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/Support/Bugtool/home.pl\
    \ <br />As for the ACL\u2019s, there is a workaround by re-arrange the ACE\u2019\
    s so that it won\u2019t trigger the failure.  Would you please send me the current\
    \ (new) running-config that you want to run?  The contents of new ACE\u2019s that\
    \ you want to add IPV6 ACL\u2019s is important. <br />From the show tech output\
    \ on May 2nd, 2012, the ACE with sequence number 440 was causing the problem.\
    \ If you remove this ACE then you won\u2019t see the error tracebacks or crash\
    \ problem.   From show run output, not sure if ACE sequence 440 is needed since\
    \ you already have the following ACE in the ACL - deny ipv6 any any log routing\
    \ sequence 430. <br />ASR1K processes ACL in TCAM (hardware). The width of largest\
    \ TCAM entry is 320 bits. The IPV6 ACL src &amp; dst address alone takes 256 bits\
    \ of these 320. So there will not be enough space in the entry to add all possible\
    \ other acl matching fields. In order to accommodate all ACL fields we compress\
    \ IPV6 src &amp; dst address into 64 bits and program these compressed values\
    \ in TCAM. This compression algorithm has some known limitations.  Sometimes compression\
    \ of  address fails. This dependents upon the ipv6 address pattern, address prefix\
    \ length, order in which these ACEs are configured etc., To avoid this problem\
    \ for most commonly used  ACL fields, we program TCAM without compressing the\
    \ address. If you uses only following fields in your ACLs, then you never run\
    \ into this problem. <br />   - IPV6 src address <br />   - IPV6 dest address\
    \ <br />   - protocol field (ipv6, icmp, igmp, tcp, udp, ipinip, ipv6inip, gre,\
    \ nigrp, ospf, nos, pim, pcp, sctp) <br />   - (tos, dscp) or TCP flags  (not\
    \ both in the same ACL) <br />   - l4 src &amp; dest ports &amp; port ranges (TCP,\
    \ UDP  src &amp; dst ports) <br />   - ipv6 icmp header types (like pkt too big,\
    \ echo req etc.,) <br />   - ipv6  routing header presence <br />   - ipv6 destination\
    \ header presence (later versions code we replaced this with HBH). <br />   -\
    \ fragments <br />  <br />Original ACL has fields only from above list. So ASR1k\
    \ used uncompressed address in TCAM. During edit you added ACE with \u201Crouting-type\u201D\
    . This is not part of this list. So this change forced ASR1K to use compressed\
    \ ipv6 addresses in TCAM. During address compression we ran into this problem.\
    \ <br />Following are some options to avoid this problem <br />  <br />1.    Use\
    \ ACL fields given in the above list only. That means you have to remove ACE with\
    \ routing-type field.  As I mentioned before you do not need this as long as you\
    \ have \u201Cdeny ipv6 any any routing\u201D ACE in the ACL. <br />  <br />2.\
    \   Re-arrange the ACEs in the following way. This solves the problem but if you\
    \ add new ACEs this ACL then they may run into this problem again. <br />IPv6\
    \ access list Internet-Inbound <br />3.   Remove the ACE \u201Cdeny ipv6 any any\
    \ routing-type 0 log sequence 440\u201D from this ACL and create a separate ACL\
    \ with this ACE and apply it in outbound direction (if possible) <br />  <br />4.\
    \   Remove the ACE \u201Cdeny ipv6 any any routing-type 0 log sequence 440\u201D\
    \ and create a separate ACL. Create a QoS policy using this ACL. Use police actopm\
    \ to drop all these packets. Apply this to the interface in ingress dir along\
    \ with ACL. <br /><br />Regards.."

  html: Just to let you know, here at Arista we shipped our first releases with IPv6
    routing support this summer.  I&#39;m sorry if this was a bit hard to find in
    the documentation.  As of 4.10.1, we have hardware routing support for the 7500
    and 7050 switches along with MP-BGP and OSPFv3 protocol support.  The 7050s even
    got IPv6 ACL support.  We&#39;ll be fleshing out the protocol features and adding
    first hop router features like VRRPv3 for IPv6 and DHCPv6 relay in our upcoming
    releases.  <br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Adam Sweeney<br />

  html: Just one more <br />On the Cisco ASR IOS XE rev above reflective ACLs were
    not supported for IPv6. Could have come in handy.
