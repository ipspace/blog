      "html": "I thought so based on your comment on an earlier post. But this post seems to say that the 6WIND stack should be directly installed into each VM. Not that it&#39;s all that clear either way, but having a very strong virtualization background, I&#39;m reading into it to try to figure out the details and a good portion of the wording had me leaning towards it being installed into every VM. That would make it very limiting considering the dependency on physical NICs, as well as how that would break VM mobility.<br /><br />Anyway, if VM traffic is being funneled through a 6WIND virtual appliance of sorts, then this gets interesting. I imagine such an appliance would need to run on every host, sort of like an extension of the virtual switch. I&#39;m seen that setup before where each host has multiple vSwiches, one with physical uplinks and the appliance, and the other with the appliance (providing switching/routing capabilities) and the production VMs. <br /><br />Does this setup interfere with support for features such as vMotion/live migration?",

We still keep the communication with other VMs with no 6WINDGate (with e1000, VMXNet3,...)<br />There are 2 concerns with SW appliances run over virtualization: <br />- guest OS kernel over multicore does not scale linearly.<br />- hypervisor kernel brings performance penalties as well.<br /><br />We bring performance improvments there.
