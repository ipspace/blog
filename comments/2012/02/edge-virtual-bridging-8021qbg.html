            <div class="comment-content">While I tend to agree, I think that EVB will be a long term winner. My current favourite is a VEB using TRILL to connect to the network means no LAG, no STP, and a proper communication of state between server and the network. <br /><br />The IEEE is not serving it&#39;s community very well by taking so long over this.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">It&#39;s clear VLANs don&#39;t scale for very large environments, but I&#39;d say for the very large majority of deployments, they scale just fine.  So maybe EVB will have it&#39;s place in the market.  However, if the L2oIP solutions become easy enough to manage longer term for the average Joe, then why not use them for all designs and we can be done with VLAN trunks, etc.  As always time well tell.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I would be more visionnary here but I do think that NO virtualization is the long term winning solution...<br />If you look at the chip vendors architectures evolving fast, and the application architecture increasing you will be able in the coming years to consolidate apps &amp; networking on a same platform without hypervisors. Therefore coming back to more simple software architecture.<br />Hadoop-like solutions?  O:-)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Guest,<br />Being visionary is great and there are a lack of those folks out there that are...BUT...we can&#39;t do a full 180 over night throw away everything that&#39;s been done for 25+ yrs.  Gradual changes work best.  We&#39;ll see adoption of newer architectures from CSPs, large financials, hyper scale companies, and they will probably make their way into the Enterprise and then SMB, and into the home. We&#39;ll see.  That goes for everything @Cloudtoad has been talking about too.  It sounds great, but not realistic in the short term for the MAJORITY of environments out there.  Customers need validated designs that work and a support model that provides SLAs.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">@other Anon: If we were to find ourselves working back to the multiple-applications-on-one-OS/appserver model, it would just serve to feed my confirmation bias that everything good gets trounced in the market by slipshod cheap solutions, then we slowly and painfully work our way back to upgrading the dominant solutions to do all the things the better solution did in the first place, albeit with more cruft.  e.g. SCSI vs IDE-&gt;ATA-&gt;SATA and Firewire vs USB1-&gt;2-&gt;3.<br /><br />And we refuse to learn from history, so we are doomed to repeat it.<br /><br /></div>
