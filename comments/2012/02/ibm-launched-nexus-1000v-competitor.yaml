  html: It was only a matter of time before this market segment would receive more
    attention. IBM will certainly not be the last one.

  html: Agreed.  Yawn.  No OpenFlow?  Ok then.. what about Q-in-Q?  PBB?  I&#39;m
    ready for something new and different in the vSwitch space...  Nicira is already
    doing better.

  html: Very interesting. While IBM entering the space does give some validation to
    Cisco&#39;s efforts, the timing seems very late. The general feedback that I&#39;ve
    been hearing is that VMware&#39;s virtual switch has been closing the gap with
    Cisco and that with each upgrade of vSphere that Cisco is losing customers due
    to challenges with upgrades (and the solution has always on the expensive side,
    limiting overall adoption). It makes sense for IBM to be more active in edge-networking,
    we&#39;ll see if it has any impact on slowing its decline in bladeserver market
    share.

  html: Yep, spot on.  The Nexus 1000V was always a tough upsell in my experience,
    and an increasingly capable VMware VDS doesn&#39;t make it any easier.

  html: 'According to this document: http://bladenetwork.net/userfiles/file/VMReadyFAQ.pdf
    it&#39;s source MAC address snooping (similar to what Force10 is doing) and thus
    not even in the same universe as EVB.'

  html: 'Dear vendors:<br /><br />Making a vSwitch?  Impress me and do something different:
    PBB, Q-in-Q, or MPLS.  Otherwise give up now and adopt OpenFlow and let someone
    else do the networking like Nicira or Big Switch.  <br /><br />Thanks, bye.<br

  html: 'IEEE 802.1Qbg support is in the IBM Virtual Fabric 10G Switch Module (for
    BladeCenter H) starting with the 6.9.1 firmware. Check the Application Guide (Chapter
    16: Edge Virtual Bridging) at http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg3T7000496.
    VMReady 4.0 is this new Qbg based implementation. <br /><br />Qbg Support in KVM
    is achieved with macvtap (e.g. in RHEL &gt;= 6.1) and can be used with the IBM
    Virtual Fabric 10G Switch Module.<br /><br />P.S. The IBM Virtual Fabric Mode
    with Emulex 10GbE VFA (CNA) uses Q-in-Q techniques (check the Virtual Fabric Academy
    website at http://www.virtualfabric.net).<br /><br />much more to come  8-)'
