            <div class="comment-content">Interesting article as always, but it makes me doubt my current certification goals. If I want to specialize in Data Center, it seems that a CCIE is not the way to go anymore... And OpenFlow/vSwitch/VXLAN/... technologies are learned mostly on experience it seems.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ten+ years ago we threw out Newbridge (LAN) ATM because the Route Servers (central mgmt) couldn&#39;t scale enough PVC&#39;s to support our rapidly expanding Data Center network. Before we threw it out we had to cut the domain in half to support a Trading Floor (big flow pain). Gen1 6500&#39;s saved the day. OFN/SDN looks interesting but as you stated it will take years before we see the stability needed for mid-range (Enterprise) DC&#39;s. By then I suspect Cisco will have an evolved flavor with pertinent technologies that are tested in future versions the CCIE lab. Personally I love the OFN/SDN concepts, but I&#39;m staying on track for getting my (not as relevant as before) CCIE.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">There was a time when I wanted to get a CCIE. Eventually one gets to a point where experience trumps certificates. Just having a CCIE is no guarantee that Facebook or Google will hire you. I&#39;m sure they have interviewed CCIEs and then rejected them for even a junior engineer position.<br /><br />If you are new to the field, a CCIE it is a nice challenge to shoot for, but even better is to get a job in the field. IMHO, don&#39;t waste time at home alone in a lab preparing for a CCIE if you have zero job experience. Once you have that base level of knowledge that gets you in the door at a job that gets you near a router, go for it.<br /><br />I started out as the tech guy at a pair of private high schools. I had to teach secretaries how to do mail merges. I had to manage exchange servers. I also got to manage their 2501 router and Cat 5K/RSM &quot;core&quot; router. I was lucky to find a great mentor who inspired me. I&#39;ve interviewed way to many people with a CCIE who haven&#39;t worked in the field.<br /><br />Openflow and all the other wizbang new networking technologies are not going to take of the world tomorrow. There are way too many devices out there running ospf and bgp to even consider saying that the skills you need to pass the CCIE won&#39;t stay relevant. I love our field. We have awesomely interesting problems to solve. If you bring that hunger for knowledge and a proven ability to dive deep into core protocols (including TCP/IP), Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc will find you.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Do not worry about reconsidering your certification goals, if you are on your track for CCIE stick to it. People say it&#39;s just a beginning of very long learning. And judging from Ivan&#39;s words I&#39;d say technologies revolve rather than evolve, 12 years from SDN successfully conquering whole world someone may come with wonderful idea of standalone fully-intelligent box that would operate on it&#39;s own and communicate with other similarly intelligent boxes using some arcane protocols ...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Always easy to say, bah I don&#39;t need it. Perseverance to continue challenging ones self in our industry is vital, especially as the life cycles of technology shorten and the need to re-invent increases. As Ivan has pointed out many times over, technology is cyclic. Ex. IPX is a dead technology but the understanding of how dead protocols work still add value. IPv(X) keeps it relevant whether delivered via legacy protocols or decoupled control planes.<br /><br />Second we stop learning is the second we become irrelevant. Proof of discipline and goals accomplishment. I hope to knuckle down someday and work on a PHD, not necessarily for the relevancy to network architecture but the process of learning and achieving goals. Or I just need a hobby outside of work. More credentials never hurt especially when economies decrease.<br /><br />A primary value prop IMO of SDN in general is lowering OPeX. Technology fundamentally is to do more with less. There will always be a need for high level engineers/architect/developers regardless of the technology. Integrating basic understandings business is becoming just as vital as tech IQ. Our intellect is our currency. Cisco may fade at some point (partnership value lowered), but the age old debate over vendor certs is anything that still has integrity and a vicious lab should hold value (I think :)<br /><br />Hell, like Marc pointed out, go look at Monster.

            <div class="comment-content">Yep, lots of good stuff in there. &quot;Second we stop learning is the second we become irrelevant.&quot;<br /><br />Self-directed learning is one of the key skills I look for in interviews. Particularly between phone screens and in person interviews. If you missed a question in a screen and didn&#39;t spend some time figuring it out before an in-house... you&#39;d better be a rockstar.<br /><br />What bugs me about CCIE is afaik, it requires learning EIGRP. I&#39;m sorry, I am not going to spend time learning EIGRP. I don&#39;t ever want to work on a network that uses it. I&#39;m sure it is a fine protocol and Cisco gives it a lot of love. It just isn&#39;t for me.<br /><br />Cheers!</div>

            <div class="comment-content">But in a MPLS environment if your customer doesn&#39;t want BGP, EIGRP will be much better than OSPF because you don&#39;t need to run another process for every customers. Also it&#39;s super easy if you have a backdoor link because EIGRP metric will be encoded into BGP and you simple increase the backdoor link&#39;s metric and the job is done.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan, Thanks a lot for your answer. Actually I was who put you this question. After reading your post and all the comments I have made my decision, I going to stick for the CCIE challenge, hopefully for summer it will be done ;). Of course, because the future is on virtualization, I will be aware of all novelties on that field. Greetings from Spain (and sorry for my English, it should be improved for sure).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I don&#39;t think the CCIE is that relevant today but the status it gets is still warranted. Its hard. It requires focus, dedication and a huge commitment. Not to mention the ability to stay calm and do complex stuff for 8 hours under lots of pressure. <br /><br />All of the above are excellent skills for any engineer, regardless of what they are working on.<br /><br />Most CCIE&#39;s will happily admit they forgot how to configure feature X that was on the blueprint 5 years ago. However throw a book at them, ask them to learn something new for that important customer meeting next week, and more often than not they will deliver.<br /><br />My 2p.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I did read the argument &quot;CCIE no longer relevant or worthed&quot; written by a known author back in 2002. Somehow I followed that advice and that just delayed by career for few years. Thanks God years I became older, more mature and I realized that people writing may be as a smart or - dumb - as anyone else. As long as the CCIE program remains serious as is, yes it is relevant.<br /><br />I pursued and achieved the CCIE R&amp;S and I am very happy with it. Yes, experience of course is key, but one has to realize that often the credentials will open the doors to let you take more experience. As far as relevance goes, I can see cloud computing, initially as a hybrid model then years later as a more full utility computing platform, would likely contain or even reduce the number of data centers maintained by individual corporations. That said, I can see CCIEs (which also have degrees and other attributes that make them attractive to service providers) finding more opportunities with development companies and service providers. In corporations, I believe security teams responsible to audit and validate the service provider networks have not been breached will still be needed but I imagine that business analysts could execute that task. Also, I can see database functions still needed in corporations to do SQL queries, data mining, etc.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">There is no such experience where you can do so many configuration and topology changes as you can do in labs. Nowdays experience is overestimated.Of course it is importanrt ,but what kind of experience? I know some people,they  have been working for  5 years ,but they only configure firewall rules,add vlans and static routes... Procedure in many companies will not alow you to make experiments with devices in real enviroment. Of course, you will improve what you do,but as i said in many comnpanies you don&#39;t have contact to all technologies.It depends where you work..Everything is important..I met some  people with exprience in at&amp;t wich  know how to configure smtg,but they don&#39;t understand the concept at all ...The concept  in books is not in vain,it teachs you to predict issues in real enviroment..</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;m currently pursuing CCIE RS, I wrote the CCIE DC Beta a few weeks ago, because at $50 a CCIE exam, it was worth it just to see what it is about and where they see the qualification going. It was a great eye-opener, but it was far less &quot;demanding&quot; than I thought it would be. Theory only granted, but still it was stuff I actually knew. And then I thought how did I know so much of that stuff without actually &quot;using&quot; that tech every day? Day to Day experience. <br /><br />I too, like many others here, have been in IT for over 10 years. Started out as a MCSE, then Compaq ASE, then Cisco wannabe. Been after my CCIE for 10 years. Became a PADI instructor somewhere in between. :) Back in IT now. Can honestly tell you, CCIE RS ... it is the stepping stone to everything else. Consulting, deep-dive technical, design ... the works. Whatever you are after ... it can get you there. <br /><br />The IT world is full of &quot;the-next-big&quot; thing technologies. Now more than ever. I follow a lot of technology. I spend an hour each day, at least, reading the likes of VentureBeat, SiliconValley.com, Ivan&#39;s articles, Wired, and more. Following what Apple, Google, Microsoft, all the big players are doing. New technology, where it is going, what people are doing with their time, what new applications are being developed, where mobile is heading. And it excites me more every day. The world is opening up to soooo much potential. But, I can promise you one thing .... they may all be running datacentres, and fancy virtualisation, but, and for me in Africa this is more relevant than anything else, without connectivity .... who is going to be able to use those apps? Connectivity is what makes it all happen ... and who makes the connectivity happen? The CCIE&#39;s of the world that&#39;s who. Security, SP, R&amp;S ... they&#39;re the guys making these things become reality. And how did they get there? Experience, experience, experience. CCIE RS is not going away any time soon. If anything ... it might just get a shed-load harder. <br /><br />To finish off ... who gets the opportunity to play with all the new kit first? Not typically the NA&#39;s or even the NP&#39;s. Nope, it&#39;s usually the big guys. Here, you know networking, figure this out. One of our customers wants something called a Nexus 7000! ;)</div>

Although i have been a CCNA since 2004, the urge to go for the big shot developed just six months ago.

            <div class="comment-content">Hmm sorry just have to say getting a CCIE is a great achievement but also it should be understood that often a lot of CCIE are like ducks out of water when thrown against another vendor or field even within Cisco. Being able to configure IOS does not mean that you can configure a JUNOS box of Alcatel Lucent SR OS ...sorry it doesn&#39;t it also constrains you if you just stick to only one vendors path. Nor does it make you an expert on NX OS its quirks or setting up Dial Peers Call Manager etc. etc.<br />Im not talking of being a jack of all trades but being a specialist in multiple vendors is most likely the future.<br />Problem with Cisco at the moment is an CCIE R+S does not necessarily know how to configure NX OS  vpc or otv or the MDS and FCoE systems... and forget often vendor interop...its just not there only Cisco press version of it. So Cisco portfolio grows as they aquire more companies and in fact can clash with methods. Think Meraki WiFi methods and management setup to Aironet ..now all Cisco.. <br />Go for the CCIE sure. R+S will help get aligned to a channel partner of course but does not mean they can configure and setup your VOIP (SIP or Cisco Call Manager Dial peers et all  ) and or Cisco Data Centre Environment. <br />My point is being a CCIE will not guarantee that you will be able to sort out all problems in a mixed vendor stoke vendor interop environment.<br />But often other vendors are overlooked or not understood even by Cisco CCIE when tackling issues as they only know one way...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Well, speaking as a CCIE, I can say that 1) You&#39;re pretty well spot on, but 2) Anyone going for their IE is well aware the scope xD. <br /><br />That said, there&#39;s a TON of carry over. While the syntax changes been vendors (and platforms for that matter as you pointed out with NX-OS, or IOS-XR) the concepts don&#39;t. After passing the R/S, I went to a cloud vendor who ran 0 IOS devices. All NX-OS, IOS-XR, and ASA. I had no problems adjusting.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I agree with Jon, those who pass the CCIE generally realise how much they really don&#39;t know about the field. With the dedication and skills learnt about how to study they can apply those transitioning into other technology areas. CCIE is kinda like climbing a tall mountain to only realize it blocked the view of an even bigger mountain. All things being equal would you prefer to be the person standing in front of the first mountain, or the one who conquered the first and can see the bigger picture?</div>
