      "html": "Actually, of more interest than bandwidth-on-demand is enforcing dynamic bandwidth sharing and guaranteed throughput in a policy driven way - more complex as compared to simple aggregate Diff-Serv stat-mux and flow-rate fairness.  Quite often this goal does not even require any application-side support, but rather a centralized arbiter having network topology and application deployment awareness. Granular policy enforcement could be done at the network edge (ToR&#39;s/Server Network Stack/Software switches), which results in benign growth of configuration state density. The amount of research work done in this area is tremendous (apparently a hot topic ;) - you may be already aware of the following projects (some of them come from Microsoft ;). <br /><br />http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/users/varghese/netshare.pdf<br />http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/srikanth/data/nsdi11_seawall.pdf<br />http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2011/HPL-2011-77.pdf<br />http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/arvind/papers/faircloud.pdf<br /><br />+ others - thousands of them!... ;)",
