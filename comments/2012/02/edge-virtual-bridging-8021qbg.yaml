  html: While I tend to agree, I think that EVB will be a long term winner. My current
    favourite is a VEB using TRILL to connect to the network means no LAG, no STP,
    and a proper communication of state between server and the network. <br /><br
    />The IEEE is not serving it&#39;s community very well by taking so long over
    this.

  html: It&#39;s clear VLANs don&#39;t scale for very large environments, but I&#39;d
    say for the very large majority of deployments, they scale just fine.  So maybe
    EVB will have it&#39;s place in the market.  However, if the L2oIP solutions become
    easy enough to manage longer term for the average Joe, then why not use them for
    all designs and we can be done with VLAN trunks, etc.  As always time well tell.

  html: i&#39;m getting lost with all those vm networking solutions  :-[ when i approach
    a new customer, they always want the most known-affordable-oldest solution !

  html: I would be more visionnary here but I do think that NO virtualization is the
    long term winning solution...<br />If you look at the chip vendors architectures
    evolving fast, and the application architecture increasing you will be able in
    the coming years to consolidate apps &amp; networking on a same platform without
    hypervisors. Therefore coming back to more simple software architecture.<br />Hadoop-like
    solutions?  O:-)

  html: Guest,<br />Being visionary is great and there are a lack of those folks out
    there that are...BUT...we can&#39;t do a full 180 over night throw away everything
    that&#39;s been done for 25+ yrs.  Gradual changes work best.  We&#39;ll see adoption
    of newer architectures from CSPs, large financials, hyper scale companies, and
    they will probably make their way into the Enterprise and then SMB, and into the
    home. We&#39;ll see.  That goes for everything @Cloudtoad has been talking about
    too.  It sounds great, but not realistic in the short term for the MAJORITY of
    environments out there.  Customers need validated designs that work and a support
    model that provides SLAs.

  html: '@Guest: Your vision is correct. Long-term, PaaS is the way to go ... but
    it will take as long as it took us to get from 3270+CICS to Web 2.0+iPad.<br /><br
    />@jedelman8: absolutely agree.'

  html: '@other Anon: If we were to find ourselves working back to the multiple-applications-on-one-OS/appserver
    model, it would just serve to feed my confirmation bias that everything good gets
    trounced in the market by slipshod cheap solutions, then we slowly and painfully
    work our way back to upgrading the dominant solutions to do all the things the
    better solution did in the first place, albeit with more cruft.  e.g. SCSI vs
    IDE-&gt;ATA-&gt;SATA and Firewire vs USB1-&gt;2-&gt;3.<br /><br />And we refuse
    to learn from history, so we are doomed to repeat it.<br /><br />'
