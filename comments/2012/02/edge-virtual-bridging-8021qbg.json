      "html": "While I tend to agree, I think that EVB will be a long term winner. My current favourite is a VEB using TRILL to connect to the network means no LAG, no STP, and a proper communication of state between server and the network. <br /><br />The IEEE is not serving it&#39;s community very well by taking so long over this.",

      "html": "It&#39;s clear VLANs don&#39;t scale for very large environments, but I&#39;d say for the very large majority of deployments, they scale just fine.  So maybe EVB will have it&#39;s place in the market.  However, if the L2oIP solutions become easy enough to manage longer term for the average Joe, then why not use them for all designs and we can be done with VLAN trunks, etc.  As always time well tell.",

Therefore coming back to more simple software architecture.<br />Hadoop-like solutions?  O:-)",

Gradual changes work best.  We&#39;ll see adoption of newer architectures from CSPs, large financials, hyper scale companies, and they will probably make their way into the Enterprise and then SMB, and into the home. We&#39;ll see.  That goes for everything @Cloudtoad has been talking about too.  It sounds great, but not realistic in the short term for the MAJORITY of environments out there.  Customers need validated designs that work and a support model that provides SLAs.",
