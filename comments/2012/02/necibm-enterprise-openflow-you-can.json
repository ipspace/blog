You know better than this Ivan, we measure these things n microseconds in modern networks.<br />Thanks for letting me know about solutions I can implement in 1985.",

Who is &quot;we?&quot;  While I definitely agree microseconds and even nanoseconds are used by vendors to compare speeds and feeds mainly for those in a low latency vertical like FSI or HPC, there are MANY customers and MANY applications that wouldn&#39;t care about 8-9ms.",

You don&#39;t know how lucky you&#39;ve been ... we had to deal with 64 kbps modems, routers driven by Motorola 68000 CPU, AppleTalk and the like.",
