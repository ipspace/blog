  html: I am wondering how much Nicira would impact the network appliance business
    (ADC, firewalls, security gateways, etc...)<br />Theoricallly, Nicira could trigger
    their transformation into basic silicon chip foundries :-D<br />Or give the business
    hand to new players in the data path only...<br /><br />Or is that just apply
    to router/switch?
