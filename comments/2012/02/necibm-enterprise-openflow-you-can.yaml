  html: Totally irelevant tech.  8-9 MILIseconds on first frame, and using a tool
    that only has granularity down to the ms to measure performance.  You know better
    than this Ivan, we measure these things n microseconds in modern networks.<br
    />Thanks for letting me know about solutions I can implement in 1985.

  html: 'Wow... they actually used an existing protocol in the setup:  LLDP.  That
    makes me happy.'

  html: Hi Coward, &quot;we&quot; measure in microseconds.  Who is &quot;we?&quot;  While
    I definitely agree microseconds and even nanoseconds are used by vendors to compare
    speeds and feeds mainly for those in a low latency vertical like FSI or HPC, there
    are MANY customers and MANY applications that wouldn&#39;t care about 8-9ms.

  html: I&#39;m not sure why it would matter if the delay occurs only on the first
    frame between a pair of VMs.  <br /> <br />Also, it&#39;s nice to hear you were
    able to implement such a solution in 1985. You don&#39;t know how lucky you&#39;ve
    been ... we had to deal with 64 kbps modems, routers driven by Motorola 68000
    CPU, AppleTalk and the like.
