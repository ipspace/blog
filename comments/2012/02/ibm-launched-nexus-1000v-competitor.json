The general feedback that I&#39;ve been hearing is that VMware&#39;s virtual switch has been closing the gap with Cisco and that with each upgrade of vSphere that Cisco is losing customers due to challenges with upgrades (and the solution has always on the expensive side, limiting overall adoption). It makes sense for IBM to be more active in edge-networking, we&#39;ll see if it has any impact on slowing its decline in bladeserver market share.",
