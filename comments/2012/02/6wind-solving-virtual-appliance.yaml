  html: '&gt; A VM using 6WINDGate can still communicate through vSwitch with other
    VMs or with the orchestration/management software while having high-speed communication
    with other VMs using 6WINDGate.<br /><br />What about intercepting 6W to 6W communications,
    for example, for IPS/IDS purposes?'

  html: Hi!<br />Good question!<br />Actually we have all the open &amp; standard
    APIS to integrate with whatever OSS you use for network communication troubleshooting
    or security purposes . Meanwhile, working with some of those particular layers
    to hairpin the logs.<br />Thanks!

  html: This would be much more interesting if the network connectivity of the other
    VMs was being funneled through a 6WIND virtual appliance. Otherwise, this has
    very limited usefulness.

  html: I thought so based on your comment on an earlier post. But this post seems
    to say that the 6WIND stack should be directly installed into each VM. Not that
    it&#39;s all that clear either way, but having a very strong virtualization background,
    I&#39;m reading into it to try to figure out the details and a good portion of
    the wording had me leaning towards it being installed into every VM. That would
    make it very limiting considering the dependency on physical NICs, as well as
    how that would break VM mobility.<br /><br />Anyway, if VM traffic is being funneled
    through a 6WIND virtual appliance of sorts, then this gets interesting. I imagine
    such an appliance would need to run on every host, sort of like an extension of
    the virtual switch. I&#39;m seen that setup before where each host has multiple
    vSwiches, one with physical uplinks and the appliance, and the other with the
    appliance (providing switching/routing capabilities) and the production VMs. <br
    /><br />Does this setup interfere with support for features such as vMotion/live
    migration?

  html: The way I understood David, you have to install 6WIND stack into each VM (was
    it not clear from the article?)<br /><br />Obviously having direct connectivity
    between VM and physical HW (NIC) breaks VM mobility.<br /><br />A 6WIND appliance
    would be a cool idea, but would still require a 6WIND stack in the &quot;fast
    path&quot; VMs. A decent stack in the hypervisor would be the right solutions
    ;)

  html: 'To ensure we are clear here: you need our stack only for high performance
    purposes (virtual appliance such as firewall, adc, gateways...). We still keep
    the communication with other VMs with no 6WINDGate (with e1000, VMXNet3,...)<br
    />There are 2 concerns with SW appliances run over virtualization: <br />- guest
    OS kernel over multicore does not scale linearly.<br />- hypervisor kernel brings
    performance penalties as well.<br /><br />We bring performance improvments there.
    Obviously vMotion is maybe more difficult to implement but the question is do
    you need virtual appliance vmotioned when those VA could (and should) be HA implemented?'

  html: 'Illustration: <br />An use case with 15VMs protected by a virtual firewall
    on a host would require only one 6WINDgate stack on this vFirewall VA, that&#39;s
    all. We do not touch to the other VMs.  :)<br />Hope it is more clear!'
