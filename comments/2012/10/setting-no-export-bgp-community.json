In that case, if we set the community no-export in the route-map that we are going to apply outbound towards the neighbor, this will have no effect in the default route because it does not pass by Adj-Rib-Out ( http://blog.ioshints.info/2007/11/bgp-default-route.html ).<br /><br />The solution would be to set the community in the route-map applied after the default-originate command: neighbor default-originate route-map NO-EXPORT.<br /><br />By the way, there is no need to do a soft/hard reset after applying this route-map as it does not pass through BGP output filters.<br /><br />Jose.
