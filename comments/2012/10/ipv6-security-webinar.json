      "html": "honestly the recent security breakages and the whole NSA thing teaches us one thing. Most security are like tank obstacles in war, they hold off attackers only for a period of time. The best security is the fear of criminal punishment. The more realistic is the dread of getting caught for trying to code inject someone&#39;s shoestore website, less the chance of some kid trying out what he learned in his security class in college.<br />Political attacks are obviously more motivated, but recreational attackers would be greatly deterred. <br />That&#39;s why you don&#39;t see lot of graffiti in NY anymore. They know that if the cops see them jumping over fences to spraypaint someone&#39;s gate, they&#39;ll get a maple syrup enema.",
