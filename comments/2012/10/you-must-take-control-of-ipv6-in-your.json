      "html": "Excellent post. If you do not take control over IPv6 it will take control over you!<br />You already mentioned the Healthy Paranoia security podcast, which is great. The latest, IPv6 Security Smackdown, has some great tools and resources in the shownotes. The NIST SP800-119 guidelines needs a special mention. <br />To get started with implementing IPv6 in your network and get to know IPv6 in general I can endorse this document by the Dutch SURF-net...<br />http://www.surfnet.nl/Documents/handleiding_201012_IPv6_nummerplan_EN.pdf",

      "html": "Great post Ivan.  I agree that we should monitor and control all IPv6 traffic.  However, I would strongly caution against outright disabling all IPv6 on a system.  On your Windows systems for example, Microsoft does not support disabling IPv6:<br />Per the Microsoft IPv6 FAQ (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/network/cc987595.aspx), \u201cFrom Microsoft&#39;s perspective, IPv6 is a mandatory part of the Windows operating system and it is enabled and included in standard Windows service and application testing during the operating system development process. Because Windows was designed specifically with IPv6 present, Microsoft does not perform any testing to determine the effects of disabling IPv6. If IPv6 is disabled on Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, or Windows Server 2008, or later versions, some components will not function. Moreover, applications that you might not think are using IPv6\u2014such as Remote Assistance, HomeGroup, DirectAccess, and Windows Mail\u2014could be.\u201d",
