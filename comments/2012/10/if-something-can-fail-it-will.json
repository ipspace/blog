Two inside routers, two outside, two VPNs, redundant A/B power on generator backup,...the works.  The individual circuits (DS-3s) even terminated on each outer router, used separate fiber media converters, and left the building via discrete entrances on opposite sides of the building.<br /><br />The fiber circled the campus, eventually coming together on the other side of the campus to the telco demarc,  Inside the telco demarc, the fiber came in, plugged into two separate fiber media converters to transition it back to a regular DS-3.<br /><br />Both media converters were sitting on a shelf in the telco room, plugged into a single household surge suppressor/power strip which was in turn plugged into a wall outlet.",

      "html": "Another story involving diesel generators...<br /><br />About 12-13 years ago, I was working for a large telco in the UK (not BT), and one hot summer&#39;s day (yes, it was a rare hot summer&#39;s day!) I was doing some work in one of our major data centers, and when I arrived early in the morning, the data center was taking delivery of a large container.<br /><br />When I asked what it was about, they said it contained a generator that was going to provide some extra power being as the cooling systems had been working on max, and so the existing power was straining somewhat.  I thought to myself &quot;cool&quot; (pun intended) and went inside to start my work for the day.<br /><br />Later that morning, the fire alarms went off, and suddenly the who DC shut down with only emergency lighting.  When I got outside, I found out what had happened: the new container generator had been connected near one of the air intakes for the DC cooling system, and when they fired the generator up, the resulting rather large diesel cloud promptly got sucked into the DC air intakes, at which point the smoke detectors inside the building decided there was a fire and shut everything down.<br /><br />When I arrived the next day to carry on with my work, they&#39;d installed a fat pipe from the generator exhaust which carried the fumes significantly far away from the DC building itself.<br /><br />There was plenty of redundancy in that DC, but none of it helped that particular day.  :-)",

There were 2 OC3s feeding connectivity, from one last mile provider, but two dfferent redundant paths etc. We had beautiful implementation plans, all laid to very detail, and when the time came I shut ports, equipment was powered down and carried to different building by local staff. Technician was ready to pull the fiber, telco was given green  signal and their dispatched field engineer physically cut fiber at ODF nearby. Except ... Somebody somewhere some long time ago when it was originally delivered put incorrect tags on circuits and they had their IDs swapped.

If I remember correctly the sequence of events went something like this...<br /><br />The link ran on diverse paths - one following the coast line and another going via an inland path. At around 3am the line card that terminated the coastal link had started to show errors and then failed. No problem all traffic routed across the inland path. Engineers were notified to go onsite at 9am to replace the faulty card... except that at around 6 or 7am, a backhoe went through the inland path. Next biggest problem was that many providers were reselling services across these links as well.<br /><br /><br />Now maybe the order was the other way around, but since then the title of this blog post has been my #1 Design Stipulation",
