If you&#39;re protecting all VMs, and you have a high-end server with tens of VMs, it might make sense to have a per-server firewall VM. If you&#39;re protecting only a few VMs per server, less so.<br /><br />Another question is the manageability of VM-per-server solution versus a somewhat more centralized firewall VM.<br /><br />Finally, there&#39;s no integration with vCloud Director. vCD doesn&#39;t support any of the NIC-level firewalls (including vShield App).",

      "html": "Ivan,<br /><br />In your sample webinar&#39;s dialog, you state that a vGW solution does not scale in multi-tenant solutions, stating a need for one firewall per tenant per host. Not exactly true.<br /><br />vGW can be deployed in a multi-tenant solution, with the following limitations:<br /><br />*No built-in separation of logging for tenants<br />*No RBAC in the management interface<br />*Common IDS Policy<br /><br />The above two limitations can be either worked around with a front-end system that separates logging and allows a RBAC&#39;d interface to vGW with the decently robust API. Not ideal, but certainly an option avoiding the tenancy problem.<br /><br />vGW 5.5, released weeks ago, states you can &quot;split&quot; the interface to service multi-tenancy customers, but I have not tested this yet.",

      "html": "Thanks for this. Very interesting. One question though, maybe I misunderstood (I hope). In the video you were saying that with solutions like Juniper&#39;s vGW you need one virtual firewall per virtual machine you want to protect. 20 VMs on one Host = 20 virtual firewalls on the same host. Huh? You sure about that?",
