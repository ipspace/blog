  html: Thanks for this. My setup is (WWW)-(ASA)-880wifi. I had similar issue and
    took a different approach by subnetting wifi devices different from wired (seems
    like problem comes with proliferation of all the new wifi gadgets). I then just
    NAT overload all wifi through one of the wired IP addresses. A little crude but
    works, nonetheless.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Marc

  html: Pity it is not my solution... Netscreen 50 can&#39;t assign more that 255
    IP in total, in it&#39;s DHCP Pools... :(<br />I can&#39;t find a way to do that...
