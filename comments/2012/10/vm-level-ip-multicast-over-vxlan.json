          "html": "Mike,<br />The problem is that, as far as my understanding is, the physical switches have no visibility into the underlying VXLAN encapsulation. It&#39;s a MAC-in-IP scheme. The &quot;certain endpoints&quot; are in their own VXLAN-encap&#39;d VLAN, which is then encapsulated in plain old IP. The physical switches only ever seen IP traffic and just forward/route it to whichever VM host the traffic is going to. Thus no IGMP snooping can happen at the physical network and needs to happen in the virtual switches that have visibility to the VM&#39;s virtualized ports. It&#39;s essentially MAC-in-IP-over-Ethernet/L2 <br /><br />This is just my basic understanding, from Ivan&#39;s blog and Packet Pushers (Show 66). I&#39;m sure Ivan (and others) can shed some additional details on this.",
