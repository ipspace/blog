  html: Excellent post. If you do not take control over IPv6 it will take control
    over you!<br />You already mentioned the Healthy Paranoia security podcast, which
    is great. The latest, IPv6 Security Smackdown, has some great tools and resources
    in the shownotes. The NIST SP800-119 guidelines needs a special mention. <br />To
    get started with implementing IPv6 in your network and get to know IPv6 in general
    I can endorse this document by the Dutch SURF-net...<br />http://www.surfnet.nl/Documents/handleiding_201012_IPv6_nummerplan_EN.pdf

  html: Very good article; people really do need to stop ignoring ipv6 and start using
    it.  By the way, another workaround to the rogue RA problem (at least in a server
    network context) would be to disable autoconf (rather than disabling all v6).

  html: "Great post Ivan.  I agree that we should monitor and control all IPv6 traffic.\
    \  However, I would strongly caution against outright disabling all IPv6 on a\
    \ system.  On your Windows systems for example, Microsoft does not support disabling\
    \ IPv6:<br />Per the Microsoft IPv6 FAQ (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/network/cc987595.aspx),\
    \ \u201CFrom Microsoft&#39;s perspective, IPv6 is a mandatory part of the Windows\
    \ operating system and it is enabled and included in standard Windows service\
    \ and application testing during the operating system development process. Because\
    \ Windows was designed specifically with IPv6 present, Microsoft does not perform\
    \ any testing to determine the effects of disabling IPv6. If IPv6 is disabled\
    \ on Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, or Windows Server 2008,\
    \ or later versions, some components will not function. Moreover, applications\
    \ that you might not think are using IPv6\u2014such as Remote Assistance, HomeGroup,\
    \ DirectAccess, and Windows Mail\u2014could be.\u201D"

  html: 'Need an example:<br /><br />Vanilla install of Exchange with services dispatched
    on a number of servers.<br />By default and without any IPv6 configuration, the
    incoming/outgoing mail path contains an IPv6 hop between two of the nodes that
    share a common subnet, using fe80:: local IPs.<br /><br />You might not do IPv6,
    but you&#39;re advertising differently in your mail headers....'
