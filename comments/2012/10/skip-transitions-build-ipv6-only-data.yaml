  html: yes, I agree with this philosophy. if you lucky enough to start a DC from
    scratch, then some brain cycle should be taken for IPv6 feasibility. Make sure
    to review all product needed in that DC to fit IPv6 right away.

    html: Poorly ... thus many of them will be busy transitioning for the next 10

    html: At least you could place new servers into IPv6-only VLANs and have dual-stack
      on clients only.... but only if they don&#39;t have dependencies with legacy
      IPv4-only servers...
