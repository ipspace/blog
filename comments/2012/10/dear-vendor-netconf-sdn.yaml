    html: Carl, I agree with you that blaming NETCONF for the stupidities vendors
      do is the same as blaming HTTP for broken web sites. It would be fair to the
      NETCONF protocol to rephrase the heading into &quot;XML-encoded CLI using a
      well-defined namespace and delivered over SSH with a few extra characters !=
      SDN&quot;, but then nobody would read it ;)<br /><br />However, based on how
      undefined SDN is, and how malleable to type-casting it is, it&#39;s probably
      comparable to anything, so my comparison is valid ;)<br /><br />The fact of
      life is (although both of us know better) that most people see NETCONF as &quot;configuration
      management tool&quot;. All implementations I&#39;ve seen so far use NETCONF
      as CLI replacement, and even the new drafts appearing in NETMOD working group
      focus on configuration aspects.<br /><br />While there&#39;s nothing that would
      stop NETCONF+YANG (or SOAP+XML+XSLT or REST+JSON or BGP+new-AF+communities or
      ...) from becoming a universal transport protocol, that&#39;s not how it&#39;s
      used today, and that&#39;s not what the SDNwashing marketing people are trying
      to sell us.<br /><br />As for the &quot;what can be done with NETCONF&quot;
      - I had a fully automated web-based customer provisioning system in 1993, and
      it included core router and access server configuration, so I know pretty well
      what CAN be done if someone decides to do it. Our FlipIT service is another
      good example - it auto-provisions everything from customer VMs to firewalls
      and Cisco Call Manager.<br /><br />However, yet again, even in those cases NETCONF
      is just a slightly more reliable transport protocol until the vendors actually
      implement things that are in NETMOD drafts 10 years after the NETCONF group
      was formed. I would call that glacial progress, but maybe I&#39;m still young
      and restless.

  html: 'After sitting on my hands for a day I still can&#39;t resist the urge to
    bite :-) So, here are some reflections from the vantage point of a vendor to $vendors.<br
    /><br />First of all, the layering violation in the &quot;NETCONF != SDN&quot;
    phrase is... challenging. No, NETCONF envelopes around current CLIs (*cough*cisco*cough*)
    does not result in SDNishness. But that is, frankly, a little unfair to the protocol
    (NETCONF) and the modelling language (YANG). See, it would be trivial (but utterly
    pointless) to reimplement the OpenFlow protocol in NETCONF and YANG. Would such
    an exercise result in &quot;NETCONF == SDN&quot;?<br /><br />Perhaps another interesting
    approach to this is to look at the canonical uses cases that are proposed in SDNland.
    The recurring pattern is that they require access to features below (in terms
    of abstraction) what&#39;s exposed through SNMP and CLI in traditional systems.
    There is nothing in the protocol itself, of course, that stops $vendor development
    teams to expose lower-level APIs through it. It&#39;s more a side-effect of what
    (almost) all router and switch vendor software architectures look like. <br /><br
    />We&#39;re starting to see service provider teams and software developers warming
    up the potential power of this &quot;reliable Expect script&quot; (I&#39;ll let
    that rest for another blog post comment ;-) and are doing quite interesting things
    with it. As an example, there&#39;s a presentation on &quot;Network Configuration
    Management and Service Activation&quot; from NORDUnet available here (seems like
    the sound is gone for the first 5 mins): http://bit.ly/Vo2YMo No, this might not
    make it formally achieve SDNification, but it&#39;s an example of using software
    to program a NETCONF-enabled network.'

  html: Well, does Nicira provide SDN? Because all they do with OpenFlow is to configure
    GRE tunnels, which might as well had been done with NETCONF. I mean, SDN is defined
    by seperating control from data, which can be done without using OpenFlow, but
    with just programing vendor-specific CLIs. Of course this can be a pain to implement
    and does not allow for programming forwarding tables and the potential that comes
    with it, but wouldn&#39;t you call it SDN?
