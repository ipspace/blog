  html: "Yes, it\xB4s sad, on many (edge) switches, &quot;ND snooping&quot; features\
    \ are easily bypassed by THC, blocking fragmented IPv6 packets inbound is not\
    \ possible, e.g. HP:<br /><br />http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/Comware-Based/Securing-IPv6-on-A-series-Comware-5-2/td-p/2380573<br\

    \ Extreme,...?<br /><br /><br />Apropos IPv6 security, this might be interesting\

  html: honestly the recent security breakages and the whole NSA thing teaches us
    one thing. Most security are like tank obstacles in war, they hold off attackers
    only for a period of time. The best security is the fear of criminal punishment.
    The more realistic is the dread of getting caught for trying to code inject someone&#39;s
    shoestore website, less the chance of some kid trying out what he learned in his
    security class in college.<br />Political attacks are obviously more motivated,
    but recreational attackers would be greatly deterred. <br />That&#39;s why you
    don&#39;t see lot of graffiti in NY anymore. They know that if the cops see them
    jumping over fences to spraypaint someone&#39;s gate, they&#39;ll get a maple
    syrup enema.
