When you get right down to it, a large number of &quot;sysadmins&quot; (particularly those in my customer base who are part of a small team and thus have to be multi-skilled) actually don&#39;t understand how IPv4, NAT, DHCP or other technologies really work. They&#39;ve been used to putting certain numbers in certain boxes because that&#39;s how they&#39;ve always been taught to do it and that&#39;s what makes it work(ish). Indeed, many of these people have been taught badly.<br /><br />So, when you try and add a new varient on a technology they don&#39;t have a fundamental knowledge that they can fall back on - rather it&#39;s a paralysing fear of a thing that they just don&#39;t understand. Not letting go of what they know is not letting go of the security blanket of a set of habits that they call &quot;the way it&#39;s done&quot;.",

      "html": "Hey!  First off, thanks for taking the time to read my article.  Secondly, if I may, I&#39;d like to take the time to offer a few counter points and clarifications.  (No, I am not out to start a flame war.)<br /><br />Regarding the lack of consumer/SME gear, I never intended to indicate that none existed at all.  Certainly some does; even Dlink is starting to ship some gear that is (for the most part) IPv6 capable.  The issue is one of quality and usability.  &quot;Will pass IPv6 packets&quot; is a heck of a lot different than &quot;gives you a single point of management for your whole network.&quot;  (As current IPv4 cheap-o CPE stuff does.)<br /><br />IPv6 consumer gear largely expects everything will autoconfigure, won&#39;t need to worry about things like renumbering, and generally are just dumb consumer devices that do nothing but consume content.  It expects individual devices to manage their own firewalls and thus offer really terrible ACL/firewall support.  (Thus Johnny Cyberphreak can crawl down your tubes and pwn your toaster with relative ease.)<br /><br />Again; the statement in my article was never intended to say that no gear existed at all, but simply that it is both exceptionally rare and most of what exists borders on unfit for the described purpose.<br /><br />The &quot;no more static addresses thing&quot; was NOT a reference to an inability to statically address a given system in IPv6.  It was instead a reference to the inability to reasonably and reliably static address these systems in an environment where renumbering was going to take place.<br /><br />Autorenumbering tech?  Not until you have a completely bulletproof implementation of all relevant technologies in a single widget for a sub-$100 price with a dead-simple interface<br /><br />As to DHCP/DNS/etc &quot;just working,&quot; we&#39;re going to have to agree to disagree.  I have seen all sorts of things that can break these setups.  It&#39;s more common than we&#39;d like to think.<br /><br />\u201cNAT is the solution.\u201d  Hell no.  NAT is a terrible, kludge.  I personally do not believe NAT (or NPT66) is the right solution to the problems I listed.  I do however think that it is the solution that works right now, today.  Unfortunately for us all, that is all that will *ever* matter to SMEs.<br /><br />Potential solutions, solutions that are more expensive than current ones, solutions that don&#39;t deliver immediate and obvious value, or solutions that require things like &quot;trusting your ISPs to play ball and not be douchenozzles&quot; will simply never fly.<br /><br />Part 2 to follow\u2026",

      "html": "In the end, the purpose of my article was to highlight the fact that the purity of the technical solution *doesn&#39;t matter* to the average Joe.  You know how to properly implement an IPv6 network.  I know how to properly implement an IPv6 network.  We both know enough to build this stuff out of duct tape and glue if we have to.<br /><br />But that&#39;s irrelevant.  What matters is *simple* and *cheap*.  NAT solves the problems (real or imagined) that SMEs and consumers see when they look at IPv6.  If we want to prevent NAT from gaining any sort of hold, then we have to put our hubris aside, accept that IPv6&#39;s marketing, message and CPE implementations were an [expletive deleted] hatchet job, and focus on the money, not the technical purity considerations.<br /><br />You aren&#39;t dealing with a base of &quot;sysadmins&quot; who know what an IPv4 header looks like and can tell you what the community string of an SNMP packet is by slapping wireshark on a line.  Instead, you have \u201csysadmin-as-a-second-jobbers\u201d who know only that they need to run a mailserver and a webserver and a what-have-you, on the cheap. They need to do it from the consumer-grade DSL connection they can afford and they need to do it with the shoestring equipment they can find at the local Best Buy.<br /><br />The disconnect between this world and the world inhabited by IPv6ers needs highlighting, the gap needs bridging.  And the current culture of \u201cscorn and belittle people into complying\u201d will achieve the opposite results from those desired.<br /><br />I felt it was worth clarifying that, and sorry for the longwindedness of my post.<br /><br />I am planning a follow-up article probably towards the end of next month.  If you would like to work with me to present a &quot;IPv6-with-no-compromises for environments where the word &quot;Cisco&quot; means &quot;too much money&quot;&quot; style article I will entirely welcome the collaboration.<br /><br />I have written the article to get the IPv6ers riled up and thinking about the problem.  At some point I hope that enough of the right people get angry enough about it that I can write about real world solutions to these problems that fit in the real-world price points and usability requirements of the target audience I was discussing in my article.<br /><br />The ability to say \u201chere is how you do IPv6 right, for dirt cheap, never have to worry about renumbering, its a completely bulletproof solution, can do multihoming and it is as easy as using a pfsense firewall with NPT66\u201d would be a wonderful followup.<br /><br />In the meantime, I hope my article has caused some people to think about the problems faced by those living on the frugal edge.  Maybe they will even look to addressing them.",

          "html": "NAT by itself is a decent concept. However, it was even a more stupid idea to implement NAT back then as a way to deal with IPv4 exhaustion. Because it would have been much easier to implement a protocol with a bigger address space when the Internet was small and simple. <br />   And the big elephant in the room is that they <b>didn&#39;t NEED NAT back then</b>. With CIDR we had enough IP addresses for every Internet host until the early 2000s. We actually don&#39;t need NAT now. There are only about 1.5 billion hosts on the Internet. If the addresses were not hoarded by corporation like HP or IBM, every home user could have a public IP address on their PC. <br />Instead of using NAT, they (back in the 90s) could have migrated to IPv6 as early as possible, because waiting is a truly stupid strategy. The more you delay doing your homework, they harder it would be when you actually have to do it.",
