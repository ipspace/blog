As part of acceptance testing I always encourage tests that focus on how a switch deals with very high CPU utilization, by running switches in the test network at 90%+ CPU utilization and ensuring the control plane integrity (e.g. no neighbors are dropped, STP is stable, MLAG/vPC peers remain active, etc...). This is a challenge of a converged control plane many vendors are pushing while it does give you fewer switches to manage it also has the ability to take out more switch ports, as well as drive higher CPU utilization on the switch...",

      "html": "&quot;I have to mention that these access ports are configured with Root, BDPU guard as well as Portfast.&quot;<br /><br />Wrong. Well, it depends I guess if he configured portfast on port or globally. If configured on port then the port will always be in portfast mode but if configured globally then the port would revert out of its portfast mode if a BPDU is received. Another common mistake is to use both bpdu filter and root/bpdu guard on a port. The filter will take precedence and the guards will never be used.<br /><br />Brads solution is of course the best but maybe not always an option.<br /><br />Storm control and port-security should also be configured if possible. <br /><br />The ARP situation you mention is very interesting, I&#39;ve seen this before, one single packet can wreak havoc.<br /><br />Another interesting situation can occur when customer creates loop. Say that you have customers connecting to a l2 network via some triple play box and they accidentally create a loop locally. Even if your backbone is protected from the backbones perspective this is not really a loop. It&#39;s just a lot of traffic coming from the customer which could be ARP or other traffic and this is very difficult to protect against unless you own the CPE or at least configure it.",

However, if that port receives a BPDU, the port loses it&#39;s portfast state, disables BPDUfilter and becomes a normal STP port. If you enable bpdu filter on a switchport directly, then that disables STP on that port -- ie. wont send BPDUs and it will ignore inbound BPDUs.",
