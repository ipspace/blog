  html: But, it doesn&#39;t make sense to use all of the Bandwidth in this design...
    maybe if you link D to E... no?

  html: We could try to improve this design, but that was not the point of the post.
    What really matters is that you should consider all the implications of your design,
    not just wire the switches willy-nilly and hope for the best.

  html: But the &quot;traditional&quot; 2 or 3 layer design of Access Layer switch
    connected to two Distribution Layer switches connected to X Core switches (just
    like from Cisco&#39;s SWITCH books I read now :) ) will definitely benefit from
    STP absence, too. Question is whether you need new devices to replace existing,
    when will your next HW upgrade cycle be, and if these technologies currently sold
    as big boys&#39; datacenter toys, how long it will take till they appear in mid
    and smaller market stuff.<br /><br />Or, obviously, you can stick to Routing to
    Access Layer, but then you won&#39;t have big layer2 domains...

  html: 'You&#39;re on a good path - you need some __structure__ in the DC design.
    It obviously should:<br /><br />* make sense<br />* be as simple as possible<br
    />* match your needs/goals (example: equal-cost load balancing or optimum bandwidth
    utilization or equidistant endpoints or something else).<br /><br />Unfortunately,
    this simple fact is oft ignored.'

  html: At least with routing it is well known how to modify metrics to influence
    traffic down certain paths and maybe you do in fact want unequal cost paths.  With
    L2, it is truly ECMP with shortest &quot;hops&quot; winning, right?  And is it
    possible to modify metrics or do you need to get into isis for that?<br /><br
    />Are we at the RIP stages of L2MP?

  html: BTW, I was partially being sarcastic.  And as for ISIS, it&#39;s not possible
    to manipulate, and if it was, would that ruin the simplicity of FP being plug
    in play!!!  =-O

  html: 'I do not think anybody clueful was expecting something besides shortest-path
    routing from TRILL. And not shortest path in terms of hops, either, but rather
    shortest path using interface bandwidth as a metric (which I believe TRILL does).<br
    /><br />That said though, what is the topology of choice? Obviosuly, a Clos network
    will have the minimal number of hops but the highest cost in terms of inter-switch
    links. 2/3/4 dimension Torus or hyper-cubes may also work well (you trade having
    fewer long links between switches for more hops, but still get massive bisection
    bandwidth at lower cost). Both of these topologies are widely used in the HPC
    space.<br /><br />What won&#39;t work with TRILL right now are fancy-pants topologies
    like Dragonfly, Flattenend Butterfly, etc. that require adaptive or non-minimal
    routing. But those don&#39;t work with any other mainstream routing protocol either.
    Maybe someday.<br /><br />It seems as though fabric vendors are just assuming
    a 2/3 stage Clos network is going to be the design of choice, cost be damned.<br
    /><br />One question though: What the hell is the difference between a two-stage
    Clos network and a &quot;leaf and spine&quot; network? Is it just marketing language?'

  html: In fact, there is one commonly used adaptive &quot;routing&quot; algorithm
    known as MPLS-TE ;) The problem is that it&#39;s not adaptive enough to work with
    rapidly changing traffic matrix in a data-center...<br /><br />Also, not sure
    if you can just go with shortest-path routing on a hypercube/torus either - you
    still need some sort of adaptive routing variant, or just plain old VLB (halving
    throughput in sacrifice).<br /><br />As for the cost factor, it does matter in
    smaller deployments - large scale data-centers are not really sensitive to network
    cost, as its just on the order of magnitude less compared to server costs, hence
    the preference for Clos. <br /><br />The &quot;irregular&quot; topologies are
    still interesting for small-to-med networks, though the requirement of adaptive
    routing makes it tough to implement in commodity hardware/software, and calls
    for &quot;naturally load-balanced&quot; Clos once again...

    to design it.   ;)

  html: Essentially this is correct, but when does the other link get used is when
    you have pinning technology been used with either UCS or Nexus in the picture
