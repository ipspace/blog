  html: 'Hello Ivan,<br /><br />You are raising some good points there about the challenges
    of setting<br />up high availability clusters across network boundaries. Before
    I<br />comment on them, please note that lately we have started to blog about<br
    />some of our customers&#39; applications and use cases. We are always<br />interested
    - sometimes even surprised - about the many different ways in<br />which people
    use vCider. Occasionally we just want to share a few of<br />those things on our
    blog.<br /><br />Of course, that doesn&#39;t mean that vCider is limited to just
    those<br />particular applications. For example, for many of our customers it
    is<br />not even so much about L2 connectivity, but about the ability to manage<br
    />IP address space, replicate entire network topologies and of course<br />about
    security, which for many of them is one of our main features.<br /><br />So, if
    you are asking about the &#39;nail&#39;, which the &#39;vCider hammer&#39; is<br
    />looking for: You may be able to find other tools for all the different<br />nails
    you encounter, but our users find that vCider is a pretty good<br />hammer for
    many of the nails they need to deal with. Not just a single<br />nail.<br /><br
    />When I wrote this particular blog about the IP address failover, I<br />thought
    I&#39;d combine it with the example of the gateway to connect a<br />virtual network
    to the enterprise. Big mistake! Many people were thrown<br />off by that, since
    it ends up just distracting from the main point. And<br />you are right: In that
    particular example I described, a load balancer<br />would probably be the easier
    solution.<br /><br />In hindsight now, to demonstrate the utility of IP address
    failover, I<br />think a much better example would have been the case where a
    larger<br />portion of the customer&#39;s network is in the cloud, some servers
    and also<br />some clients. If all of them are connected on a vCider network,
    then you<br />don&#39;t need to force traffic (from all clients to all servers)
    through a<br />load balancer somewhere (bottleneck, single point of failure, funny<br
    />shaped &quot;traffic trombones&quot;, etc.). Instead, all clients instantly
    now<br />are informed about a server failover. That&#39;s exactly what Linux-HA
    can<br />do so well with a gratuitous ARP. With vCider you can now use this well<br
    />established solution even in your cloud networks.'

  html: Thank you for the comment. Yet again, it seems we&#39;re in perfect agreement
    ... and as you wrote - if you would have used an example where you use vCider
    to build a typical enterprise HA app stack at Amazon or Rackspace, it would make
    perfect sense (not the enterprise HA stack, but the use of vCider to implement
    it).
