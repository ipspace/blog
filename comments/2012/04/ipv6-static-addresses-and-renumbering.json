I do sort-of buy the &quot;the apps will work better when all hosts cat talk to each other directly&quot;; however when it comes to choosing between the convenience of being able to run crappily designed protocols/apps and providing a however basic level of isolation from the raw Internet without additional effort, I choose the second without batting an eyelid.",

Nothing you can do to change it. <br /><br />You might make it more anycast-ish with LISP (and lose some of the fast failure detection and dynamic balancing capabilities), but the problem is that it would work well only if you have enough ITRs.",
