Question is whether you need new devices to replace existing, when will your next HW upgrade cycle be, and if these technologies currently sold as big boys&#39; datacenter toys, how long it will take till they appear in mid and smaller market stuff.<br /><br />Or, obviously, you can stick to Routing to Access Layer, but then you won&#39;t have big layer2 domains...",

      "html": "I do not think anybody clueful was expecting something besides shortest-path routing from TRILL. And not shortest path in terms of hops, either, but rather shortest path using interface bandwidth as a metric (which I believe TRILL does).<br /><br />That said though, what is the topology of choice? Obviosuly, a Clos network will have the minimal number of hops but the highest cost in terms of inter-switch links. 2/3/4 dimension Torus or hyper-cubes may also work well (you trade having fewer long links between switches for more hops, but still get massive bisection bandwidth at lower cost). Both of these topologies are widely used in the HPC space.<br /><br />What won&#39;t work with TRILL right now are fancy-pants topologies like Dragonfly, Flattenend Butterfly, etc. that require adaptive or non-minimal routing. But those don&#39;t work with any other mainstream routing protocol either. Maybe someday.<br /><br />It seems as though fabric vendors are just assuming a 2/3 stage Clos network is going to be the design of choice, cost be damned.<br /><br />One question though: What the hell is the difference between a two-stage Clos network and a &quot;leaf and spine&quot; network? Is it just marketing language?",
