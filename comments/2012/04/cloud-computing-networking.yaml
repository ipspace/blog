  html: 'Love your blog, found a typo on slide 17 - http://demo.ipspace.net/get/Cloud%20Computing%20Networking%20EuroNOG.pdf
    - vCDNI is network isolation not network infrastructure.<br /><br />What did you
    mean on slide 14: Nexus 5k - only 250 VLANs verified. I see ~503 as VLAN limit
    on N5010, haven&#39;t hit N5548 limit yet. Can you elaborate on that &quot;verified&quot;
    bit? Thanks.'

  html: The &quot;Verified&quot; number comes from Nexus 5000 Configuration Limits.
    At the time that presentation was made, they verified up to 250 (or so) VLANs
    on Nexus 5000, with the latest software (as of this moment), the number has been
    increased to 507<br /><br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/configuration_limits/limits_513/nexus_5000_config_limits_513.html#wp347800
