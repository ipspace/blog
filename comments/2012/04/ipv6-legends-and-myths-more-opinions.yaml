  html: Ivan, I couldn&#39;t agree more.<br /><br />You know, the more I think about
    it and the more conversations with customers I have, I think the biggest problem
    is fear. When you get right down to it, a large number of &quot;sysadmins&quot;
    (particularly those in my customer base who are part of a small team and thus
    have to be multi-skilled) actually don&#39;t understand how IPv4, NAT, DHCP or
    other technologies really work. They&#39;ve been used to putting certain numbers
    in certain boxes because that&#39;s how they&#39;ve always been taught to do it
    and that&#39;s what makes it work(ish). Indeed, many of these people have been
    taught badly.<br /><br />So, when you try and add a new varient on a technology
    they don&#39;t have a fundamental knowledge that they can fall back on - rather
    it&#39;s a paralysing fear of a thing that they just don&#39;t understand. Not
    letting go of what they know is not letting go of the security blanket of a set
    of habits that they call &quot;the way it&#39;s done&quot;.

  html: "Hey!  First off, thanks for taking the time to read my article.  Secondly,\
    \ if I may, I&#39;d like to take the time to offer a few counter points and clarifications.\
    \  (No, I am not out to start a flame war.)<br /><br />Regarding the lack of consumer/SME\
    \ gear, I never intended to indicate that none existed at all.  Certainly some\
    \ does; even Dlink is starting to ship some gear that is (for the most part) IPv6\
    \ capable.  The issue is one of quality and usability.  &quot;Will pass IPv6 packets&quot;\
    \ is a heck of a lot different than &quot;gives you a single point of management\
    \ for your whole network.&quot;  (As current IPv4 cheap-o CPE stuff does.)<br\
    \ /><br />IPv6 consumer gear largely expects everything will autoconfigure, won&#39;t\
    \ need to worry about things like renumbering, and generally are just dumb consumer\
    \ devices that do nothing but consume content.  It expects individual devices\
    \ to manage their own firewalls and thus offer really terrible ACL/firewall support.\
    \  (Thus Johnny Cyberphreak can crawl down your tubes and pwn your toaster with\
    \ relative ease.)<br /><br />Again; the statement in my article was never intended\
    \ to say that no gear existed at all, but simply that it is both exceptionally\
    \ rare and most of what exists borders on unfit for the described purpose.<br\
    \ /><br />The &quot;no more static addresses thing&quot; was NOT a reference to\
    \ an inability to statically address a given system in IPv6.  It was instead a\
    \ reference to the inability to reasonably and reliably static address these systems\
    \ in an environment where renumbering was going to take place.<br /><br />Autorenumbering\
    \ tech?  Not until you have a completely bulletproof implementation of all relevant\
    \ technologies in a single widget for a sub-$100 price with a dead-simple interface<br\
    \ /><br />As to DHCP/DNS/etc &quot;just working,&quot; we&#39;re going to have\
    \ to agree to disagree.  I have seen all sorts of things that can break these\
    \ setups.  It&#39;s more common than we&#39;d like to think.<br /><br />\u201C\
    NAT is the solution.\u201D  Hell no.  NAT is a terrible, kludge.  I personally\
    \ do not believe NAT (or NPT66) is the right solution to the problems I listed.\
    \  I do however think that it is the solution that works right now, today.  Unfortunately\
    \ for us all, that is all that will *ever* matter to SMEs.<br /><br />Potential\
    \ solutions, solutions that are more expensive than current ones, solutions that\
    \ don&#39;t deliver immediate and obvious value, or solutions that require things\
    \ like &quot;trusting your ISPs to play ball and not be douchenozzles&quot; will\
    \ simply never fly.<br /><br />Part 2 to follow\u2026"

  html: "In the end, the purpose of my article was to highlight the fact that the\
    \ purity of the technical solution *doesn&#39;t matter* to the average Joe.  You\
    \ know how to properly implement an IPv6 network.  I know how to properly implement\
    \ an IPv6 network.  We both know enough to build this stuff out of duct tape and\
    \ glue if we have to.<br /><br />But that&#39;s irrelevant.  What matters is *simple*\
    \ and *cheap*.  NAT solves the problems (real or imagined) that SMEs and consumers\
    \ see when they look at IPv6.  If we want to prevent NAT from gaining any sort\
    \ of hold, then we have to put our hubris aside, accept that IPv6&#39;s marketing,\
    \ message and CPE implementations were an [expletive deleted] hatchet job, and\
    \ focus on the money, not the technical purity considerations.<br /><br />You\
    \ aren&#39;t dealing with a base of &quot;sysadmins&quot; who know what an IPv4\
    \ header looks like and can tell you what the community string of an SNMP packet\
    \ is by slapping wireshark on a line.  Instead, you have \u201Csysadmin-as-a-second-jobbers\u201D\
    \ who know only that they need to run a mailserver and a webserver and a what-have-you,\
    \ on the cheap. They need to do it from the consumer-grade DSL connection they\
    \ can afford and they need to do it with the shoestring equipment they can find\
    \ at the local Best Buy.<br /><br />The disconnect between this world and the\
    \ world inhabited by IPv6ers needs highlighting, the gap needs bridging.  And\
    \ the current culture of \u201Cscorn and belittle people into complying\u201D\
    \ will achieve the opposite results from those desired.<br /><br />I felt it was\
    \ worth clarifying that, and sorry for the longwindedness of my post.<br /><br\
    \ />I am planning a follow-up article probably towards the end of next month.\
    \  If you would like to work with me to present a &quot;IPv6-with-no-compromises\
    \ for environments where the word &quot;Cisco&quot; means &quot;too much money&quot;&quot;\
    \ style article I will entirely welcome the collaboration.<br /><br />I have written\
    \ the article to get the IPv6ers riled up and thinking about the problem.  At\
    \ some point I hope that enough of the right people get angry enough about it\
    \ that I can write about real world solutions to these problems that fit in the\
    \ real-world price points and usability requirements of the target audience I\
    \ was discussing in my article.<br /><br />The ability to say \u201Chere is how\
    \ you do IPv6 right, for dirt cheap, never have to worry about renumbering, its\
    \ a completely bulletproof solution, can do multihoming and it is as easy as using\
    \ a pfsense firewall with NPT66\u201D would be a wonderful followup.<br /><br\
    \ />In the meantime, I hope my article has caused some people to think about the\
    \ problems faced by those living on the frugal edge.  Maybe they will even look\
    \ to addressing them."

    html: NAT by itself is a decent concept. However, it was even a more stupid idea
      to implement NAT back then as a way to deal with IPv4 exhaustion. Because it
      would have been much easier to implement a protocol with a bigger address space
      when the Internet was small and simple. <br />   And the big elephant in the
      room is that they <b>didn&#39;t NEED NAT back then</b>. With CIDR we had enough
      IP addresses for every Internet host until the early 2000s. We actually don&#39;t
      need NAT now. There are only about 1.5 billion hosts on the Internet. If the
      addresses were not hoarded by corporation like HP or IBM, every home user could
      have a public IP address on their PC. <br />Instead of using NAT, they (back
      in the 90s) could have migrated to IPv6 as early as possible, because waiting
      is a truly stupid strategy. The more you delay doing your homework, they harder
      it would be when you actually have to do it.

  html: Totally agree with you regarding the lack of proper IPv6 support in low-end
    devices. Please start hammering the low-end vendors and start requesting support
    for at least &quot;Basic Requirements for IPv6 CPE&quot;:<br /><br />http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router-09<br
    /><br />And I&#39;m glad we&#39;re agreeing on the kludginess of NAT  :-P

  html: Yet again, in perfect agreement on the &quot;the knowledge gap needs bridging&quot;,
    but I honestly don&#39;t know what else to do than to put the information out
    there (and there are tons of people doing that).<br /><br />As for non-BGP multihoming
    with IPv6, we won&#39;t see a proper solution for a while, and it will probably
    require changes to host IPv6 stacks as well (great news, isn&#39;t it).

  html: As I said in my own missive about this, NAT is coming to IPv6 whether we like
    it or not:<br /><br />http://phoneboy.com/4289/nat-is-coming-to-ipv6-whether-we-like-it-or-not<br
    /><br />Not only SMEs have issues with multihoming, but large businesses want
    to use NAT to ensure symmetric traffic flows on their multihomed link. <br /><br
    />If the industry/standards bodies can come up with a less kludgy, NAT-free solution
    to both issues, we&#39;re all ears. Meanwhile, people will continue to clamor
    for NAT because everyone knows &quot;it works.&quot;

  html: Ivan, have you read Templin&#39;s IRON proposal? It offers an interesting
    approach to multihoming (as a service, you might say). I realize it would cost
    money, but I suspect it would still be cheaper than BGP and cause less breakage
    than NAT.

  html: After a very cursory glance at the introduction section of the draft, I can&#39;t
    see how it would be significantly different from what LISP is offering. If you
    wish, you could easily deploy LISP-as-a-service with proxy ITR.

    html: It they really wanted they could nail you down from even behind the NAT.
      NAT isn&#39;t really effective to &quot;secretly&quot; add more devices without
      the ISP knowing.<br />Not to mention that the ISP can simply break your connectivity
      so that NATing wouldn&#39;t work.

  html: I consider NAT as a money-saver when connectivity provider charges for the
    service per device. For example, imagine how it affects mobile tethering - if
    no NAT is present, then mobile operator gets to control the end number of devices
    via 3G, thus including the charge on tethering (which is being done in France
    even now, I guess though analysis of the traffic..)<br /><br />Another situation
    - when CPE can provide only one IP address per port (because it is designed to
    do so), and then you are stuck with laptop with 3 VMs inside..)<br /><br />Vilius

      mDNS. No normal person is going to set up a DNS server in their house.

  html: Why not a solution that is actually somewhat human readable? The biggest problem
    I see with ipv6 is simple. Get on the phone and tell someone to go to, say, 192.168.0.104.
    Pretty easy, right? Now get on the phone and tell someone to go to 2001:0:9d38:953c:3c5e:367c:3f57:fffd.
    Not so easy, now, is it? IPV6 addresses are simply garbage. Would have been much
    simpler and easier for everyone to just add another .xxx to ipv4 if we needed
    the address space (which we don&#39;t but that&#39;s another conversation). IPv6
    is a thinly veiled attempt to extort yearly fees paid to the standards bodies.
    That, coupled with the basic unreadability and unusability of ipv6 have ensured
    it will never take off. Period.<br />

  html: I absolutely agree with Iueras regarding IPv6 addresses. They are monstrous,
    ugly and impossible to remember, communicate or use in any sensible way. Why can&#39;t
    we get a new protocol? IPv6 failed. It&#39;s been around since 1998! We&#39;ve
    had it forever and its usage rate is still pathetically low.<br /><br />The second
    problem is that not everyone wants all their devices publicly addressable. I think
    a lot of people feel more comfortable being behind a home router, not just for
    the firewall but because someone can&#39;t go after their individual devices by
    address when NAT is employed.<br /><br />We need something else. IPv6 is a failure.
    Period. Next idea, please?<br />
