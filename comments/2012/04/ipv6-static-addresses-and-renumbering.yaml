  html: Ivan,<br /><br />Security-by-obscurity with the IPv4 NAT is a &quot;good-enough&quot;
    arrangement for small networks, where there is no need for the big bad Internet
    to make direct contact with all the unpatched office PCs with RDP enabled on them.<br
    /><br />What&#39;s in your opinion the best way of achieving the same with IPv6?<br
    /><br />P.S. I do sort-of buy the &quot;the apps will work better when all hosts
    cat talk to each other directly&quot;; however when it comes to choosing between
    the convenience of being able to run crappily designed protocols/apps and providing
    a however basic level of isolation from the raw Internet without additional effort,
    I choose the second without batting an eyelid.

  html: Juniper has a simple regex search/replace which can replace patterns in the
    whole config. Doing a renumbering would be as easy as:<br /><br />replace pattern
    &quot;2001:db8:1:&quot; with &quot;2001:db8:2:&quot;

  html: You should really use a stateful firewall on the edge router ... and it should
    be enabled by default on low-end boxes (like consumer CPE devices).

  html: Thats something that flows through my mind for quite some time now. What is
    the drawback of using ULAs within the whole network and only address the devices
    that need direct (no proxy in between) access to the internet with global addresses?<br
    /><br />All internal devices could go through a proxy (how it is done today in
    a lot of companies) to get to the internet.

  html: '&gt; it should be enabled by default on low-end boxes (like consumer CPE
    devices)<br /><br />...that is, if they have it. Just checked one of those - Apple
    AirPort Extreme, doesn&#39;t have one. Has DHCP, has NAT. No firewall. I suspect
    situation may be not much better for others. Firewall is tricky, compared to NAT.
    And more resource-intensive.<br /><br />Sigh.'

  html: Baseline firewall is exactly the same thing as PAT. You need stateful inspection
    and ALG for FTP and SIP in both cases. Too bad the cheapo vendors don&#39;t get
    it.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />i have seen some NAT &quot;magic&quot; done at the loadbalancer
    or stateful firewalls because of asymmetric routing behind that barrier. otherwise
    the returning packet would not go through the same firewall and would be dropped.<br
    />How would you solve this problem with IPv6?<br /><br />thanks!<br /><br />BR,<br

  html: i know my question is not really related to the static addresses and renumbering
    topic but the question came just to my mind...

  html: Did you have to open that particular can of worms  :-P Every time I have to
    think about this, I get frustratingly mad at the shortsightedness IETF had 20
    years ago ... not to mention the TCPng fiasco.<br /><br />Load balancing in IPv6
    works exactly the same as in IPv4. Nothing you can do to change it. <br /><br
    />You might make it more anycast-ish with LISP (and lose some of the fast failure
    detection and dynamic balancing capabilities), but the problem is that it would
    work well only if you have enough ITRs.

  html: the 50euros per year per prefix is based on that you do have a sposonring
    LIR  ie your ISP. And you do have to go thru the process of applying for a /48
    from RIPE. So the costs /time involved would be a bit more expensive than that.
