  html: Hello! I&#39;m just wondering about; Is the storm-control feature (configured
    with carefully measured thresholds) combined with BPDU guard can help you! (With
    storm control you can limit the number of the broadcast, multicast and unicast
    frames received on a port).<br /><br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2950/software/release/12.1_22ea/SCG/swtrafc.html#wp1229854

    control sense.

  html: Bridging doesn&#39;t suck, it just needs to be implemented properly.  Storm
    control is always a good idea.  MAC filtering / limiting in campus networks is
    very effective.  For DCs TRILL is a very good option, particularily for those
    that have already architected with the requirement for some form of layer 2 within
    their DC.

    of his VLANs (how many hosts/ports) because this surprise me that the storm is
    so brutal (too many broadcast? Multicast?)!

  html: I guess it depends a lot on the switch type you&#39;re using, its CPU power,
    and its control-plane protection. Once you get a single broadcast in a forwarding
    loop (ARP request would be a perfect fit as it has to hit the switch&#39;s CPU
    as well), it can swamp the CPU, which then stops processing and sending BPDU,
    resulting in a neat meltdown.

  html: While STP loops can be bad news they should never crash a switch, the OS should
    be able to deal with high CPU utilization and fairly schedule tasks. As part of
    acceptance testing I always encourage tests that focus on how a switch deals with
    very high CPU utilization, by running switches in the test network at 90%+ CPU
    utilization and ensuring the control plane integrity (e.g. no neighbors are dropped,
    STP is stable, MLAG/vPC peers remain active, etc...). This is a challenge of a
    converged control plane many vendors are pushing while it does give you fewer
    switches to manage it also has the ability to take out more switch ports, as well
    as drive higher CPU utilization on the switch...

    html: Dmitri, sounds like you are referring to UDLD, unidirectional link detection.
      This will err-disable a port when unidirectional traffic is detected when it
      is not expected, usually on fiber interfaces.

  html: '&quot;I have to mention that these access ports are configured with Root,
    BDPU guard as well as Portfast.&quot;<br /><br />Wrong. Well, it depends I guess
    if he configured portfast on port or globally. If configured on port then the
    port will always be in portfast mode but if configured globally then the port
    would revert out of its portfast mode if a BPDU is received. Another common mistake
    is to use both bpdu filter and root/bpdu guard on a port. The filter will take
    precedence and the guards will never be used.<br /><br />Brads solution is of
    course the best but maybe not always an option.<br /><br />Storm control and port-security
    should also be configured if possible. <br /><br />The ARP situation you mention
    is very interesting, I&#39;ve seen this before, one single packet can wreak havoc.<br
    /><br />Another interesting situation can occur when customer creates loop. Say
    that you have customers connecting to a l2 network via some triple play box and
    they accidentally create a loop locally. Even if your backbone is protected from
    the backbones perspective this is not really a loop. It&#39;s just a lot of traffic
    coming from the customer which could be ARP or other traffic and this is very
    difficult to protect against unless you own the CPE or at least configure it.'

  html: In practice I have seen that if you configure loopguard, udld on the uplink
    ports of the switches, the core/distribution switch will shutdown the uplink port
    of the access switch where the loop was created, limiting the impact of the loop
    to the rest of the LAN. <br />Probably this happens because the affected switch
    is in 100% cpu and cannot send BPDUs, udld packets

  html: Ivan, one small thought and I know you are certainly aware of this but &quot;STP
    loop&quot; is a misnomer. Spanning-Tree doesn&#39;t cause loops, it prevents them.
    The issue was actually caused by a bridging loop that spanning-tree didn&#39;t
    detect in time because of incompatible STP enhancements.<br /><br />STP is a great
    protocol ... for the 1990s.

  html: I&#39;ve similarly seen this when an IP phone will bridge two vlans if it&#39;s
    plugged into the switch twice (by a user of course ;) ) and the switchports aren&#39;t
    on the same vlan. Any aux voice vlan bpdu&#39;s won&#39;t be understood by the
    native data vlan (untagged). <br /><br />As for bpdu filter, it always helps to
    remember the different behavior if enabled globally vs. on the switchport directly;
    If you enable bpdu filter globally and portfast on a switchport, it will prevent
    that switchport from sending BPDUs. However, if that port receives a BPDU, the
    port loses it&#39;s portfast state, disables BPDUfilter and becomes a normal STP
    port. If you enable bpdu filter on a switchport directly, then that disables STP
    on that port -- ie. wont send BPDUs and it will ignore inbound BPDUs.

    - all good. But you&#39;d still have an issue on that switch, if two ports are
    looped, right?

  html: The affected switch is exposed only to broadcasts from the users on that switch,
    not the entire network, so the severity is vastly minimized. Worst case scenario
    one switch melts.  Not the whole network.

  html: Ivan, broadcast,multicast and unicast-unknown rate-limit / storm control is
    the best solution. Having a loop detection protocol like Extreme&#39;s ELRP is
    a great tool , but I don&#39;t know abou any (non-STP) based equivalent in IOS.
    Cheers!<br /><br />P.S. Also its better if you have a MRTG/RRD graphs, drawing
    the non-unicast pps per port.

  html: Regarding limiting the number of MAC addresses accepted on the switch port,
    what is a decent default for this value?<br /><br />We can&#39;t really set that
    to 1, as anyone experimenting with virtual machines will run into issues.  Is
    setting the mac address limit to something like 20 still helpful?  I would hope
    that setting it to 20 would be high enough to prevent causing issues with any
    legitimate activity, but still low enough to prevent loops.

  html: In this particular case, I would say it&#39;s improper implementation. <br
    /><br />The switch should send several BPDUs on a portfast port after it transitions
    to enabled and delay forwarding for a second or two (to check for potential loops).
    <br /><br />Whatever alternate protocol (LLDP would be the best bet) could be
    used to detect loops in case someone thinks using BPDUs is not a good idea, and
    the port should not go into forwarding state until the basic are-we-looping checks
    have been performed.

  html: Bring back DECnet.  Anyone watched Radia Perlman&#39;s GoogleTalk video?  She
    talks about how she lost her battle to have layer 3 networking to short-sighted
