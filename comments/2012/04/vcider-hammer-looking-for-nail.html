            <div class="comment-content">Hello Ivan,<br /><br />You are raising some good points there about the challenges of setting<br />up high availability clusters across network boundaries. Before I<br />comment on them, please note that lately we have started to blog about<br />some of our customers&#39; applications and use cases. We are always<br />interested - sometimes even surprised - about the many different ways in<br />which people use vCider. Occasionally we just want to share a few of<br />those things on our blog.<br /><br />Of course, that doesn&#39;t mean that vCider is limited to just those<br />particular applications. For example, for many of our customers it is<br />not even so much about L2 connectivity, but about the ability to manage<br />IP address space, replicate entire network topologies and of course<br />about security, which for many of them is one of our main features.<br /><br />So, if you are asking about the &#39;nail&#39;, which the &#39;vCider hammer&#39; is<br />looking for: You may be able to find other tools for all the different<br />nails you encounter, but our users find that vCider is a pretty good<br />hammer for many of the nails they need to deal with. Not just a single<br />nail.<br /><br />When I wrote this particular blog about the IP address failover, I<br />thought I&#39;d combine it with the example of the gateway to connect a<br />virtual network to the enterprise. Big mistake! Many people were thrown<br />off by that, since it ends up just distracting from the main point. And<br />you are right: In that particular example I described, a load balancer<br />would probably be the easier solution.<br /><br />In hindsight now, to demonstrate the utility of IP address failover, I<br />think a much better example would have been the case where a larger<br />portion of the customer&#39;s network is in the cloud, some servers and also<br />some clients. If all of them are connected on a vCider network, then you<br />don&#39;t need to force traffic (from all clients to all servers) through a<br />load balancer somewhere (bottleneck, single point of failure, funny<br />shaped &quot;traffic trombones&quot;, etc.). Instead, all clients instantly now<br />are informed about a server failover. That&#39;s exactly what Linux-HA can<br />do so well with a gratuitous ARP. With vCider you can now use this well<br />established solution even in your cloud networks.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Thank you for the comment. Yet again, it seems we&#39;re in perfect agreement ... and as you wrote - if you would have used an example where you use vCider to build a typical enterprise HA app stack at Amazon or Rackspace, it would make perfect sense (not the enterprise HA stack, but the use of vCider to implement it).</div>
