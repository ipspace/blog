      "html": "THANK YOU!  You just put into words the idea that has been bouncing around in my mind for the past few months.  Ever since I read about Brocade (Foundary) VCS, I&#39;ve been struggling with the thought that &quot;something isn&#39;t right&quot; with full mesh.  As far as I can tell, Brocade is advocating full mesh because they have no large VCS capable switches.  Their answer seems to be to just mesh the ToR switches and argue that you don&#39;t need a large switch for aggregation.  Since I&#39;ve been seeing that same argument in several places, I thought that I must either be dumber than I thought or just missing something very obvious!",

      "html": "A very simple change to forwarding model, known as Valiant Load Balancing (VLB) makes full-mesh topology (aka k-ary 1-flat butterfly) fully load-balanced. VLB is fairly easy to implement on a proprietary fabric, as long as underlying chipset supports encap-decap functionality (in fact I did thate even in dynamips lol). There is a tradeoff, of course - the throughput is reduced by 50%, though this still way better as compared to minimal routing.<br /><br />It is also possibly to utilize practically full capacity in the fully meshed fabric by using adaptive routing methods, which are, however, harder to implement. For instance, you can run a full-mesh of MPLE-TE tunnels ;) Though this model has way too slow response time to be used in data-center. <br /><br />Overall, adaptive routing has been a big area of research in 70-90s for HPC systems, and a lot of interesting results could be borrowed from there. It&#39;s just that modern DC&#39;s are built from commodity gear which normally has pretty limited functionality.",

      "html": "First off, great write up as usual.<br /><br />And I will in fairness say that there could be applications written in the future that take advantage of more full mesh designs. And it does depend on your design goals, bandwidth vs latency vs consistency vs resiliency etc. As Plapukhov stated above, there are ways to do full mesh to one&#39;s benefit today. That is just not how we do things today in datacenters, and my guess is we won&#39;t any time soon. <br /><br />But for the most part ever since Charles Clos released his work in 1953 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clos_network communications have proven time and time again that a CLOS based architecture gives the best performance. <br /><br />This is illustrated (somewhat humorously) by the fact that if you build a full mesh fabric today that most if not all of the switches you would be using to do so have inside them asics on a board that are in CLOS configuration. <br /><br />For most applications today CLOS ROCKS.",

      "html": "Hmm... I&#39;m not sure what you were told, all of the VCS reference designs that I know of are NOT full all-2-all mesh networks. There are usually 2 tier clos networks. <br /><br />I personally do talk in some of my presentations that things like TRILL mean you can more safely look at new topologies like full mesh and others and that we may see more of that in the future. But I know of no datacenter application today that would be helped by a full mesh topology.<br /><br />If you can point me to where you saw this I&#39;m more than happy to look into it. It&#39;s very possible that it&#39;s simply the miss use of the phrase &quot;full mesh&quot;.",

(sorry, i won&#39;t be able to make that) but at least a drive-by reference to some of the merits of a fat tree clos and the enhancements in asics to facilitate respectable ECMP might put a little more balance on the topic.  to jump from full mesh to a 2-node spine seems to leave out some of the more interesting capabilities of the topology. ;)",

      "html": "I honestly cannot point to a specific reference to full mesh, so that may have been something that started in my mind and had positive reinforcement bias as I have been reading several articles about full mesh (or even partial mesh) recently.<br /><br />Not to go too far off of the topic of this blog, the main issue that jumped out to me was the limitation of only 24 switches in a VCS fabric.  If 2+ switches are used as spine nodes, that would leave 22 or less for leaf nodes.  I guess that led me to the thought that you would want to be able to use all available nodes as leaf nodes, and my mind constructed the idea of a full mesh to accomplish this.  <br /><br />Given that their largest switch supporting VCS (that I know of) is the VDX6730-76 with 60 ethernet ports, I would assume 4 spine nodes to allow full bandwidth within the fabric (2 spine nodes wouldn&#39;t have enough ports for 4 uplinks each from all 22 leaf nodes).  That leaves only 20 leave nodes, with 52 ports each as your maximum access port count, and even then it&#39;s at 6.5:1 oversubscription.",
