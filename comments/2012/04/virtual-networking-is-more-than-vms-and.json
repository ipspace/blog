I suspect that what you&#39;re describing will probably look more like the diagram in the attached image. Pardon for crappiness (and I didn&#39;t include the DB layer), but hopefully it gives an idea.<br /><br />BTW I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m using correct network types; hopefully Massimo chimes in and sets the record straight. ;)",

Also, in a modern server environment, it&#39;s not necessarily a good assumption that applications are deployed or updates are applied to live VMs; some of us design applications to allow us to throw away and replace VMs rather than update/fix them in place.",

Another way our customers stand up the multi-zone/multi-tier apps is by placing the members into multiple VXLAN/vCDNI-based networks or VLAN and connect them to the same perimeter firewall/router device (in our case Edge). Edge is no longer limited to a single outside/inside interface pair. Agreed around the static routing comment - all I can say on that front is stay tuned :-) ",
