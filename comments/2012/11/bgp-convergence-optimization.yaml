  html: Why in the world would you want to receive the full  internet prefix list
    in an active/standby uplink design? Have your providers advertise a default route
    to you if you&#39;re not going to do intelligent egress selection.

  html: In principle I agree with you ... unless your provider happens to be someone
    known for peering spats and unilateral de-peering actions.<br /><br />Some people
    think it&#39;s safer to get full feed from both providers just in case one of
    them is missing a prefix or two.
