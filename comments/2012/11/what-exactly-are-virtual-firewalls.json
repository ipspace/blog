IMHO virtualization firewalls like Cisco&#39;s VSG and Juniper&#39;s vGW covered in your previous post about firewall taxonomy will play an important role in &quot;cloud security&quot;. The SPI function is not much different than on traditional firewalls altough the management model and rule syntax is much richer because of the wareness of the VM context e.g. VM name, port groups, host affinity, etc.<br /><br />As for the MPLS-firewall combo. although not a firewall per se an ASA service module in a 650x does support MPLS, VRF, GRE, etc. plus some interesting features like VSS. Also stability is relative good on that platform.",

Maybe the small models, but certainly not the bigger ones.<br /><br />Also, there&#39;s a big difference between different vendors as far as virtualisation on their appliances goes. Some do it fluently, others lose functionality in the process (VPN termination on those virtual contexts, layer 2 functionality, failover). One vendor I&#39;ve seen recently even had trouble routing overlapping IP ranges in their separate virtual firewalls. It&#39;s not a mature technology everywhere yet.",

How about a socket-compress IF-MAP arbitrarily sharing state between firewalls subscribing to it?  Virtualizing would be relatively simple.  The relationship between any two security zones can be uniquely ID&#39;d.  Any state between these zones will be tagged with that ID.  Any firewall interested in this state can subscribe to it.",
