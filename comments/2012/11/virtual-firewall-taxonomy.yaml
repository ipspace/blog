  html: And many of physical firewalls can be virtualized. So one physical firewall
    can have multiple virtual firewalls inside. They all have their own routing table,
    rule base and management interface.<br /><br />This is also another meaning for
    virtual firewalls.

    html: Nevot, if you&#39;re associated with Palo Alto Networks in any way and think
      I misrepresented what they do, put me in touch with the technical people that
      would correct my myopia.<br /><br />If this is a generic &quot;that might be
      interesting&quot; type of comment - thank you, will put it on my to-investigate
      list (but that list is long and getting longer).

    html: I cannot comment on nevots affiliation, I am not involved with Palo Alto
      however. But I have seen colleagues using Palo Alto boxes (don&#39;t ask me
      which ones), and they can do pretty impressive stuff. As far as I understood,
      the boxes are L7 firewalls which do pattern matching on packet contents in hardware
      and virtually in line speed. They have rules for most protocols, eg. you can
      have rules that deny certain operations of the SMB protocol. <br /><br />So
      yes, I think Palo Alto is pretty interesting :). Since I only know the comments
      on Palo Alto by my colleagues, I am also interested in what you think about
      them.<br /><br />Btw the guy starting the company (Nir Zuk) started Netscreen
      before (now part of Juniper), AFAIK they did the first implementation of stateful
      packet inspection in hardware. I have worked with Netscreen boxes before, and
      I like them, so I am probably a little bit biased. <br />

    html: 'FWIW: Nir Zuk started up OneSecure, which was acquired by Netscreen for
      their IPS technology in 2002. Netscreen&#39;s CTO at  startup was Ken Xie, who
      went on to start Fortinet after the Juniper deal. <br /><br />Both Juniper IPS
      and many parts of Fortinet seem similar to Netscreen of old. '

  html: There are at least some open source &quot;bump-in-the-wire inter-VLAN virtual
    firewalls&quot;, i think for example pfSync in transparent mode fits into this
    category.

  html: No, not related to PA, only user.<br />That is, they say they are doing stateful
    inspection and application recognition on hardware (FPGAs), and I only wanted
    to know your opinion, related to your previous statement.<br /><br />Put it to
    your list. It may be great reading a post about them.<br /><br />Regards!

  html: "Well we just did a PoC on a couple of PA-5050\xB4s.<br /><br />They failed\
    \ because.<br /><br />-No IPV6 hardware acceleration and broken IPV6 if over 50%\
    \ CPU ( will get fixed in 5.0)<br /><br />-Very high cpu usage if you have alot\
    \ of HTTP traffic.<br />We had about 65% cpu usage for 1 gbps of traffic.<br /><br\
    \ />-Support didnt work. It took them over 5 weeks to identify a problem with\
    \ Syn Cookies. Over 50% cpu and syn cookies enabled would result in packet drops.<br\
    \ /><br />This is just the list with the major issues we had.<br />The Palo Alto\
    \ platform is not wirespeed for sure. If somebody wants all the data please contact\
    \ me.<br /><br /><br />So right now we are running FortiNET 3950B in a PoC with\
    \ 3 XH0 Securti engiens.<br /><br />FortiNET actually do alot of IPS in ASICS\
    \ or FPGA.<br /><br />We are only seeing 6% CPU with the same amount of traffic.<br\
    \ /><br /><br />The Palo Alto gui feels very modern compared to the FortiNET but\
    \ the engineering is not very solid compared to FortiNET.<br /><br />"

  html: Check out Embrane solution, I used it and for my tasks nothing is lack. I
    think it&#39;s a perfect multi tenant virtual and scalable solution.

  html: 'I&#39;m amazed at all the limpy, barely-there virtual security products that
    try to pass for firewalls -- e.g., vShield Edge, vShield App, and Cisco&#39;s
    VSG. These are are glorified L2/L3/L4 packet filters, barely able to tell an ARP
    from an NDP and with a &quot;kitschy UI in front of Linux iptables&quot; (thanks
    Ivan!). Consider their Application layer gateway (ALG) support:<br /><br />  vShield
    Edge: FTP<br />  vShield App: FTP, Microsoft RPC, Linux RPC, Sun RPC, Oracle TNS<br
    />  Cisco VSG: FTP, RSH, and TFTP<br /><br />Shouldn&#39;t intra-tenant security
    have more protocol awareness than a perimeter firewall? E.g., infrastructure protocols
    (NFS, CIFS/SMB, DNS, LDAP, MS RPC with UUID discrimination), application protocols
    (HTTP, Oracle, SIP, SMTP, RTSP), and the app data (SQL, SOAP, XML). Now, this
    veers dangerously into WAF and IPS territory but, IMHO, what&#39;s the point of
    doing intra-tenant security without understanding the apps?<br /><br />vShield
    App might have a nice GUI, but it&#39;s actual security protection is no better
    than L4 ACL&#39;s on the free Nexus 1000v combined with the firewall built-in
    to every modern OS. If it was my security budget, I&#39;d start with that, add
    a solid perimeter firewall, and then throw every remaining dollar at badass IPS
    and WAF vendors -- SourceFire, Imperva, TippingPoint, etc.<br />'
