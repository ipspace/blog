VM techs are already complaining about having to get pre-assigned Vlans, pre-configured Vlans, and even pre-assigned addressing.  The automation is making management drool so much that I do not think the network group can keep fighting it.  <br /><br />Now how to troubleshoot random IP addressing, random vlan IDs, and server sprawl.  I really think my group should take charge of VCD and I think Vmware feels the same after their application realignment.  I&#39;m not even sure VCD can provision servers any longer with latest update.",

Also thinking before those conclusions, some questions around automation and orchestration, which hypervisor and vswitch technology were being used, and number of DCs would have been great to know too.<br /><br />Why dismiss VXLAN at the 100s of servers (10s of physical hosts) so soon?  Could be useful for inter-DC mobility.  Thoughts or should I wait for the webinar :)<br /><br />-Jason",

I think I know where you stand on that.<br /><br />Okay, control plane to stay as-is if it must for now, but a controller and/or Vcenter to manipulate and auto configure VXLAN gateways would still be of value for those daring enough to extend a VXLAN between sites.  Possibly just a mirror of the VXLAN gw at the other site...just thinking out loud now. ;)",

Wouldn&#39;t it address this problem ? <br /><br />Also VXLAN provides us with two functions: LAN extension and scalable network isolation. As many of us have learned the hard way, LAN extension needs to be deployed with care lest you L2 problems in one location suddenly become L2 problems in all your locations ie ... broadcast storms or some network worm outbreak.  OTV solves fault isolation amongst location. In saying that broadcasting across  WAN in my opinion is sloppy. Its not a preferred inter connect DC solution  <br /><br /><br />Allen Baylis ",
