  html: So this is usually relevant when Spit-Horizon is disabled? I always have a
    difficult time coming up with a situation where Split-Horizon is enabled but a
    loop might still occur if not for the Feasibility Condition.

  html: The simple rule is once a new route passes through a router with a particular
    metric, the looped route via the same router can NEVER have a metric lower than
    the intial metric...this is the crux of FC.

  html: To Yosef&#39;s point - The situation in the final picture can only happen
    with split-horizon disabled.  If not, B will not advertise the route to the segment
    back to A since it learned it on that interface.  I&#39;ve always wondered as
    well if there is a situation where you could end up with looped routes based purely
    on metrics with traditional prevention mechanisms like split-horizon enabled or
    of the FC was designed to deal specifically with situations like shown above...

  html: The FC check prevents the feasible successor from being immediately installed
    in the routing table, and forces the query/response game (using the last known
    good metric as the measuring stick). If you increase the diameter just a bit (like
    adding D between A and B), it&#39;s easier to see a race condition of advertisements,
    that IF they were installed in the routing table immediately, temporary loops
    would occur (until re-reconvergence). Even if split horizon is enabled, when all
    links are healthy, A and B do exchange their best path (directly to C), and if
    both links to C go down (silly, I know, since C owns the subnet), and A and B
    ignored the feasibily check, they would temporarily route traffic to C&#39;s LAN
    IP until they poison-reversed, etc. If we add a few routers in the mix, it gets
    messier during convergence, which is why there is a feasibility check. My question
    has always been (and this article reminded me), why FD must be less than RD, and
    not less than OR equal to. If RD is higher, we know loops can occur, but I cannot
    come up with a situation where if AD=RD, there is a loop.

    html: No. EIGRP would never use a path if the next hop is not a feasible successor.

  html: but if we use variance there may loop isn&#39;t it?

    html: 'MTU is a tie-breaker: if more than &quot;maximum-paths&quot; EIGRP paths
      have the same metric then MTU is used to select the best N (at least that was
      how it worked the last time I checked). <br /><br />There might be a post explaining
      that behavior somewhere on this web site (don&#39;t remember whether I wrote
      it or not).'

  html: "Guys. Can anyone help me to understand why MTU is not used to calculate metric\
    \ by EIGRP although it is avilable to switch on. I have realised in one of my\
    \ practise that MTU didnt play any role on metric calculation regardless to k1=1,k2=1,\
    \ k3=1, k4=1, k5=1. If it is not used for what purpose does it exist? I dont mention\
    \ default k values. Thanks beforehand\u2026."

  html: "&quot;Based on the link costs (I\u2019m using scalar metrics for simplicity),\
    \ C advertises the LAN IP prefix with cost=5. B adds its own incoming link cost\
    \ (12), reporting the total cost of 17 to A (RD = 17).&quot;<br /><br />Shouldn&#39;t\
    \ it be (FD=17) ?"
