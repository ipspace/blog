  html: 'Thank you for the detailed and precise explanation. <br /><br />VXLAN seems
    to get a lot of support from the industry and recently Linux as of v3.7 as well.

    very successful. I noticed that the VXLAN packets are sent with unicast MACs and
    the VXLAN 8Byte header didn&#39;t seem right too!   '
