      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I disagree with a few things here:<br /><br />- &quot;You MUST clear the A flag in the prefixes advertised by the router to enforce DHCPv6 address assignment&quot; - disagree. It is my understanding that the SLAAC (A flag) and DHCPv6 (M flag) are mutually independent. If you set both, the host will obtain addresses from both methods. RFC4861 section 3 says clearly that SLAAC and DHCPv6 is &quot;*and*/or&quot;, not strictly &quot;or&quot;.<br /><br />- &quot;Removing the on-link prefix from the RA messages will stop SLAAC&quot; - if you by this mean &quot;clearing the L flag&quot;, I disagree. SLAAC works for off-link prefixes just as well as for on-link ones. If you on the other hand meant &quot;removing the prefix information option completely&quot;, I agree.<br /><br />- &quot;The routers supporting SLAAC ...&quot; - this is somewhat misleading. Routers don&#39;t support SLAAC, hosts do. The only thing the router does is to inform the host that it may perform SLAAC or not by using the A flag.<br /><br />Other than that, a few other things I&#39;ve found that people often find confusing, include:<br /><br />- The O flag is meaningless if the M flag is set, as the O flag is basically a subset of the M flag.<br /><br />- When it comes to DNS server assignment, there are OS-es that only support DHCPv6 (e.g., Windows), and there are some that only support the RDNSS Option (e.g., Mac OS X 10.6.x). Therefore, for maximum host compatibility, I recommend using both simultaneously.<br /><br />- A prefix information option with both A and L flags unset is meaningless and might as well be removed.<br /><br />- SLAAC can only occur for prefixes with a length of 64, so setting the A flag for other prefix lenghts is meaningless. (The L flag, on the other hand, works for any prefix length.)<br /><br />- DHCPv6 does not carry prefix length information, so a prefix information option with L=1 is the *only* way a host may acquire an on-link route.<br /><br />- Receipt of a RA (with lifetime &gt; 0) will cause the host to install a default route to the RA&#39;s source address. This is the *only* way to advertise a default route in IPv6 (on Ethernet at least), as DHCPv6 cannot carry this information. Furthermore, the RA is guaranteed to come from a link-local address (within fe80::/64), which is crucial in making off-link prefixes work.<br /><br />Tore",

According to the manpage of radvd (which is used for sending the RAs) the lifetime for on-link determination of the prefix will be ignored by the client when set to less than two hours:<br /><br />&gt; AdvValidLifetime seconds|infinity<br />&gt;<br />&gt; The  length  of  time in seconds (relative to the time the packet is sent) that the<br />&gt; prefix is valid for the purpose of on-link determination.  The symbolic value infinity<br />&gt; represents infinity (i.e. a value of all one bits (0xffffffff)). The valid lifetime is<br />&gt; also used by RFC 4862.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Note that clients will ignore AdvValidLifetime of an existing prefix if the lifetime is<br />&gt; below two hours, as required in RFC 4862 Section 5.5.3 point e).<br /><br />I have not read the RFC yet. At least I was able to reduce the lifetime of the routing table entry to two hours. Which however, if this happens in production, is not very helpful.<br />",
