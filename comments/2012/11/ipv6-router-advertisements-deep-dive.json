         "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I disagree with a few things here:<br /><br />- &quot;You MUST clear the A flag in the prefixes advertised by the router to enforce DHCPv6 address assignment&quot; - disagree. It is my understanding that the SLAAC (A flag) and DHCPv6 (M flag) are mutually independent. If you set both, the host will obtain addresses from both methods. RFC4861 section 3 says clearly that SLAAC and DHCPv6 is &quot;*and*/or&quot;, not strictly &quot;or&quot;.<br /><br />- &quot;Removing the on-link prefix from the RA messages will stop SLAAC&quot; - if you by this mean &quot;clearing the L flag&quot;, I disagree. SLAAC works for off-link prefixes just as well as for on-link ones. If you on the other hand meant &quot;removing the prefix information option completely&quot;, I agree.<br /><br />- &quot;The routers supporting SLAAC ...&quot; - this is somewhat misleading. Routers don&#39;t support SLAAC, hosts do. The only thing the router does is to inform the host that it may perform SLAAC or not by using the A flag.<br /><br />Other than that, a few other things I&#39;ve found that people often find confusing, include:<br /><br />- The O flag is meaningless if the M flag is set, as the O flag is basically a subset of the M flag.<br /><br />- When it comes to DNS server assignment, there are OS-es that only support DHCPv6 (e.g., Windows), and there are some that only support the RDNSS Option (e.g., Mac OS X 10.6.x). Therefore, for maximum host compatibility, I recommend using both simultaneously.<br /><br />- A prefix information option with both A and L flags unset is meaningless and might as well be removed.<br /><br />- SLAAC can only occur for prefixes with a length of 64, so setting the A flag for other prefix lenghts is meaningless. (The L flag, on the other hand, works for any prefix length.)<br /><br />- DHCPv6 does not carry prefix length information, so a prefix information option with L=1 is the *only* way a host may acquire an on-link route.<br /><br />- Receipt of a RA (with lifetime &gt; 0) will cause the host to install a default route to the RA&#39;s source address. This is the *only* way to advertise a default route in IPv6 (on Ethernet at least), as DHCPv6 cannot carry this information. Furthermore, the RA is guaranteed to come from a link-local address (within fe80::/64), which is crucial in making off-link prefixes work.<br /><br />Tore",

It&#39;s isolated vlans where you want layer 2 segmentation.</p>\n\n<p>Private vlans with inter-host controls performed at the router are made possible for IPv4 by a combination of local routing, no ip redirects, and local proxy-arp.  However for IPv6, while the first two functions are possible (at least on a Cisco router), the third is not.  It makes sense that IPv6 local proxy-arp is unavailable/impossible since ND is done with multicasts, not broadcasts.  Therefore to get private vlans working with IPv6 you must be able to force the hosts to consider the prefix derived by their address and prefix length to be considered &quot;off-link&quot;, and therefore they should forward all traffic to the default router. (Mimicking the local proxy-arp behaviour).</p>\n\n<p>As I said both Windows and FreeBSD (I&#39;m yet to test Linux) both add the derived prefix to the prefix table when you statically configure an address - despite what they may learn from an RA - and in violation of RFC 5942.  On the other hand if they use SLAAC by learning the prefix from an RA, then if that RA says the prefix is not on-link (L=0) then neither OS adds the prefix to the prefix table.</p>\n\n<p>So I have successfully implemented isolated private vlans with IPv6 with SLAAC/DHCPv6, but not static addressing.  Well, static with /128 prefix lengths work.</p>\n\n<p>Have you ever come across private vlans and IPv6?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n",
