Thanks a lot.<br /><br />First time I&#39;ve heard a router (Cisco IOS) compared to a network analysis tool (ARX, Ipanema).<br /><br />That&#39;s really the network analysis tool&#39;s job(ie ipanema, ARX, Infinistream).  Would anyone really want a wan/lan router that has 80TB RAID?  Seems like too much.",
