            <div class="comment-content">This post was outstandingly great.  Thanks a lot.<br /><br />First time I&#39;ve heard a router (Cisco IOS) compared to a network analysis tool (ARX, Ipanema).<br /><br />That&#39;s really the network analysis tool&#39;s job(ie ipanema, ARX, Infinistream).  Would anyone really want a wan/lan router that has 80TB RAID?  Seems like too much.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">But then again, we&#39;ve been violating both the End-to-end and Simplicity principles for years - NAT, firewalls, load balancers, WAN accelerators, even LAG - all either peek inside the packet beyond the header or maintain state (intelligence) inside the network.<br /><br />The result is that the Transport layer is no longer end-to-end, it is at the mercy of various &quot;black boxes&quot; which have become control points for the Internet.<br /><br />Maybe its because of such pervasive network-level hardware dependence that other Transport layer protocols (SCTP) have not been able to gain any traction.</div>
