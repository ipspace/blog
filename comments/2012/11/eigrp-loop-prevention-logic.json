If not, B will not advertise the route to the segment back to A since it learned it on that interface.  I&#39;ve always wondered as well if there is a situation where you could end up with looped routes based purely on metrics with traditional prevention mechanisms like split-horizon enabled or of the FC was designed to deal specifically with situations like shown above...",

      "html": "The FC check prevents the feasible successor from being immediately installed in the routing table, and forces the query/response game (using the last known good metric as the measuring stick). If you increase the diameter just a bit (like adding D between A and B), it&#39;s easier to see a race condition of advertisements, that IF they were installed in the routing table immediately, temporary loops would occur (until re-reconvergence). Even if split horizon is enabled, when all links are healthy, A and B do exchange their best path (directly to C), and if both links to C go down (silly, I know, since C owns the subnet), and A and B ignored the feasibily check, they would temporarily route traffic to C&#39;s LAN IP until they poison-reversed, etc. If we add a few routers in the mix, it gets messier during convergence, which is why there is a feasibility check. My question has always been (and this article reminded me), why FD must be less than RD, and not less than OR equal to. If RD is higher, we know loops can occur, but I cannot come up with a situation where if AD=RD, there is a loop.",

I have realised in one of my practise that MTU didnt play any role on metric calculation regardless to k1=1,k2=1, k3=1, k4=1, k5=1. If it is not used for what purpose does it exist? I dont mention default k values. Thanks beforehand\u2026.",
