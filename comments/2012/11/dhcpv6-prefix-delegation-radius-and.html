            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;ve another question. Is &quot;delegated-IPv6-prefix&quot; supposed to bootstrap the per-user static? I had this working in 15.1S on ASR1K and suddenly it stopped working after upgrading. I now have to accompany each user with their own routing attributes as well as the delegation. Is this intentional? does anybody know?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Thanks Ivan, it turns out, as you say, the client has to ask in order for us to create the per-user static. In the previous release we were running ,the client didn&#39;t have to ask, the per-user static was just automatically created, we then assumed we could just provision PD attr in RADIUS and it would cover all clients (those supporting PD and those not) , it seems when we went to the next release, the behaviour changed to &quot;only install the per-user static if the client asks for it&quot; so we&#39;ve now started including the framed-ipv6-route attr along with the PD attr. <br />Saying this, the latest build of the next (i.e after ours) release has reverted to the previous behaviour! perhaps it just doesn&#39;t have this new behaviour committed to it.</div>
