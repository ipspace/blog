            <p class="comment-content">Thank you for the detailed and precise explanation. <br /><br />VXLAN seems to get a lot of support from the industry and recently Linux as of v3.7 as well. Has anyone tested the Linux implementation?<br />I gave it a spin and wasn&#39;t very successful. I noticed that the VXLAN packets are sent with unicast MACs and the VXLAN 8Byte header didn&#39;t seem right too!   </p>
