            <div class="comment-content">Owww I like the one with default route pointing to Ethernet interface and proxy arp. Guess what ... I have seen this &quot;trick&quot; being used when customer had /16 allocated to one site, proxy arp enabled, and arp cache had 7000 entries during business hours. MPLS CER just had static route for that /16 pointing exactly towards customer router (switch). Now while this is an interesting way how to summarize, problem was that once in 24 hours router just &quot;froze&quot;. As it turned out, NMS was set to send standard SNMP query to extract routing table and arp cache once in 24 hours. Router must felt very happy to send &gt;7000 entries via SNMP. Fortunately this request can be filtered in snmp views on router.</div>
