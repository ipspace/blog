      "html": "Thank you very much for all the insight you provide us with on every post. Yesterday I was studying ND and RA messages using GNS3 along with VirtualBox. I was using IOS 12.4 Advanced Enterprise and Windows 7 Enterprise. As soon as I configured the router&#39;s interface with ipv6 address 2001:db8:1111:1::/64 eui-64 and ipv6 enable, the router starts sending ND messages as well as RA messages, as verified by using debug ipv6 icmp and debug ipv6 nd.<br />The host receives one IPv6 address, using the prefix sent by the router and its EUI-64 portion. Why is this happening if I have not configured the sending of RA messages on the router yet? I have been reading the theory but it doesn&#39;t make much sense to me when compared to what I witness on the machines. Any guidance will be helpful.  ",

If you hard reload a router it may or may not fail over nicely.<br /><br />The worst failover time I saw was around 40 seconds, but I know much of that was ospf figuring out the new return path.  To properly test this I should set it up both with and without hsrp and see what the difference is.<br /><br />But in general it does seem to work.",
