It&#39;s a great solution. <br /><br />But it comes down to many factors such as time to deploy, cost, size of L2 domain, does this L2 domain even need an L3 gateway, traffic types, connectivity between sites, and the list can keep going. <br /> <br />My hope is OTV becomes available on the Cloud Services Router based on ASR 1K IOS XE.  Doubt it, but one can hope.<br /><br />I look forward to hearing some case studies soon regarding VXLAN intra or inter-DC ;)<br /><br />-Jason<br /><br />",

Please keep me in the loop.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Ivan",

      "html": "Ivan, thank you for the informative article.<br /><br />I would point out three advantages of VXLAN compared with OTV:<br /><br />   1. Multi-vendor support.  OTV is a single-vendor solution, and while an internet-draft has been published, it is actually incompatible with the N7k OTV implementation (a completely different encap).<br /><br />   2. Virtualize at the edge.  OTV pushes the 2-over-3 encap to the data center core (N7k), meaning there&#39;s a big layer 2 network within the DC, with all of the problems that brings (4k vlan limit, mac address table limitations, spanning tree, etc).  With VXLAN, there are cost-effective edge implementations that free you from all of these constraints (16M layer-2 domains, no worries about overflowing the MAC table in your core switches, taking advantage of L3 ECMP end-to-end, etc).<br /><br />   3. VMware interoperability.  VSphere 5.1 ships with VXLAN support in the hypervisor.  VXLAN is coming to Xen/KVM as well.<br /><br />Most of the limitations you describe will be addressed in the next year or so.  Due to its multi-vendor nature, VXLAN is the clear long-term solution (think ISL versus 802.1q).  So even if I were deploying today, I should think I would go VXLAN and bet on the roadmap rather than tie my network architecture to a single-vendor solution despite some short-term advantages.<br /><br />Kenneth Duda<br />CTO &amp; SVP Software<br />Arista Networks, Inc.<br />",

      "html": "I think Ivan&#39;s seminal premise prevails: VXLAN is not a DCI technology (not in its current form). <br /><br />VXLAN was designed originally to enable the creation of a large number of virtual segments in the vein of the virtual app that had virtual nodes, but no good virtual segment service. With that goal in mind, the group opted for an over simplistic approach to the creation of the VXLAN overlay. One that does not satisfy the DCI requirements, but has the potential to provide a large number of virtual segments to the orchestrator creating virtual apps. I say has the potential to deliver this, because none of the implementations out there today actually deliver this large number of segments. Standard or proprietary, it is what it is, not more not less, definitely not a DCI tool.<br /><br />Enhancing VXLAN to become a full fledged L2 VPN service is a potential future and once we are done adding the necessary enhancements, we will have indeed completed a similar engineering cycle to that which we went over in 2007 for OTV. In the mean time (while we re-invent the wheel), there is existing, matured, widely deployed and hardened technology that is designed with DCI requirements in mind and can be deployed today.<br /><br />Regarding the points Ken brings:<br /><br />Multi-vendor: The encapsulation currently in use is in place to satisfy a rapid market. Cisco has consistently volunteered its IP in the interest of fostering interoperability. A quick scan at the drafts will show that the encapsulation being used in VXLAN is borrowed from earlier OTV and LISP drafts and is indeed what we are standardizing on for IP overlays: LISP, OTV and VXLAN. This is the vision we&#39;ve had for a long time and we are glad that the industry is following. All that said, the encapsulation is the least interesting element in all of this. The meat is in the control plane and that is what is not defined in VXLAN as of today and I have not witnessed any open standards discussion on that front.<br /><br />Virtualize on the edge: The important item is not so much where the tunnel end-point resides, it is in how the overlay is realized. A flood based overlay like VXLAN pushed across data centers means any flood activity in any DC is seen everywhere (think ubiquitous arp storms). This negates to a large extent the resiliency benefits of having more than one facility. So creating an L3 network, just to overlay a flat virtual flood domain onto it, is not a healthy practice for the interconnection of DCs. I think this was clearly articulated by Ivan. If desired, the OTV edge functionality could be pushed to the access ports, but there are much better ways to design a data center fabric than to simply flatten it out.<br /><br />VMware interoperability: That is where we use VXLAN and why Cisco supports VXLAN extensively. Actually Cisco is the first vendor to have released VXLAN in shipping product and we have a solid committed roadmap for it. But that doesn&#39;t mean that the DCI functionality needs to be bundled into this portion of the orchestration, nor does it mean that everything you did in networking until now is obsoleted by the introduction of VXLAN. Each task has its right tool. VXLAN may be a nice hammer, but I am still not going to hammer in my screws.<br /><br />BTW. As of today, both VXLAN and OTV are simply individual contributions and not adopted by any WG at the IETF. So neither one is even remotely close to being a standard.",
