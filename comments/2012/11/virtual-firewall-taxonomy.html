            <div class="comment-content">And many of physical firewalls can be virtualized. So one physical firewall can have multiple virtual firewalls inside. They all have their own routing table, rule base and management interface.<br /><br />This is also another meaning for virtual firewalls.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I cannot comment on nevots affiliation, I am not involved with Palo Alto however. But I have seen colleagues using Palo Alto boxes (don&#39;t ask me which ones), and they can do pretty impressive stuff. As far as I understood, the boxes are L7 firewalls which do pattern matching on packet contents in hardware and virtually in line speed. They have rules for most protocols, eg. you can have rules that deny certain operations of the SMB protocol. <br /><br />So yes, I think Palo Alto is pretty interesting :). Since I only know the comments on Palo Alto by my colleagues, I am also interested in what you think about them.<br /><br />Btw the guy starting the company (Nir Zuk) started Netscreen before (now part of Juniper), AFAIK they did the first implementation of stateful packet inspection in hardware. I have worked with Netscreen boxes before, and I like them, so I am probably a little bit biased. <br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">FWIW: Nir Zuk started up OneSecure, which was acquired by Netscreen for their IPS technology in 2002. Netscreen&#39;s CTO at  startup was Ken Xie, who went on to start Fortinet after the Juniper deal. <br /><br />Both Juniper IPS and many parts of Fortinet seem similar to Netscreen of old. </div>

It may be great reading a post about them.<br /><br />Regards!</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Well we just did a PoC on a couple of PA-5050´s.<br /><br />They failed because.<br /><br />-No IPV6 hardware acceleration and broken IPV6 if over 50% CPU ( will get fixed in 5.0)<br /><br />-Very high cpu usage if you have alot of HTTP traffic.<br />We had about 65% cpu usage for 1 gbps of traffic.<br /><br />-Support didnt work. It took them over 5 weeks to identify a problem with Syn Cookies. Over 50% cpu and syn cookies enabled would result in packet drops.<br /><br />This is just the list with the major issues we had.<br />The Palo Alto platform is not wirespeed for sure. If somebody wants all the data please contact me.<br /><br /><br />So right now we are running FortiNET 3950B in a PoC with 3 XH0 Securti engiens.<br /><br />FortiNET actually do alot of IPS in ASICS or FPGA.<br /><br />We are only seeing 6% CPU with the same amount of traffic.<br /><br /><br />The Palo Alto gui feels very modern compared to the FortiNET but the engineering is not very solid compared to FortiNET.<br /><br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;m amazed at all the limpy, barely-there virtual security products that try to pass for firewalls -- e.g., vShield Edge, vShield App, and Cisco&#39;s VSG. These are are glorified L2/L3/L4 packet filters, barely able to tell an ARP from an NDP and with a &quot;kitschy UI in front of Linux iptables&quot; (thanks Ivan!). Consider their Application layer gateway (ALG) support:<br /><br />  vShield Edge: FTP<br />  vShield App: FTP, Microsoft RPC, Linux RPC, Sun RPC, Oracle TNS<br />  Cisco VSG: FTP, RSH, and TFTP<br /><br />Shouldn&#39;t intra-tenant security have more protocol awareness than a perimeter firewall? E.g., infrastructure protocols (NFS, CIFS/SMB, DNS, LDAP, MS RPC with UUID discrimination), application protocols (HTTP, Oracle, SIP, SMTP, RTSP), and the app data (SQL, SOAP, XML). Now, this veers dangerously into WAF and IPS territory but, IMHO, what&#39;s the point of doing intra-tenant security without understanding the apps?<br /><br />vShield App might have a nice GUI, but it&#39;s actual security protection is no better than L4 ACL&#39;s on the free Nexus 1000v combined with the firewall built-in to every modern OS. If it was my security budget, I&#39;d start with that, add a solid perimeter firewall, and then throw every remaining dollar at badass IPS and WAF vendors -- SourceFire, Imperva, TippingPoint, etc.<br /></div>
