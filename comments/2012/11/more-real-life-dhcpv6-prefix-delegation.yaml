  html: But what do you do for CPE which doesn&#39;t do / support PD? if they don&#39;t
    ask  then they never get a site prefix routed to them?

    html: You have to specify that with the lifetime in the DHCP pool.

    html: If I understand it correctly the problem is not the BRAS pool its the CPE.<br
      />After PD subnet change the CPE should send RA on it LAN with lifetime 0 for
      the old prefix and send RA with non-zero lifetime for the new prefix.<br />See
      L-13 in http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-v6ops-6204bis-08<br />I hope they
      will do it correctly or we will have a lot of problems.<br /><br />Nitzan<br

    html: You&#39;re absolutely right - the problem is CPE&#39;s inability to clear
      delegated prefix after PPPoE session fails.<br /><br />As for 6204bis - hope
      springs eternal, but the historical data points in vendor reality indicate otherwise.

  html: The missing part is how fast the clients will replace their global IP address
    in case the user will connect to a different BRAS.<br /><br />Nitzan

  html: "I was unaware that the delegated prefix was assumed to be static in theory...\
    \ <br /><br />My own provider also gives me the same delegated prefix (through\
    \ AAA) but without any guarantee as my BRAS could change if they need to redesign\
    \ their network.<br /><br />And for having worked on DHCP-PD on low cost CPE code,\
    \ this is indeed tricky because all low cost CPE (or at least most) rely on Linux\
    \ and there is little interconnection between the several buggy DHCPv6 clients\
    \ and RADVD or quagga or ...<br /><br />-\xE9ric<br /><br />PS: thanks for your\
    \ post as usual :-)"
