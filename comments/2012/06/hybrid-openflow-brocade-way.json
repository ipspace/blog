      "html": "Ivan, <br />You mentioned this is similar to what Juniper is doing w/ integrated OpenFlow.  I read through both articles and they do seem to be pretty much the same. Which leads me to my question.<br /><br />How do they actually differ?  Is the Brocade switch one or the other but not both modes at the same time?  I see Juniper gives OF a route preference but it appears Brocade look into the OF FIB first-much like a default route or match, then regular processing.  <br /><br />Thanks for the great articles!",
