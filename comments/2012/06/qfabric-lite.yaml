  html: Is it still 4K VLANs (or 4 x times that in a &quot;partitioned&quot; mode)?

    html: As with any data center solution, once it grows beyond the maximum capacity,
      you&#39;ll be engaged in heavy rewiring exercise. <br /><br />I&#39;m positive
      every single one of your (or mine) designs has the same problem, although the
      maximum limits could be higher or lower.

    html: Adding new switches and rewiring? Yes, that&#39;s understandable.  Ripping
      out and re-purchasing your Interconnect? No, not every design has that problem.

    html: In the end, it all depends on what&#39;s cheaper and how much downtime costs
      you. It might be cheaper (from the opportunity cost/loss-of-revenue perspective)
      to replace the interconnect than to rewire the network core.

    html: In a standard Leaf/Spine design, you can add Spine switches and rewire the
      Leafs with no hard downtime.  Done right, it would be a 50% capacity reduction
      during the rewiring -- which may not be a big deal.<br /><br />On the other
      hand, when upgrading from QFabric Lite to QFabric, hard downtime seems to be
      the only option.

    html: Now imagine going from a leaf/spine design to a 3-stage Clos fabric as the
      spine (that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing when going from QFX3600-I to QFX3008).
      Yeah, you can rewire that with no hard downtime, but it would be an interesting
      exercise.

  html: And with the standard Leaf/Spine design, using today&#39;s hardware, you don&#39;t
    need to make that leap to 3-stage until you&#39;ve reached well over 6000 ports
    (6144 to be exact).  Plenty of room for most data centers.  The QFLite 768 port
    ceiling is a bit too low, IMHO ;)
