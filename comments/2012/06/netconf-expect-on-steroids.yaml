    html: Let me know when the abstractions don&#39;t suck...

    html: 'Hi Brad,<br />I agree with you in that Quantum is headed in the right direction
      architecturally. Specifically, the ability of plugins to define extension APIs
      is analogous to the enterprise private MIBs we all know and love for pre-standards
      or proprietary functionality. <br /><br />However, the currently defined &#39;core&#39;
      APIs don&#39;t really allow granular access to the configurables on individual
      devices, the whole point being that the consumers of the NB API shouldn&#39;t
      have to twiddle bits in order to accomplish a provisioning task. So while Quantum
      is likely to evolve into a great abstraction layer for orchestration and compound
      provisioning operations, I don&#39;t really see it being terribly useful to
      CLI junkies and power users in the way that Expect scripting and Netconf (with
      direct mappings to device CLI/SNMP variables) can be.<br /><br />To my knowledge,
      I also don&#39;t know of anyone using Quantum outside of the Openstack (Nova
      Compute as the driver of the NB API) ecosystem. This is likely because Quantum
      is still young and not quite ready to go out on its own; worth keeping an eye
      on for sure.<br /><br />(Disclaimer: I work for a vendor that enthusiastically
      backs Openstack)'

    html: Sarwar,<br /><br />A vendor specific &quot;plugins&quot; for Quantum can
      expose additional vendor specific features and functionality not currently in
      the &#39;core&#39; API.  If those feature prove useful and commonly required,
      they can at some point be rolled into the &#39;core&#39; Quantum API.<br /><br
      />Topics such as NETCONF and OpenFlow are usually relevant in discussions about
      orchestration and network automation.  The needs of the human CLI junky has
      little relevance in automation.  In troubleshooting, the human CLI junky will
      likely bypass and ignore any abstraction layers anyway and just CLI straight
      to the vendor switch device.

  html: Ivan,<br />I think the answer to this conundrum is already taking shape in
    the form of OpenStack Quantum.  A network configuration abstraction layer.  What
    you standardize on is a north bound API, and you let vendors provide their specific
    &quot;plugins&quot; for carrying out the southbound operations - which could be
    NETCONF, OpenFlow, expect scripts, whatever.

    html: I agree NETCONF is way better than Expect (didn&#39;t I just say that?),
      but at the moment it&#39;s still CLI wrapped in XML sugarcoating. Agreed?<br
      /><br />I mentioned SNMP solely because it has the third component (standard
      MIBs).

    html: I guess you could say that at a high-level.  Digging in the details a bit,
      though, shows that in JUNOScript everything is XML-ized in the response. Every
      bit of information is enclosed in its own tags.  In IOS, this is not always
      true.  For some commands, the IOS router just takes the output of the CLI command
      and encapsulates the whole thing into a single set of tags.  You still have
      to screw around with parsing (regex, etc) in your script.

  html: I think the analogy both with expect and with SNMP is flawed.  I&#39;ve written
    a number of scripts that utilize NetConf and it is far easier (and more reliable)
    to use than either SNMP or Expect.<br /><br />But you&#39;re right, there needs
    to be something like NETMOD.

  html: '...and I&#39;d also add that JUNOS (as seen through it&#39;s CLI and NETCONF)
    is data-centric (few verbs, much data) while the various versions of IOS are command-centric
    (many verbs, little data).<br /><br />This made it much easier to add NETCONF
    to JUNOS than IOS* since much transformation needs to be done.<br /><br />I&#39;ll
    say it again. The current (*hint*) NETCONF implementation in the IOS:es is unfortunately
    a major hurdle for NETCONF adoption and should be avoided for now.'
