      "html": "Your comment about debugging in a world driven by ephemeral state is absolutely true. It will be interesting to see how we provide tactile feedback to network operators who are managing networks where they are not the only ones modifying network behavior. This is not that different from having two people driving a car. It works as long as both people want to go the same direction, but it can be difficult to diagnose the source of issues when you have multiple sources of input.",

      "html": "I somehow prefer the netconf approach. As written it is purely for configuration. Then that configuration will influence the control plane and thus the data plane. The nodes will run the protocols they run and each one will be pretty autonomus in its routing and forwarding decesions.  <br /><br />SDN and openflow controllers reminds me to the glory days telephony and SS7 switches. <br />We all know what happens with the gateways when the ss7 switch goes down. The same architecture is pushed by the openflow paradigm. Thus I beleive that SDN conflicts with some of the basic distributed packet network principles defined by people like  Paul Baran.",
