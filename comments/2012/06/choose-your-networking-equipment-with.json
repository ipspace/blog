Always look twice and always evaluate and test the equipment you have or will buy.<br /><br />In my current project there was a pair of Cat 6500 using VSS. Sure they support IPv6 just fine. But there was a IPv6 related Bug which lead reboots. :-(<br /><br />And I guess there is still no current IOS that supports (routed) IPv6 over WLAN on my old Cisco 871w (there was at least one but someone from Cisco told me it was a bug that IPv6 was working on the wireless interface). <br /><br />So you&#39;ll also have to look for the small things like monitoring (different counters for IPv4/IPv6, BGP via SNMP), RA Guard, ....",
