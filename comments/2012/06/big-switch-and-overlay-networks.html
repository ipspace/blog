            <div class="comment-content">Ivan, I&#39;m not sure I see this the same way you do. To me it seems pretty tactical and doesn&#39;t indicate anything in the way of a change in direction.  I see it more as a specific use case of the more general problem they&#39;re trying to address.<br /><br />They&#39;ve got an OpenFlow controller. OVS supports OpenFlow. Virtual (compute) environments like this are relatively isolated and independent so, by comparison, much simpler to deploy (i.e. no h/w open flow devices). That combined with the well known pain that goes along with networking virtualized environments, this seems like a no brainer.</div>
