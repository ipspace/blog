            <div class="comment-content">Hey Ivan, when referring to HP still having a &quot;remarkably good offering in this space&quot; - are you talking about IMC (from the H3C acquisition), or NNM+related products (i.e. the current iteration of what started out as Openview) ?<br /><br />Just wondering, it wasn&#39;t clear to me from the link you gave there. Wasn&#39;t sure if they showed you IMC at the Net FieldDay or not.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">IMC is an interesting product. I&#39;ve been doing a bit of work with it recently. There&#39;s a lot to like about it, but there&#39;s still quite a few rough edges. What I do like is the extensibility. Right now a lot of the device management stuff is just TCL/expect under the hood, but it&#39;s a framework, and I would expect you could easily change that to use something like NETCONF. <br /><br />Would be nice if they would get around to releasing the list of supported devices - it&#39;s not publicly available currently. Hopefully later this year. Right now, you have to try it out, and fix up the expect scripts yourself. That&#39;s part of what I&#39;ve been doing the last week, trying to get ASA configs managed by IMC. As I said though, it&#39;s extensible, and there&#39;s nothing stopping you going and making those changes yourself. Makes a pleasant change to some other products I&#39;ve been using, where you need to wait for a patch to support a new device.</div>
