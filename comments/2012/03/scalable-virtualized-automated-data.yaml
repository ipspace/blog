  html: VCD does all of that and doesnt care about your switched network assuming
    you have a VDS or 1KV.<br /><br />The automated Data Center = auto-provisioning
    VMs (building standard Linux/Windows servers or clients)using a template pre-built
    VM that will be copied  - within a number of pre-assigned layer2 clouds that live
    behind a virtual edge firewall that have IP4 routes (large ones /23 to /21) from
    your core already defined.  Autoprovisioning also autoprovisions IP addresses
    for these servers as well as &#39;pre-defined&#39; firewall rules on the edge
    device as well as on the servers&#39; nics.<br /><br />This lets the Windows or
    Linux group quickly spin up a machine for a customer to use.  The Windows guys
    cant spend six days(for some reason) building a server anymore.<br /><br />I dont
    feel this takes away much from the network group. Firewall rules still need to
    be customized for any deployment, the routes for the server or VDI address space
    still had to be defined, TOR switches will always be around and need to be installed,
    address space will need to be provided and installed, troubleshooting will always
    end with the NE.  Essentially the storage and network engineer are still doing
    exactly what they were before except for assigning IPs to individual servers (not
    sure i agree with this) and not assigning LUNS to servers (not sure i agree with
    this either).<br /><br />Most of the work is taken away from the server &#39;build&#39;
    group.  Of course they are harping that they still need  5 days to patch as the
    copied image cant keep up with Linux and MS&#39; monthly patching cycle.

  html: VCD will be a very interesting solution for server (not so much VDI) deployment
    once it matures. Have you taken a close look at vShield Edge functionality?
