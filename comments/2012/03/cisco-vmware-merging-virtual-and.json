      "html": "Yes, no and maybe...  <br /><br />A VM-FEX virtual Ethernet interface can be configured as a SPAN source and destination just like a physical interface can, but the 5Ks and FIs have limitations on SPAN, and depending on the SPAN requirements this could cause a problem.  With 1000v, a VSM supports 64 SPAN/ERSPAN sessions across all installed VEMs.  You can send this traffic to the physical network or keep it &quot;virtual&quot; by using a virtual traffic analyzer such as the NAM virtual service blade on the Nexus 1010 &quot;appliance&quot;.  <br /><br />As for Netflow, the 5Ks and FIs don&#39;t support it, so Netflow requirements are another use-case for 1000v.  <br /><br />QoS on 5Ks and FIs don&#39;t support matching/marking L3 DSCP values because they are L2 switches.  When L3 capability is added (available now for 55XX, soon for 62XX) DSCP matching/marking is possible.  I learned this when prepping UCS for a Unified Communications install.  The UC applications mark traffic with DSCP values, and Cisco recommends  honoring those values at L2 by translating them to CoS using 1000v.  <br /><br />I am not 100% certain but I am pretty sure when I was looking at this for UCS a few months back they are the same VEM.  To verify I&#39;ll download the latest releases for 1000v and VM-FEX and see how they compare.",
