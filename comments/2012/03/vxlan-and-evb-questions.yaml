  html: 'You&#39;ve answered a question I couldn&#39;t find an answer for: connection
    over VXLAN to a gateway. Using a VM with two vNICs for bridging to traditional
    VLAN access, or using it as the gateway itself also implies that you have to design
    with an extra layer of complexity in mind: ineffective briding is easily introduced
    on existing infrastructure, because data flows from one VM to the next, and most
    likely back into a layer 2 fabric towards destinations. That may cause increased
    bandwidth too.<br /><br />All in all it doesn&#39;t seem to be a stable and working
    concept for me right now, except in the niche cases you&#39;ve mentioned (virtual
    firewalls).'

  html: 'Ivan,<br /><br />There seem to be more problems than just TCP offload -<br
    /><br />1.  # of multicast groups in the physical network.   The # of vxlans you
    support increases the scale requirement of # of multicast groups your networking
    gear needs to support.<br /><br />2.  When you are using multicast the convergence
    of vm movement is still a function of your physical <br />    network convergance.<br
    /><br />3.  Secure group joins and PimBidir support in majority of the networking
    gear today<br /><br />     This I think the security part will be swept under
    the carpet till it becomes a real issue.  PimBiDir<br />     support will become
    common only if vxlan catches up.<br /><br />4.  TCP offload details<br /><br />     Each
    of these features which save the CPU cycles are gone or you need a new NIC -<br
    /><br />     a.  LSO, LRO<br />     b.  IP Checksum, UDP Checksum, TCP Checksum
    - both generation and testing<br />          Again this will be swept under the
    carpet is my guess.<br />     c.  Path MTU<br />          This probably will be
    dealt with pre-configuring the MTU in guest VMs and will be swept under<br />          the
    carpet.<br /><br />5.   VxLAN still aspires to provide multiple VLAN like constructs
    to the guest VMs running on multiple<br />      servers.<br />      The details
    of how network is simulated, what networking protocols required to be supported<br
    />      is left open to interpretation.<br /><br />6.   This one has been addressed
    now by Embrane but there was a lack of load balancers, firewalls<br />      which
    need to go along with the vxlan solution.  IPSec gateway is another example.  However
    I <br />      think these are opportunities if market really catches this trend.<br
    /><br />The VDP based solution avoids most of these issues.   So I am not sure
    why someone wants to use<br />vxLAN on their already deployed data center which
    will result in a low performance and throughput.<br /><br />I see that STT avoids
    some of the TCP offload issues, but it seems like a clever hack.   NVGRE avoids<br
    />reliance on multicast in the network but still has the same problems of TCP
    offload.<br /><br />I think without a NIC which supports VxLAN (Cisco sure will
    do this to differentiate their servers and<br />disrupt the market) moving to
    VxLAN will be a disaster for customers.<br /><br />Again opinionated, but would
    like to know your thoughts on each of these...<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Suhas'

  html: Great post Ivan helped me clear up some questions I had in my head and great
    questions Wim. If you could do some more posts like this where you contrast the
    different technologies and standards that would be great.

  html: Nice article.  Thanks, Ivan.<br /><br />Keep in mind that VXLAN can be implemented
    in physical switches.  This way, you can continue to use your paravirtualized
    TCP-offload NIC, and still get the scalability benefits of VXLAN.<br /><br />VXLAN
    improves scalability in several ways.  It gets you past the 4k vlan limit, and
    also avoids scaling limits in core MAC tables, provides a multi-path fabric, avoids
    spanning tree, and reduces the scope of broadcasts.<br /><br />Finally, to route
    out of a VXLAN segment, you can either go through a multi-VNIC guest (as identified
    in the article), or, your friendly neighborhood top-of-rack switch can serve as
    the default gateway for a VXLAN and route unencapsulated traffic up and out, for
    extremely high performance.  Of course, if you need FW/LB/NAT, then your friendly
    neighborhood top-of-rack switch might need an L4-7 education.<br /><br />    -Ken<br

  html: Thanks for the feedback, Ken!<br /><br />Am I right in understanding that
    your &quot;VXLAN in physical switches helps you retain TCP offload&quot; statement
    refers to a design where the hypervisor hosts would use VLANs and the VXLAN encapsulation
    would be done in the switches? That&#39;s definitely an interesting proposal,
    but faces the same &quot;lack of control plane&quot; problems as any other non-EVB
    proposal.<br /><br />And I&#39;m anxiously waiting for a public announcement of
    VXLAN support in physical switches  8-)<br /><br />Ivan

  html: It seems a lot of these so called &quot;new&quot; schemes are invented by
    people who don&#39;t really have in depth knoweldge of networking, see some problems
    and immediately come up with  solutions and call them revolutionary, when in fact
    they are not well thought out, convoluted and complex. The sad thing is that the
    rest of the crowd worship them. VXLAN RFC did a good job on describing the problem
    space, but the solution proposed so short of expectation, a total let down. It
    is along the line of continue to extend the VLANs even though it recognized that
    the underneath infrastructure has to be IP. VLAN was not a good technology to
    begin with, it was a simple minded layer 2 folks&#39; solution to solve broadcast
    storms. Now they are still twisting arms and legs to continue that path.

    html: Thank you. I know - I was so pleasantly surprised when doing research for
      the Data Center Fabrics Update webinar. Time to write a blog post ...
