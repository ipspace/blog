      "html": "What if you used a trunk to the TOR switch and applied a VPLS xconnect to a sub-interface? You&#39;d be limited to 4095 guests per server, but I think there are some other limiting factors in that case. That way you could put different servers in VPLS groups based on VLAN assignment by the vSwitch, but the TOR switch applies the labels and creates the LSPs for the entire rack.  <br /> <br />The only way BGP convergence would hurt you is if you&#39;re using a true MPLS VPN where routes are actually redistributed into BGP for each VRF. If you&#39;re using VPLS then LDP will just distribute the corresponding labels to their destination and BGP isn&#39;t required.  <br /> <br />Just a thought. Not sure how well it would scale.",

It would require tight coupling between hypervisors and ToR switches and although there are solutions along those lines, none of them is easily adaptable to new topologies.<br /><br />On the other hand, MPLS scaling would be an order of magnitude easier to achieve (as you need LSP per ToR switch, not per hypervisor host), but you&#39;d still be without a control plane and rely on flooding to figure out where the VMs are.",
