      "html": "This is absolutely correct.<br /><br />I think also because it is now easier more then ever for quite young people to be &quot;in the know&quot; with IT. Schools these days? Laptops and ipads. <br /><br />Those curious enough will go on google and look at servers and what they do, download timebombed microsoft software and muck around. Then (think)they are now a &quot;server expert&quot; at the age of 16.<br /><br />I think also the fact that alot of people doing the interviewing for SMB companies, for the IT jobs, have no idea about IT themselves. This makes it quite easy to say &quot;I know windows real good&quot; without actually knowing anything about windows. They then land a job at a small ad-hoc IT company looking after SMB(&quot;sysadmin&quot; or &quot;systems engineer&quot;), and its the exact scenario you listed above.<br /><br />The market is flooded with these kinds of people. The reason IT has one of the stereotypes it has.<br /><br />note: I am not saying this is a bad thing, or good thing, good and bad are matter of opinion and situation.",

      "html": "Some observations follow.<br /><br />There are people who find joy in tinkering with technologies. They are called geeks today, nerds yesterday and when I was in high school, loosers (yes, I am a looser).  They are not large in number.  They spend a good deal of time tinkering (with the associated deep learning). If the technology is new, this is fine as there is little demand to deploy it in the market, so no time pressure to &quot;just deploy it&quot;. <br /><br />One implication of a &quot;mature technology&quot; is the adoption rate is growing rapidly. Time to deploy for the newest admins approaches &quot;zero&quot;. Thus, the time available to tinker and learn for the newest admins also approaches zero. That said, if they installed it and its running, who among them would call themselves &quot;novies&quot; about the technology? <br /><br />I&#39;m in a technical class this week. We all  introduced ourselves. 50% of the attendees &quot;suddenly&quot; became responsible for this technology and inherited the design and deployment of the previous admin. They have very little time to dig deep because they still have their original responsibilities along with the new technology. There is so much time in the day.<br /><br />Those in IT who have the time to dig deep are most fortunate indeed.",
