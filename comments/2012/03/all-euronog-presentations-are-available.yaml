  html: Thx for share it.<br />Btw today session at plnog was excellent! It was nice
    to hear a different (far away from marketing mumble) point of view about cloud
    networking. I hope you&#39;ll also share a presentation from this session.<br
    />Best Regards

  html: I would like also to have a look at that presentation. Unfortunately with
    four different tracks at PLNOG it is hard to attend them all at the same time
    ;)
