         "html": "What I love about the STT approach and the whole business model of the truly software SDN startups, is being agnostic to the hardware underneath. Abstraction will allow for commoditization of the lower ends of the stack. TOE is on every NIC out there. Very elegant solution for what I hope is a short term problem but am starting to think tunnels will be all that is left someday. Build a tunnel to gmail to check my mail etc.<br /><br />I just hope I will see a crumb of the magical creatures from fantasy land over the next 20 years  :)<br /><br />Great post as always Ivan!<br /><br />https://twitter.com/#!/CCIE11972",

Does Nic has the intel to fill the required fields in the stt frame header(meta data as well as the tcp like header.)",
