      "html": "VCD does all of that and doesnt care about your switched network assuming you have a VDS or 1KV.<br /><br />The automated Data Center = auto-provisioning VMs (building standard Linux/Windows servers or clients)using a template pre-built VM that will be copied  - within a number of pre-assigned layer2 clouds that live behind a virtual edge firewall that have IP4 routes (large ones /23 to /21) from your core already defined.  Autoprovisioning also autoprovisions IP addresses for these servers as well as &#39;pre-defined&#39; firewall rules on the edge device as well as on the servers&#39; nics.<br /><br />This lets the Windows or Linux group quickly spin up a machine for a customer to use.  The Windows guys cant spend six days(for some reason) building a server anymore.<br /><br />I dont feel this takes away much from the network group. Firewall rules still need to be customized for any deployment, the routes for the server or VDI address space still had to be defined, TOR switches will always be around and need to be installed, address space will need to be provided and installed, troubleshooting will always end with the NE.  Essentially the storage and network engineer are still doing exactly what they were before except for assigning IPs to individual servers (not sure i agree with this) and not assigning LUNS to servers (not sure i agree with this either).<br /><br />Most of the work is taken away from the server &#39;build&#39; group.  Of course they are harping that they still need  5 days to patch as the copied image cant keep up with Linux and MS&#39; monthly patching cycle.",
