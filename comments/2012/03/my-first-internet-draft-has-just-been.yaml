  html: Just a small idea. Would you think it wise, to have the document written only
    for IPv6, without referring to IPv4 practices as they must be covered in another
    document?

  html: First of all congratulations. <br />In secion 4.1.1.1. RFC3330 is mentioned,
    which was published in 2002, but there is  RFC 5735  published in 2010, with additional
    not routable prefixes.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Quite interesting, and nice to put this in writing. The
    max /24 prefix length on IPv4 will probably not keep on being &quot;best practice&quot;,
    when we get closer top IPv4 Exhaustion.<br /><br />Extending the scope, could
    be to describe some security &quot;best practices&quot;, when using BGP Inter-AS
    option B and C, and maybe CSC.

  html: Great work, Ivan!<br />However, I slightly disagree with the filtering of
    Exchange points LAN prefixes. Blocking these prefixes in combination with unicast
    reverse path forwarding check might lead to dropping some valuable ICMP, like
    3/4 (Frag.needed), and break the PMTU discovery. I agree that is not very likely
    to happen, but it could be an issue.

  html: You seem to be advocating bogon filtering for IPv6 in section 4.1.2.1. I have
    to disagree with the notion that it&#39;s somehow a &quot;best practice&quot;.
    Bogon filters do not protect from any serious threat but cause lots and lots connectivity
    issues when a new prefix becomes allocated.<br /><br />It never worked right for
    IPv4, why would it work for IPv6?
