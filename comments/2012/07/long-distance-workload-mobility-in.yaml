    html: I would only presume that the first hop/default gateway was using HSRP localization.
      This basically allows you to have your gateway IP addres exist at both sites
      even though they&#39;re in the same stretched broadcast domain. I can&#39;t
      speak for load balancers, NAS devices or other application dependencies that
      can&#39;t be usually just be vmotioned.

  html: So, 25 mile long virtual Ethernet cables to move &quot;processing and storage&quot;
    to the second datacenter.  OTV used to extend the subnets to the second datacenter,
    meaning that traffic is still gatewaying through the first datacenter.  The VMs
    are thus tethered to the first datacenter and now network failure of either datacenter
    will cause application disruption.  This also causes traffic tromboning because
    traffic would have to flow through the first datacenter in order to pass between
    the Presentation, Application, and Database tiers of the application thus loading
    up the Metro Ethernet link and introducing latency between the tiers which would
    likely negatively impact application performance.<br /><br />This is only a tool.  It
    is not a solution.  Until such time as we re-home the VMs to the second datacenter
    using LISP or automating the re-IPing and firewall policies and such that the
    traffic gateways through the second datacenter, this long distance VMotion is
    of little use.

    html: There definitely should be one, and the competition would be fierce ;) Anyhow,
      these guys deserved it.

  html: Hang on just a second there, Ivan... There&#39;s an exaggeration-of-the-month
    award?
