This basically allows you to have your gateway IP addres exist at both sites even though they&#39;re in the same stretched broadcast domain. I can&#39;t speak for load balancers, NAS devices or other application dependencies that can&#39;t be usually just be vmotioned.",

      "html": "So, 25 mile long virtual Ethernet cables to move &quot;processing and storage&quot; to the second datacenter.  OTV used to extend the subnets to the second datacenter, meaning that traffic is still gatewaying through the first datacenter.  The VMs are thus tethered to the first datacenter and now network failure of either datacenter will cause application disruption.  This also causes traffic tromboning because traffic would have to flow through the first datacenter in order to pass between the Presentation, Application, and Database tiers of the application thus loading up the Metro Ethernet link and introducing latency between the tiers which would likely negatively impact application performance.<br /><br />This is only a tool.  It is not a solution.  Until such time as we re-home the VMs to the second datacenter using LISP or automating the re-IPing and firewall policies and such that the traffic gateways through the second datacenter, this long distance VMotion is of little use.",
