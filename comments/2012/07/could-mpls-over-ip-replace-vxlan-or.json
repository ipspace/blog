However, it will also require the VMkernel to run BGP. I think even PBB-VPLS would be a viable option. We are running PBB-VPLS in a service provider environment.",

Once multicast is supported, there is no reason why L2-over-IP could not be leveraged.  It natively uses IP-over-IP (UDP), and has the control-plane to scale (analogous to DNS).  An interesting topic for sure as LISP evolves.",

For OTV specifically this goal is to take Ethernet frames from an end station, like a virtual machine, encapsulate them inside IPv4, transport them over the Data Center Interconnect (DCI) network, decapsulate them on the other side, and out pops your original Ethernet frame.&quot;",
