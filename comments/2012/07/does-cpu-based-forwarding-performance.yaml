  html: One of the biggest problem with x86 based appliances is called &quot;interface
    affinity&quot;, which means that each interface is mapped to one CPU receiving
    the interrupt.<br /><br />So if you have 16 core CPU and only one 10G interface,
    all the interrupts for that interfaces are handled by one core only.<br /><br
    />So be careful when doing a network design for a x86 only appliance.

  html: Dan, you should take care about Intel DPDK. Thanks to its Poll Mode Driver
    (PMD), you don&#39;t need anymore to use interrupts and you are fully unlocked
    and able to scale up to 160Mpps (packet per second) with the latest Intel CPUs.
