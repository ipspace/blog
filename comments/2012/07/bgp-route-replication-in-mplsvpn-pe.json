Updated the blog post.<br /><br />BTW, per-PE-per-VRF RDs won&#39;t cause a memory hit on route reflectors (they have to store all prefixes anyway, unless you use a RR hierarchy), but on the PE-routers, where the BGP memory consumption will probably increase by around 80%.",

         "html": "If you plan to ever support multipath load sharing or fast failover for your customers networks, the per-PE-per-VRF unique RD approach, usually in the formation ipv4.loop.back.address:vpnid, will be very important. It also aids in the identification of prefix origin during troubleshoots of large complex networks with tiered hierarchical design.<br /><br />The ability to ensure that multiple or alternate paths via different originating PE&#39;s in the same VPN are made available to the far end PE is beneficial enough to outweigh the need for additional memory. Its not as if we cant always add hundreds of gigs of ram to route reflectors, the biggest limitation in most modern carrier networks is the size of the average devices hardware forwarding table (TCAM in most devices)",

         "html": "Hi, <br /><br />One thing is not clear to me regarding actual import of route from BGP VPNv4 RIB to VRF RIB. If RT import statement is removed from VRF config than we can not see any more particular route in VRF RIB ant that is clear, because there is no matching RT inside of VRF and we can not import VPNv4 route. But in my simulation when RT import is removed from config also i cant see that same route in BGP VPNv4 RIB. Why? Is this VPNv4 route rejected by BGP VPNv4 as well? I tought that VPNv4 route is maintained in BGP VPNv4 RIB and after RT import is applied then moves to VRF RIB, but it looks aparently that BGP VPNv4 table is discarding this route without RT as well?!<br /><br />Thanks for comments<br />",
