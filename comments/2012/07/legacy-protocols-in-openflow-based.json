Wifi has killed the need for Ethernet, and in the near future every residential home is going to be powered by wireless wifi Clear 4G technology so there goes the need for a router, switch, Ethernet, fiber, etc... Everything is going wireless, and without need for wire, there is no need for router, switch, networking as we now it is dead. Everybody will be on cellphone, tablet, Wifi, 4G, 5G.... and everything will be cloud based SAAS.... no need for file servers, print servers, email servers.... all computers become dummy terminals and the real data centers will use OpenFlow.... where does that level the average networking tech? To find a job being a toll booth operator? Oh wait...",

      "html": "Thanks Ivan. I had been delinquent on digging into the XenServ vSwitch controller. I think you touch on a very important point that folks seem to be trying to develop answers for.  Blending the data center hypervisor network pools with the physical substrate into orchestration. The outstanding question I reckon is, do we need to further abstract the substrate? I have trouble picturing the network like a utility do to it&#39;s complexion. Maybe if that complexity is further abstracted into software than we are left with simple routed networks.<br />I have no idea what the hell I just said.<br />Your SDN vendor summaries have been really helpful. I used your Brocade SDN post from a few weeks ago just this week. Their protected and unprotected modes are really cool, but I got 10x clarity from your post then scouring their documentation. http://goo.gl/2UD7k",

That&#39;s why our product, MidoNet, supports BGP, including multihoming and ECMP, for interfacing MidoNet virtual routers with external L3 networks.  We don&#39;t yet support STP or LACP for interfacing MidoNet virtual bridges with external L2 networks, because we haven&#39;t seen the customer demand but it&#39;s something that we can definitely reconsider if the market requires it.",

      "html": "Well, if you have a OpenFlow Network with a controller, the controller will have the whole network topology.<br /><br />With that, you don&#39;t need STP... The controller will make an openflow path end-to-end. Don&#39;t need STP to control loops. And instead of getting 1 link down and 1 up(non-vlan STP), you&#39;ll get full bandwidth for as many uplinks as possible. Your controller is supposed to create unique paths that don&#39;t cause loop.<br /><br />LACP you could replace the same way, the controller will known the state of each link and if one path gets down, it will check the network topology and trace another path. For now, active passive should be possible without putting something on the edge.<br /><br />And don&#39;t worry, since it&#39;s *open* if you don&#39;t make one, somebody will and eventually will became opensource for everybody use... Comercial ones will come as well.<br /><br />Solutions for everybody tastes...<br /><br /><br />Anyways, this is something coming to the masses this year... Let&#39;s see how it goes =)",
