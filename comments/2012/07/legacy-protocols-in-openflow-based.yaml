    html: I just got CCNP certified and I&#39;m worried. Like Google said, the desktop
      is dead and tablet is king. Wifi has killed the need for Ethernet, and in the
      near future every residential home is going to be powered by wireless wifi Clear
      4G technology so there goes the need for a router, switch, Ethernet, fiber,
      etc... Everything is going wireless, and without need for wire, there is no
      need for router, switch, networking as we now it is dead. Everybody will be
      on cellphone, tablet, Wifi, 4G, 5G.... and everything will be cloud based SAAS....
      no need for file servers, print servers, email servers.... all computers become
      dummy terminals and the real data centers will use OpenFlow.... where does that
      level the average networking tech? To find a job being a toll booth operator?
      Oh wait...

  html: I would expect OpenFlow network to appear to other networks as a one big bridge
    and one big router.

    html: 'You&#39;re pretty spot-on. However, I think we should start with &quot;why
      is the network so complex&quot;; probably most of the complexity comes from
      our increadible masochistic urge to be McGyver and fix everyone else&#39;s blunders
      (see also: long-distance vMotion and Network Load Balancing :D )'

  html: Thanks Ivan. I had been delinquent on digging into the XenServ vSwitch controller.
    I think you touch on a very important point that folks seem to be trying to develop
    answers for.  Blending the data center hypervisor network pools with the physical
    substrate into orchestration. The outstanding question I reckon is, do we need
    to further abstract the substrate? I have trouble picturing the network like a
    utility do to it&#39;s complexion. Maybe if that complexity is further abstracted
    into software than we are left with simple routed networks.<br />I have no idea
    what the hell I just said.<br />Your SDN vendor summaries have been really helpful.
    I used your Brocade SDN post from a few weeks ago just this week. Their protected
    and unprotected modes are really cool, but I got 10x clarity from your post then
    scouring their documentation. http://goo.gl/2UD7k

  html: Great blog post, Ivan. We, at Midokura, have been thinking along these lines
    since we started building our overlay solution in 2010. That&#39;s why our product,
    MidoNet, supports BGP, including multihoming and ECMP, for interfacing MidoNet
    virtual routers with external L3 networks.  We don&#39;t yet support STP or LACP
    for interfacing MidoNet virtual bridges with external L2 networks, because we
    haven&#39;t seen the customer demand but it&#39;s something that we can definitely
    reconsider if the market requires it.

    html: You&#39;re absolutely right ... assuming you believe a single OpenFlow-controlled
      fabric will be all you&#39;ll ever have in your network. I&#39;m too old for
      such an optimistic view of the world.<br /><br />As for &quot;it&#39;s open&quot;
      - it&#39;s nice to be a believer, but I&#39;ve been disappointed by the open
      parts I&#39;ve seen so far (not to mention that OpenFlow is actually tightly
      controlled by an industry consortium).

  html: Well, if you have a OpenFlow Network with a controller, the controller will
    have the whole network topology.<br /><br />With that, you don&#39;t need STP...
    The controller will make an openflow path end-to-end. Don&#39;t need STP to control
    loops. And instead of getting 1 link down and 1 up(non-vlan STP), you&#39;ll get
    full bandwidth for as many uplinks as possible. Your controller is supposed to
    create unique paths that don&#39;t cause loop.<br /><br />LACP you could replace
    the same way, the controller will known the state of each link and if one path
    gets down, it will check the network topology and trace another path. For now,
    active passive should be possible without putting something on the edge.<br /><br
    />And don&#39;t worry, since it&#39;s *open* if you don&#39;t make one, somebody
    will and eventually will became opensource for everybody use... Comercial ones
    will come as well.<br /><br />Solutions for everybody tastes...<br /><br /><br
    />Anyways, this is something coming to the masses this year... Let&#39;s see how
    it goes =)

    html: No, FlowVisor is slicing existing OpenFlow switches into multiple instances.
      It&#39;s a long way from there to virtual networks.

  html: in my opinion, playing flow tables are more fun than either playing mac-table
    :D or routing-tables. we can define more functions in a flow table, not just matching
    mac-address nor just matching the most specific ip prefix. we are free to define
    the matching rule.. cmiiw :D

    html: Pure OpenFlow switch is by definition a totally dumb device. It cannot communicate
      with anything but the controller. The controller has to implement all legacy
      protocols.

    a legacy switch other than the legacyflow concept?<br />
