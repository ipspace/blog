Every RIB (global and VRF) gets copied into FIB which gets copied into TCAM or equivalent forwarding structure. <br /><br />If you have two copies of full Internet routing table (one in global RIB, one in a VRF, for example), you&#39;re using twice as much TCAM as well.",

      "html": "Given that this just consumes additional RAM (not actual TCAM for packet forwarding), and that most new edge devices have somewhere from 4g to 16g to play with... is this a real problem on a modern network? RAM is something we can throw at problems to make them go away, large production x86 boxes often have hundreds of gig of ram.<br /><br />Alternatively, what are the advantages to keeping complete control and isolation of multiple upstream internet connections?<br /><br />Certainly the ability to control import and export PER upstream peer open the door to new revenue opportunities. Imagine you had a dozen peers (each with its own internet RT) to level3, cogent, tata, xo, zayo, etc. You would be able to sell a custom blend mix of BGP per customer by importing those upstream provider RT&#39;s into their internet VPN giving them the desired blended billing rate.<br /><br />Regional routing control could be more granular on a single-AS backbone (only import in-region peered providers into a VRF), VERY fast repair time with prefix independant convergence, and potentially some useful loadsharing options add themselves to the tool belt as well.<br /><br />This is a long standing, heated, design discussion topic between customers and vendors. The impact is fairly clear, but the actual cost of burning memory vs potential feature benefit later are murky.<br /><br />Right now my approach is splitting the best of both worlds by keeping the private IP VPN service on one set of edge devices, and the internet peering on another. If an internet VRF on the VPN PE needs to get out, I provide it a default route from the internet PE in the same POP (Different BGP ASN) and let it make the intelligent forwarding decisions based on a giant internet global routing table.<br /><br />That all said, I might rig up a test of my own with some of the new asr9001&#39;s at work. I am more than a little curious to see what happens with more upstream peers.",
