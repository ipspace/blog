Consequences will likely be quite close to the aforementioned, too. ;)",

      "html": "&gt; They split the inside (your site) and the outside (service provider transport network) into two separate L3 subnets and two failure domains<br /><br />A Service Provider offering Metro Ethernet service cannot force the customer to use routers at the end of eline/etree/elan. So such a service is equal to L2 DCI and the core network needs to be prepared against a meltdown. <br /><br />What is the reason of the meltdown in L2? Intermittent loops and excessive flood. Both can be limited. The most dangerous is a loop. It can happen and happens also in Metro Ethernet networks because customers are connecting L2 devices (also two sites using a backdoor link). Does it mean that Metro Ethernet should not be offered? It is reasonable to find solutions to eliminate meltdown threats and there are such mechanisms which are far better than a normal STP.<br /><br />But I agree with you in terms of Data Center Interconnect. If there is a L3 choice take it first. This is a simple strategy how to avoid a risk.<br /><br />&gt;Typical IP hosts have no means of detecting the VLAN failure or partitioning, and cannot find alternate paths. They rely on network devices providing the connectivity,<br /><br />IMHO this is also true for Metro Ethernet with L3 devices.",

      "html": "I think you have confused the situation with a bit of bias:<br />- Metro ethernet has good path protection schemes which you have discounted in your analysis.<br />- Metro ethernet has filters which are available and broadcast containment is not the exclusive domain of L3<br />- You eat your own dogfood with QinQ (what you put in is what you take out)  The Metro ethernet network does not melt, it is typically your own dogfood that is unpalatable.<br /><br />However, I agree with L3 termination but not for the reasons you have given:<br />- traffic shaping is required to match the purchased bandwidth<br />- paths need to be secured and optimized<br /><br />Streched data centre vlans are not a problem if there is sufficient capacity to disregard shaping requirements and the paths are secure.  Most storage using FC is stretched. <br /><br />Meltdowns are not exclusive to L2 stupidity, there is an equal if not larger amount of L3 stupidity.",
