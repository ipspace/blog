    html: You got it right.<br /><br />If you import Internet routes from global BGP
      into a VRF, you&#39;d probably still have a single copy of the BGP table (otherwise
      it would be identical to the inter-VRF import scenario), but two copies of RIB
      (global+VRF) and FIB (global+VRF). <br /><br />There&#39;s enough data in the
      above printouts to estimate what the increase in memory consumption would be;
      I&#39;d guess it would be closer to 80% than to 8%.

  html: Great article as always.<br /><br />So here is my summary in short to see
    if I do understood it right<br /><br />So Internet in a vrf has a 8% /18% more
    Memory usage.<br />This memory usage is Quite Huge  ~80% if you import into another
    VPN instance. <br /><br /><br />What I am missing in this comparissing is following
    setup:<br />Internet in the Global table<br />Import Global table into vrf.

  html: What hardware platform?  Sorry if I missed it in there.  The platform I was
    choking on was the ASR 1K.  In addition to the RIB, BGP topology info, and CEF,
    all in the IOS container, it makes a copy of the CEF data structure in main memory
    as well.

    html: Actually, we were discussing ideas along the same lines at the time when
      I was writing the MPLS/VPN book, the problem always being the amount of memory
      you&#39;d need for numerous copies of full Internet routing table.<br /><br
      />Also, it&#39;s not just RAM. Every RIB (global and VRF) gets copied into FIB
      which gets copied into TCAM or equivalent forwarding structure. <br /><br />If
      you have two copies of full Internet routing table (one in global RIB, one in
      a VRF, for example), you&#39;re using twice as much TCAM as well.

    html: ILNPv6? It just might ... assuming you can change TCP stacks in all the
      hosts connected to the Internet in reasonable time. <br /><br />On the other
      hand, there just might be a gradual migration path (non-ILNPv6 hosts wouldn&#39;t
      get the extra resilience), but nobody would want to be the first one to go down
      it.

  html: Given that this just consumes additional RAM (not actual TCAM for packet forwarding),
    and that most new edge devices have somewhere from 4g to 16g to play with... is
    this a real problem on a modern network? RAM is something we can throw at problems
    to make them go away, large production x86 boxes often have hundreds of gig of
    ram.<br /><br />Alternatively, what are the advantages to keeping complete control
    and isolation of multiple upstream internet connections?<br /><br />Certainly
    the ability to control import and export PER upstream peer open the door to new
    revenue opportunities. Imagine you had a dozen peers (each with its own internet
    RT) to level3, cogent, tata, xo, zayo, etc. You would be able to sell a custom
    blend mix of BGP per customer by importing those upstream provider RT&#39;s into
    their internet VPN giving them the desired blended billing rate.<br /><br />Regional
    routing control could be more granular on a single-AS backbone (only import in-region
    peered providers into a VRF), VERY fast repair time with prefix independant convergence,
    and potentially some useful loadsharing options add themselves to the tool belt
    as well.<br /><br />This is a long standing, heated, design discussion topic between
    customers and vendors. The impact is fairly clear, but the actual cost of burning
    memory vs potential feature benefit later are murky.<br /><br />Right now my approach
    is splitting the best of both worlds by keeping the private IP VPN service on
    one set of edge devices, and the internet peering on another. If an internet VRF
    on the VPN PE needs to get out, I provide it a default route from the internet
    PE in the same POP (Different BGP ASN) and let it make the intelligent forwarding
    decisions based on a giant internet global routing table.<br /><br />That all
    said, I might rig up a test of my own with some of the new asr9001&#39;s at work.
    I am more than a little curious to see what happens with more upstream peers.

    html: If you&#39;re leaking Internet routes from one VRF to another, you can avoid
      the TCAM hit (because you&#39;re only instantiating customer VRFs on the customer-facing
      PE-routers). <br /><br />If you carry Internet routing in the global routing
      table, then you&#39;ll always get double TCAM entries.

  html: You are correct, my statement regarding TCAM was poorly worded. I was trying
    to reference that instanciating VRFs on the peering edge devices for customers
    was not necessary, and vice versa on the customer edge devices. I will have to
    think that all through again and see if there is a workaround to scaling the FIB.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Love the description of this issue, very informative.  Are
    there any case-studies you&#39;ve come cross where the MPLS Provider is providing
    both L3VPN services and Internet services in a single VRF, and sending more than
    a default-route for Internet services into the VRF?  <br /><br />Thanks!

  html: 'I have seen some providers offer internet services in vrf, but that is just
    1 global vrf for customers and separate vrf per customer for private services.
    This does scale when just 1 internet vrf is used and internet peering is done
    directly in the vrf. But you loss and can be waiting for functionality to be implement
    on vrf interface/service which is only available today in the grt. '

    html: In theory, of course it works. In practice, you wouldn&#39;t want to carry
      multiple copies of full routing table around, so as long as you can reduce the
      number of routes (or have too much RAM and oversized FIB) you should be fine.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Your approach here seems very interesting to me. I&#39;m
    working for a GSM provider, and I think of createing a new MPLS backbone based,
    with Internet in a vrf (multi site peering) as well as other ISP in another vrf
    for private interconnection. Have you ever encountered such design ? Do it seems
    consistant from a security point of view ?<br /><br />Regards<br />Patrice
