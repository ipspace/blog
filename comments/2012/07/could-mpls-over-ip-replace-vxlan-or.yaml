  html: I haven&#39;t deepdived into this topic, so i&#39;m probably throwing something
    around here, but couldn&#39;t MPLS-TP be used to emulate a VNI? Also mVPN technology
    is evolving. If mLDP is used, a MP2MP can be setup and no IP Multicast is required
    for L2 flooding. Also PBB-EVPN could solve the multihoming?

  html: Hi Dirk,<br />Interesting points. I agree mLDP can potentially perform a similar
    role with a L3 VPN setup. VMkernel in a host can act as a PE router with the IP
    network running LDP. However, it will also require the VMkernel to run BGP. I
    think even PBB-VPLS would be a viable option. We are running PBB-VPLS in a service
    provider environment.

      they find a customer who would be willing to pay for it&quot; ... maybe I was

  html: 'The benefit of doing MPLS is obvious:  Immediate unification of virtual compute
    and networking using a standard, mature and fairly well understood protocol.  <br
    /><br />Also, you don&#39;t have to run LDP or VPNv4 on the hypervisor, a controller
    could do that.'

  html: Nice job Ian of extracting out the benefits and challenges of the RFC4023
    solutions that exist, and are being deployed today, which I am a fan of, especially
    in the WAN for branch back-haul.<br /><br />A very good add-on discussion to the
    post would be looking at LISP, and the abstracted control-plane it offers.  Once
    multicast is supported, there is no reason why L2-over-IP could not be leveraged.  It
    natively uses IP-over-IP (UDP), and has the control-plane to scale (analogous
    to DNS).  An interesting topic for sure as LISP evolves.

  html: As far as I understand, VXLAN, NVGRE and any tunneling protocol that use global
    ID in the data plane cannot support PVLAN functionality. I&#39;m told the way
    to solve this issue is to use edge virtual firewall (like iptables or vGW) which
    can be difficult if the subnet address space isn&#39;t carved up in maskable blocks
    (or ranges) by user groups.<br /><br />Furthermore, if edge virtual firewalls
    are inevitably required to do basic network-level segmentation, then I see no
    reason why a private cloud with no overlapping address space needs any more than
    a single all spanning virtual network with edge virtual firewalls to implement
    all segmentation (network and application level granularity).

    html: OTV is interconnecting two L2 networks, not providing virtual networks like
      VXLAN or NVGRE. It does not fit into the same picture.

  html: Another avenue to pursue regarding virtualized resources, OTV.<br />It&#39;s
    a rather interesting time to see progression and maturity of network technology
    to create new solutions to the virtualized data centers.<br /><br />http://blog.ine.com/2012/08/17/otv-decoded-a-fancy-gre-tunnel/<br
    /><br />...&quot;From a high level overview, OTV is basically a layer 2 over layer
    3 tunneling protocol. In essence OTV accomplishes the same goal as other L2 tunneling
    protocols such as L2TPv3, Any Transport over MPLS (AToM), or Virtual Private LAN
    Services (VPLS). For OTV specifically this goal is to take Ethernet frames from
    an end station, like a virtual machine, encapsulate them inside IPv4, transport
    them over the Data Center Interconnect (DCI) network, decapsulate them on the
    other side, and out pops your original Ethernet frame.&quot;

    html: While this makes sense from network architecture perspective, it tightly
      couples hypervisor and ToR switches and makes deployment/orchestration way more
      complex, so I don&#39;t expect to see this architecture widely deployed.

    html: 'Thank you Ivan , <br /><br />From cloud perspective , you&#39;ll disagree
      with my option, I believe you prefer putting all service within the virtualization
      framework ,nothing to do with physical network infrastructure. <br /><br />Network
      admin will be going mad , since all they can see are tunnel packets , they are
      of no help if there is problem.<br /><br />It&#39;s true that at current stage,
      there are limitations and complex to orchestrate and tightly couple hypervisor
      with ToR. : )<br /><br />If combining with O/F , hypervisor tightly couples
      with control plane servers/clusters , not ToR switch. it&#39;ll be more reasonable.'

  html: I prefer <br />1/offload the network function from hypervisor to physical
    access switch, as what VM-FEX does<br />2/ physical access switch support VXLAN<br
    />3/ decouple the control plane layer to manage VXLAN.<br /><br />it&#39;ll solve
    the VM to VM, VM to physical, physical to physical traffic, and VLAN limitations
    for the whole data center, and decrease quantities of VXLAN switches.<br /><br

    html: VXLAN has a slight advantage over GRE (or NVGRE) - it can use the source
      UDP port to improve load balancing across leaf-and-spine fabrics.<br /><br />Whatever
      the reason, the whole industry has standardized on VXLAN (even Microsoft will
      support it in the next Hyper-V release... or maybe it&#39;s already shipping?),
      so we better get used to it ;)

  html: Much water has flown under the bridge since you wrote this but given the direction
    (think VXLAN GPE, multiple control planes, etc), how about simply using GRE+UDP
    ? At the very least, it would look and feel familiar for everyone involved (developers,
    operators, etc) and one less encap format to learn!
