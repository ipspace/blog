      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I realise this post is quite old now, but have you found a way of creating CNAME records in IOS?<br /><br />I&#39;m using IOS for rDNS lookup for some of my server provisioning and would like a server IP to resolve to the proper A hostname record, rather than a CNAME alias.<br /><br />I&#39;ve found if you do a rDNS lookup you get the name the router first finds in its config. Therefore I can force the preferred hostname but it&#39;s not very elegant and is error prone. E.g.<br /><br />ip host mycryptichostname 10.1.1.100<br />ip host mycnamealias 10.1.1.100<br /><br />I can&#39;t find any way to enter a CNAME proper though (e.g. http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2/ip/configuration/guide/1cfipadr.html#wp1067293) - just wonder if you or one of your readers had?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Simon",
