  html: I was not able to get DDNS server working on Cisco IOS. It can send the DDNS
    requests to an external server, but somehow cannot keep a DDNS cache internally
    (if that was the question).

    html: Well on the 2621x happened to me that 2621x Cisco Routers with 128 RAM begin
      to work with ip dns server but when you are in a network with 184 systems requesting
      dns resolution the cisco just hang out. I just buy another 128 RAM and now is
      working fine.

  html: This has worked perfectly on my Cisco 2800, 2600, 1800 and 1700 series routers.  I
    suggest one read Cisco&#39;s documentation regarding dynamic name resolution.  For
    example, ip domain list and ip domain name are also required.

    html: Really??? There&#39;s a slight difference between DNS server and DNS client.
      Please read the Cisco IOS documentation for both commands.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I realise this post is quite old now, but have you found
    a way of creating CNAME records in IOS?<br /><br />I&#39;m using IOS for rDNS
    lookup for some of my server provisioning and would like a server IP to resolve
    to the proper A hostname record, rather than a CNAME alias.<br /><br />I&#39;ve
    found if you do a rDNS lookup you get the name the router first finds in its config.
    Therefore I can force the preferred hostname but it&#39;s not very elegant and
    is error prone. E.g.<br /><br />ip host mycryptichostname 10.1.1.100<br />ip host
    mycnamealias 10.1.1.100<br /><br />I can&#39;t find any way to enter a CNAME proper
    though (e.g. http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2/ip/configuration/guide/1cfipadr.html#wp1067293)
    - just wonder if you or one of your readers had?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Simon

    it puts SOA RR into Authority section, instead of Answer section
