  html: In a scenario where customer takes links from two service providers and wants
    to load share the traffic between the links, will equimetric default routes in
    the routing table (and thereby in the cef table) actually load share per packet
    or per destination or per session ?<br /><br />Ramya

  html: The CEF load-sharing mechanism depends on what you've configured on outgoing
    interfaces (links toward the ISPs) with the <strong>ip load-sharing</strong> configuration
    command.<br /><br />Load sharing can be <em>per-source-destination-pair</em> (default),
    <em>per-packet</em> (strongly discouraged in this scenario, as the packets will
    be almost guaranteed to arrive out-of-order) or <em>per-flow</em> (see <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2006/12/per-port-cef-load-sharing.html">Per-port
    CEF load sharing</a>).

  html: Do you know if "show ip cef exact-route" command is supported for 3560 switches?.
    It seems that the output of the command shows not correct information.

  html: Hi, Great site. With Per-destination or Per-Packet switching, how does both
    interact with a dynamic routing protocol like EIGRP which has variance or can
    consider multiple links and perform unequal-cost load balancing? Does the "switching"
    override the routing protocol?<BR/>I'm a bit unclear about this?<BR/>And especially
    if BGP is involved!<BR/>Thanks.

  html: The "switching" part takes place after the routing table has been built and
    cannot influence the routing table at all. If you're using EIGRP variance or BGP
    DMZ bandwidth, the <A HREF="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2006/10/cef-load-sharing-details.html"
    REL="nofollow">ratio of entries in the CEF table</A> reflects the ratio between
    the path costs.

  html: The absolute maximum CEF can support is 16 (the hash values used to select
    outgoing interface are 4-bit long). With anything even close to that limit you'll
    not get perfect load sharing due to rounding errors.<BR/><BR/>If you have significantly
    more than four parallel links, you might consider upgrading to a higher-speed
    solution.
