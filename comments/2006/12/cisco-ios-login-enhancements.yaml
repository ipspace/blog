  html: Sure you can ... just write your own access-list (similar to <I>sl_def_acl</I>)
    and use it for quiet mode blocking with the <B>login quiet-mode access-class</B>.

  html: I just wanted to note that the quiet-mode access-class overrides your VTY
    access-class for the duration of quiet-mode.  So, if you have a ACL applied to
    the VTY already and the router goes into quiet-mode, the quiet-mode access-class
    is used in place of your VTY ACL.  When quiet-mode is over, your VTY ACL is re-applied.

  html: '@Eugene: you don''t need the ACL on a VTY line (it''s only needed in quiet
    mode or if you want to enhance the router''s security). <BR/><BR/>Check your logging
    configuration (I usually use <B>logging buffered</B> to simplify things) and if
    you really don''t get the messages, open a case with Cisco TAC.'

  html: The sl_def_acl acl is generated anyway.<br />With the  login quiet-mode access-class
    command, introduced in Cisco IOS Release 12.3(4)T, the Cisco IOS router uses the
    configured ACL to permit login attempts when the router switches to quiet mode.
    If this command is not configured, all connection attempts are denied during the
    quiet period.<br /><br />The ACL also specifies IP addresses that are excluded
    from login failure counting using the login quiet-mode access-class {acl-name
    | acl-number} command

  html: I must mention that I worked on pen tests on Cisco routers with the help of
    Back Track. I noticed something very important, when you type the command login
    delay 10 (10 is the largest value in the Cisco IOS) and run dictionary attack,
    which has 30 parallel sessions at a time, every 10 seconds will be tested 30 combinations
    (it is possible to set a higher number of sessions in one attempt on attacking
    software). Login delay 10 command (typed alone on router) will not significantly
    slow the persistent attackers.<br /><br />Therefore, it is better to use a command
    such as login block-for 10 attempts 3 within 10. After I entered only this command
    on the Cisco router and started an identical attack, after the 3rd attempt router
    has stopped all sessions from the PC.
