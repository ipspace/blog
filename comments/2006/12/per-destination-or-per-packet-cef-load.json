With Per-destination or Per-Packet switching, how does both interact with a dynamic routing protocol like EIGRP which has variance or can consider multiple links and perform unequal-cost load balancing? Does the \"switching\" override the routing protocol?<BR/>I'm a bit unclear about this?<BR/>And especially if BGP is involved!<BR/>Thanks.",
