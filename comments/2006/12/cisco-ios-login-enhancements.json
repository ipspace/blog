      "html": "I just wanted to note that the quiet-mode access-class overrides your VTY access-class for the duration of quiet-mode.  So, if you have a ACL applied to the VTY already and the router goes into quiet-mode, the quiet-mode access-class is used in place of your VTY ACL.  When quiet-mode is over, your VTY ACL is re-applied.",

I noticed something very important, when you type the command login delay 10 (10 is the largest value in the Cisco IOS) and run dictionary attack, which has 30 parallel sessions at a time, every 10 seconds will be tested 30 combinations (it is possible to set a higher number of sessions in one attempt on attacking software). Login delay 10 command (typed alone on router) will not significantly slow the persistent attackers.<br /><br />Therefore, it is better to use a command such as login block-for 10 attempts 3 within 10. After I entered only this command on the Cisco router and started an identical attack, after the 3rd attempt router has stopped all sessions from the PC.",
