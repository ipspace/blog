      "html": "Regardless of what any load-sharing algorithm actually does, if it spreads the load based on source/destination IP addresses only, it will (statistically) not behave too well in an environment with a small number of hosts. For such an environment, you need <a href=\"http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2006/12/per-port-cef-load-sharing.html\">per-flow load sharing</a>.<br /><br />I did a few tests with the <b>tunnel</b> algorithm and it definitely <b>does NOT</b> consider source/destination address of the encapsulated IP packet within the GRE payload. The only other available information is from the Cisco web site saying that it would perform better than the universal algorithm in tunnel-heavy (where the interim routers only see tunnel endpoints).",

Whatever our eBGP neigh is doing, they spread the load pretty well... we don&#39;t.  Sh ip cef X still shows &quot;per-destination sharing&quot; in the output.  I tried a clear of the cef table as well.  Do I need to refresh the RIB (flap BGP, etc)?  I can&#39;t do that now.",

Though the routing table and CEF shows two equal cost path for next hop, the packets are always sent via one path.CEF load sharing algorithm was changed from universal to tunnel, even then also both the paths are not being used. This product does not support per packet load sharing. Please Advice me a work around with which i can utilise both the available path.",
