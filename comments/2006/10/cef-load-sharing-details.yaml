  html: I have a 7204 with IOS 12.2 and &#39;show ip cef A.B.C.D internal&#39; is
    not available. Do you know any equivalent for it? I&#39;m interested in the &#39;Load
    distribution&#39; info, or something equivalent to it.

  html: 'Hello, Ivan! <br /><br />I just wanted to share with you what I&#39;ve found
    today, which is strange behavior of IOS in my opinion. <br /><br />Today I was
    analyzing a traffic flow for one of our customers, when I had to check the information
    in CEF table regarding 0.0.0.0/32 prefix. I was curious to get that information
    from CEF table because there is multipath BGP load balance:<br /><br />tbirouter#show
    ip bgp 0.0.0.0/0<br />BGP routing table entry for 0.0.0.0/0, version 1774830<br
    />Paths: (2 available, best #1, table Default-IP-Routing-Table)<br />Multipath:
    eBGP<br />  Not advertised to any peer<br />  1234<br />       Origin IGP, localpref
    100, valid, external, multipath, best<br />  5678<br />       Origin IGP, localpref
    100, valid, external, multipath<br /><br />I decided to check what does CEF table
    says when I tried with these commands:<br /><br />tbirouter#show ip cef 0.0.0.0
    det<br />0.0.0.0/32, version 1, epoch 0, receive<br />tbirouter#show ip cef 0.0.0.0
    int<br />0.0.0.0/32, version 1, epoch 0, receive<br />tbirouter#show ip cef 0.0.0.0/32
    int<br />                             ^<br />% Invalid input detected at &#39;^&#39;
    marker.<br /><br />And here it comes the most interesting part of the story -
    my typo command which get me exactly what I needed. <br /><br />show ip cef 0.0.0.032
    internal &lt;------------------ 0.0.0.032<br />0.0.0.0/0, version 1303100, epoch

  html: Well, your problem is (very probably) the discrepancy between what the router
    prints out (0.0.0.0/32) and what it wants to get (0.0.0.0/0). When you&#39;ve
    typed in 0.0.0.032, the router understood that to be 0.0.0.0/0 (due to the subnet
    mask on 0.0.0.0). <br /><br />I agree, it&#39;s confusing  :-E

  html: Greetings,<br /><br />             I am studying MPLS these days and there
    is a very basic thing which I am confused with ..I tried to find the details on
    Google but didnt get any good link ...Can somone plz explain me whats the difference
    between a ROUTING TABLE AND FIB ?<br /><br />I would really be very obligied if
    somone can help  :-[

    /><br />The same topic is also described in my MPLS/VPN Architectures book.

  html: Thanks a lot Ivan..That link is really great .....So that means FIB contains
    the actual next-hop IP and the exit interface to reach any network whereas RIB
    just have the next hop IP [ which can be some ip which is not directly connected
    to the router] ....FIB is faster than RIB becoz it doesnt do the recursive lookup........Plz
    correct me if I am wrong anywhere !!

  html: Very informative.  I wonder why true load balancing (non fixed hash position
    in a path table) isn&#39;t implemented for both L2, e.g. etherchannels, and CEF.  The
    way it&#39;s implemented is more deterministic, but can be perceived as a bottle
    neck for high throughput flows.<br /><br />Though, thinking about in-order-delivery,
    I suppose fixing a flow to a specific path is a good thing.  But what are the
    real risks, and incidence probability, if per packet load balancing is used.

  html: Can you give some idea on a particular bucket assigned for the interface will
    remain to that interface upto what time? if 6 Bucket assgined to 1 link and that
    link goes down will that bucket imediatelly asigned to another parallel link or
    2nd second link not be able to use that buckets <br /><br />say buckets 0 2 4
    6 8 10 12 14 are for interface 1 <br />and buckets 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 are for
    interface 2 <br /><br />if interface 2 goes down, then buckets will be freed and
    assigned to interface 1 or that buckets will not be utilized. if buckets are freed
    after how much time will it allocate to interface 2 .... or what is the bucket
    refresh time ! <br /><br />can u led me to source/rfc for the same ! <br />
