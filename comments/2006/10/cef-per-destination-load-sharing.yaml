  html: I would love to know what the tunnel algorithm does.  We want to load share
    between just a few hosts and destinations and this seems like it would work better
    than the others based on the cisco description, but I  can't find any detail on
    the tunnel algorithm.

  html: Regardless of what any load-sharing algorithm actually does, if it spreads
    the load based on source/destination IP addresses only, it will (statistically)
    not behave too well in an environment with a small number of hosts. For such an
    environment, you need <a href="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2006/12/per-port-cef-load-sharing.html">per-flow
    load sharing</a>.<br /><br />I did a few tests with the <b>tunnel</b> algorithm
    and it definitely <b>does NOT</b> consider source/destination address of the encapsulated
    IP packet within the GRE payload. The only other available information is from
    the Cisco web site saying that it would perform better than the universal algorithm
    in tunnel-heavy (where the interim routers only see tunnel endpoints).

  html: 'I''d love to implement per-flow, but I have a 6509 with a sup2 and it does
    not seem to support 12.4(11)T.  It was the second half of cisco load-sharing algorithm
    tunnel command description that was giving me hope: "or in environments where
    there are only a few IP source and destination address pairs."  Are there any
    additional thoughts on this?'

  html: I have a c7600/sup720/12.2(33)SRE box that I am trying to improve the 3x1GigE
    BGP multihop distribution... we have only a few soruce/dest pairs, and one link
    has only a few pps(40 right now) outbound, the other two are 200M each...  we
    have other BGP mh sessions that are similar, so I figured it was CEF related hashing....  I
    just added &quot;ip cef load-sharing algorithm include-ports source destination&quot;
    with no luck -- no change in traffic distribution.  Whatever our eBGP neigh is
    doing, they spread the load pretty well... we don&#39;t.  Sh ip cef X still shows
    &quot;per-destination sharing&quot; in the output.  I tried a clear of the cef
    table as well.  Do I need to refresh the RIB (flap BGP, etc)?  I can&#39;t do
    that now.

  html: I just added &quot;mls ip cef load-sharing full&quot; to acompish the proper
    effect... but I don&#39;t yet understand why this is under the mls function??<br

  html: 6500 is a &quot;very special&quot; device and it&#39;s multi-layer switching
    (MLS) is full of caveats and murkiness that needs to be hand-tweaked with &quot;mls
    ...&quot; commands, most of them hidden and/or undocumented.

  html: Hi, I just had adiscussion about the algorthm of loadsharing and found these
    hints. Given a table with 5 entries does it mean that 3 go line 1 and 2 line 2
    and the next entry would go line 2 as well or there a different algorthm used?

  html: i have 3560-24PS through which a GRE tunnel is passing through. Though the
    routing table and CEF shows two equal cost path for next hop, the packets are
    always sent via one path.CEF load sharing algorithm was changed from universal
    to tunnel, even then also both the paths are not being used. This product does
    not support per packet load sharing. Please Advice me a work around with which
    i can utilise both the available path.
