I was curious to get that information from CEF table because there is multipath BGP load balance:<br /><br />tbirouter#show ip bgp 0.0.0.0/0<br />BGP routing table entry for 0.0.0.0/0, version 1774830<br />Paths: (2 available, best #1, table Default-IP-Routing-Table)<br />Multipath: eBGP<br />  Not advertised to any peer<br />  1234<br />       Origin IGP, localpref 100, valid, external, multipath, best<br />  5678<br />       Origin IGP, localpref 100, valid, external, multipath<br /><br />I decided to check what does CEF table says when I tried with these commands:<br /><br />tbirouter#show ip cef 0.0.0.0 det<br />0.0.0.0/32, version 1, epoch 0, receive<br />tbirouter#show ip cef 0.0.0.0 int<br />0.0.0.0/32, version 1, epoch 0, receive<br />tbirouter#show ip cef 0.0.0.0/32 int<br />                             ^<br />% Invalid input detected at &#39;^&#39; marker.<br /><br />And here it comes the most interesting part of the story - my typo command which get me exactly what I needed. <br /><br />show ip cef 0.0.0.032 internal &lt;------------------ 0.0.0.032<br />0.0.0.0/0, version 1303100, epoch 0, per-destination sharing<br />0 packets, 0 bytes<br />  via 2.2.2.20 0 dependencies, recursive<br />    traffic share 1<br />    next hop 2.2.2.2, GigabitEthernet0/0.3467 via 2.2.2.2/32<br />    valid adjacency<br />  via 1.1.1.1, 0 dependencies, recursive<br />    traffic share 1<br />    next hop 1.1.1.10, GigabitEthernet0/0.3197 via 1.1.1.1/32<br />    valid adjacency<br /><br />  0 packets, 0 bytes switched through the prefix<br />  tmstats: external 0 packets, 0 bytes<br />           internal 0 packets, 0 bytes<br />  Load distribution: 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 (refcount 1)<br /><br />  Hash  OK  Interface                 Address         Packets<br />  1     Y   GigabitEthernet0/0.3467   2.2.2.2         0<br />  2     Y   GigabitEthernet0/0.3197   1.1.1.1           0<br />  3     Y   GigabitEthernet0/0.3467   2.2.2.2         0<br />  4     Y   GigabitEthernet0/0.3197   1.1.1.1           0<br />  5     Y   GigabitEthernet0/0.3467   2.2.2.2         0<br />  6     Y   GigabitEthernet0/0.3197   1.1.1.1           0<br />  7     Y   GigabitEthernet0/0.3467   2.2.2.2         0<br />  8     Y   GigabitEthernet0/0.3197   1.1.1.1           0<br />  9     Y   GigabitEthernet0/0.3467   2.2.2.2         0<br />  10    Y   GigabitEthernet0/0.3197   1.1.1.1           0<br />  11    Y   GigabitEthernet0/0.3467   2.2.2.2         0<br />  12    Y   GigabitEthernet0/0.3197   1.1.1.1           0<br />  13    Y   GigabitEthernet0/0.3467   2.2.2.2         0<br />  14    Y   GigabitEthernet0/0.3197   1.1.1.1           0<br />  15    Y   GigabitEthernet0/0.3467   2.2.2.2         0<br />  16    Y   GigabitEthernet0/0.3197   1.1.1.1           0<br />  refcount 718612, covered prefixes:<br /><br />Have you noticed this?<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Dani Petrov",

When you&#39;ve typed in 0.0.0.032, the router understood that to be 0.0.0.0/0 (due to the subnet mask on 0.0.0.0). <br /><br />I agree, it&#39;s confusing  :-E",

The way it&#39;s implemented is more deterministic, but can be perceived as a bottle neck for high throughput flows.<br /><br />Though, thinking about in-order-delivery, I suppose fixing a flow to a specific path is a good thing.  But what are the real risks, and incidence probability, if per packet load balancing is used.",
