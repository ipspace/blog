  html: when you use the new zone base fw feature. when you drop and log all other
    traffic in a policy, is the log function done using CEF or process switching?

  html: Hello, <br /><br />is it mandatory to use "Class class-default --> Drop" statement
    in  Policy map or Policy map automatically rejects everything what is not permitted/inspected?
    For example I would like to permit https traffic and reject everything else. Do
    I need to input "Class class-default --> Drop" ?<br /><br />Thank you and Kind
    regards,Marko

  html: I've read your book, which I found clear and well put together.<BR/><BR/>I
    was, however, left wondering why there was such little apparent use made of the
    feature in real life.<BR/><BR/>IOS Zone-based firewalls are supposed to be easier
    to set up and understand (arguable), more precise, and possibly offering higher
    throughput, but there seem to be relatively few examples of their use, even with
    their support in SDM 2.4.<BR/><BR/>Is it because<BR/><BR/>(a) they are a relatively
    recent addition to IOS and so there is less documentation / experience / expertise
    available for their use.<BR/><BR/>(b) they are not easier to configure/maintain
    in practice.<BR/><BR/>For example you still need to use Access Control Lists to
    let particular types of icmp through, because the ZBF operates on a protocol basis.<BR/><BR/>And,
    instead of an easy to read list of what is blocked/passed, you have zones, zone
    links, protocol inspection rules, etc. Even with SDM, there is a good deal of
    setting up of the building blocks before you can use them.<BR/><BR/>Am I missing
    something?

  html: Thanks for your thoughts about the book :)<BR/><BR/>I would assume that the
    (current)low acceptance of the zone-based configuration is based both on the release
    it's available in (I would never put an "experimental" IOS release like a T release
    in my production network unless forced to do so by a mandatory feature or new
    hardware platform) as well as relative unfamiliarity (people still think in terms
    of access lists).<BR/><BR/>I also agree with you that the configuration interface
    is a bit baroque (with classes, policies, inter-zone service policies ...) and
    it's definitely easier to write an access list ... if you have only two zones.
    However, try writing an access list for a complex firewall with 4 or 5 zones (where
    you have to merge all your inter-zone policies into a single access list) and
    you'll start appreciating the zone-based configuration. The configuration model
    is even more useful if you have multiple zones that have the same inter-zone policy
    toward a target zone (for example, all internal zones have the same policy toward
    the Internet).<BR/><BR/>Having said all that, a year ago, I would probably still
    stick to the access-lists (even if the zone-based configuration would be available
    in a GD release) if I'd have to do a quick configuration job. Having climbed the
    learning curve, I will definitely use the new approach in my future projects ...
    once it becomes available in a stable major release.

  html: I have just provisioned a router with from scratch using SDM2.4.<BR/><BR/>It
    now installs a zone-based firewall by default.<BR/><BR/>I am struggling to<BR/><BR/>(1)
    get BGP going, to pick up bogon lists from cymru (repeated no route to peer messages)<BR/><BR/>(2)  L2TP/IPSec
    connections.<BR/><BR/>This is a straightforward DSL+LAN setup (no DMZ).<BR/><BR/>My
    main issue (apart from the sheer number of settings that SDM generates) is a confusion
    between when to use self and when to use in/outside.

  html: You're right regarding the IPSec issues, I also wrote a post <A HREF="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/05/self-zone-in-zone-based-firewall.html"
    REL="nofollow">detailing the rules of the <B>self</B> zone usage</A>.<BR/><BR/>As
    for the BGP session, it looks like the router is not willing to use the default
    route to get to its BGP peer. Interesting, will check it in my lab :)

  html: The other thing that I am noticing is that cymru BGP appears to be trying
    to send a message from port 179 into a random high-numbered port in my router.  This
    gets blocked, even though I am inspecting outgoing bgp.<BR/><BR/>Perhaps it is
    something to do with the time it takes to build IPS signatures as the ATM goes
    up

  html: A further example that would be helpful is the setup for SIP.<BR/><BR/>I notice
    that just opening SIP and RTP (in my case 5004 or 5006) does not help. I also
    seem to have to open UDP to get the RTP connection to work; otherwise, it just
    seems to be blocked, even if it is open.<BR/><BR/>Thanks.

  html: I <A HREF="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/01/firewalls-kill-tcp-performance-when.html"
    REL="nofollow">wrote a post about this problem</A> a while ago, but as it was
    mis-labeled, even I had problems finding it :( ... fixed now.<BR/><BR/>The only
    situation where you'd get out-of-order TCP packets in real life is if a box anywhere
    in the end-to-end path is doing per-packet load sharing ... or if you do weird
    QoS stuff classifying some TCP packets in a session in a different class than
    others (for example, mark long packets low-priority).

  html: Apart from buying a faster router, disabling the deep packet inspection or
    upgrading IOS (and hoping that a newer release is more optimized), there's not
    much you can do, it's a CPU-intensive task. Just to be on the safe side, inspect
    the "show proc cpu" output to verify that the CPU load is really getting close
    to 100%.

    about such topic? I heard about an specific solution using an special hairpin
    to decapsulate and loop back the traffic using a tunnel interface.<br /><br />Thanks....

  html: Hi Ivan, thank you for your response, I&#39;m working on a exercise where
    they ask to apply inspection (ZBF) to the VPN traffic between two PEs. Basically
    the solution provided is creating a new VRF on the device along with a Tunnel,
    one of the Tunnel interfaces belong to the newly created VRF and the other to
    the VRF already present, essentially linking both VRF&#39;s back-to-back on the
    same router. Finally the policies are applied on the tunnel interface, where the
    traffic is transiting unlabeled. Until now, this solution (VRFs workaround) has
    been difficult to understand.<br />By the way, your book on this subject has been
    a good reading.<br />Thanks in advance for your help. Regards.... Victor.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I have just read your book on deploying ZBF and was a
    great read. Really helped to break down ZBF for me so thanks. <br /><br />One
    thing I noticed is your method for all out traffic to be inspected (listing 3-5)
    says <br />policy-map type inspect InsideToOutside<br />   class class-default<br
    />      inspect<br /><br />I am using that latest release of IOS 15.1(4)m and
    it seems that you can no longer use inspect on the class-default anymore.<br /><br
    />rtr(config-pmap)# class class-default<br />rtr(config-pmap-c)#  inspect<br />%Action
    inspect cannot be added to class-default<br /><br />Just wondering what you recommend
    in place of this? Was thinking to use a class map inspect for tcp,udp,icmp.<br
    /><br />Thanks

  html: Weird. The workaround would be to create a class that matches TCP, UDP or
    ICMP.<br /><br />Not sure whether you&#39;d have to put FTP/SIP in a separate
    class to ensure ZBF does deep(er) packet inspection.
