Follow the links in the first NOTE in this IP Corner article: http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/RouterDNS/ for more information.<br /><br />IOS is a forwarding, but not a recursive DNS server. BTW, I&#39;m using this functionality in my home office and never had any IPv4 issues (and I&#39;m doing some pretty crazy testing stuff every now and then). IPv6 is unfortunately a completely different story.",
