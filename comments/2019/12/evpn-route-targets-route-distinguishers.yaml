  html: If I&#39;m not mistaken, some existing merchant ASICs support only a single
    VXLAN VNI per bridge table and require/enforce these on both ingress and egress
    tunnels for L2.  At a minimum it&#39;s a limitation of the SDK for these chips.  The
    reason, as I understand it, is that these chips were developed for multicast-based
    flood-and-learn VXLAN which mandates global VXLAN VNI.  EVPN implementations have
    had this to contend with on these chips even though EVPN doesn&#39;t really care
    what the VNIs for a VPN are are so long as they represent the correct bridge table
    contexts that make up the VPN (as we see with EVPN MPLS).  With newer merchant
    ASICs I think locally significant VXLAN VNI for bridge tables are possible.

  html: Hi there, <br /><br />It looks like there is an exception to the EVPN import
    rule based on the RT only if I understood well the (juniper&#39;s at least) implementation
    of &quot;VLAN-Aware Bundle Service Interface&quot; (see RFC 7432 par 6.3 @ https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7432#section-6.3).
    In that case in fact it looks like the route is imported within the right Bridge/Bcast
    Domain (i.e. within the right vlan if we assume a scenario where there is a vlan
    per Bridge domain and there are N Bridge Domanins within the same EVI) within
    the EVI by the import combination of the RT identifying the whole EVI/MAC-VRF
    and the ETHERNET TAG ID field (in the EVPN NLRI of the RT-2 in particular) whose
    value must carry that of the L2VNI (identifying the right bridge/vlan import)
    which in turn must be the same on all PEs for a particular VN in this case I guess.
    <br /><br />Hope it makes sense. It&#39;d be important if anyone could actually
    confirm this as it&#39;s pretty convoluted/complex. As far as I have seen there
    is not even that much public literature around on the implementation of the EVPN
    &quot;VLAN-Aware Bundle Service Interface&quot;.<br /><br />Cheers<br />Andrea

    html: "Thank you Jeff !! I actually remember following your work/discussions @\
      \ Redback when I joined Ericsson in the UK back in 2007-  always great  stuff\
      \ !  <br /><br />Going back to your answer, while it makes absolute sense on\
      \ the forwarding plane, I still have no clear how it can work on the control\
      \ plane at the receiving PE. <br />What I mean is that in an EVPN VLAN-Aware\
      \ Bundle Service Interface scenario with VxLAN control plane, the receiving\
      \ PE has, say, 1 x EVI/MAC-VRF containing N x BDs with one VLAN per BD. If the\
      \ RT-match only identifies the landing EVI/MAC-VRF, how does the receiving PE\
      \ import the received EVPN route in the right BRIDGE/VLAN within the identified\
      \ EVI/MAC-VRF ? does by any chance the RT identify not just the EVI/MAC-VRF\
      \ but actually the BRIDGE/VLAN within the EVI/MAC-VRF ? <br />  <br />On Table\
      \ A1 @ p.237 at the following link [https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/day-one-books/TW_DCDeployment.v2.pdf]\
      \ Juniper seems to have implemented, as I said in the previous reply, a match\
      \ on the RT and on the L2VNI (not on the Ethernet-tag carrying the L2VNI value\
      \ as I said before sorry, my bad) to identify the right BRIDGE/VLAN where to\
      \ import the EVPN route\u2026.<br />"

    html: Hi there,<br /><br />I think I have just understood how it can always work
      with just RT-based import as Jeff was pointing out. Just realised in fact that
      the Route-Target format for the EVPNoVxLAN (RFC 8365) includes a 3B Service
      ID carrying the VNI value in case of VxLAN encapsulation. This means that RT-IMPORT
      allows to import EVPN routes in the right bridge even in a scenario of EVPN
      &quot;VLAN-Aware Bundle Service Interface&quot;. Hope you guys can confirm it.<br
      /><br />This poses now though a further question as this requires the VNI value
      to be globally rather than locally significant I guess ?  <br /><br />Cheers<br
      />Andrea

  html: '@Aldrin in the current incarnation of EVPN implementations it is widely agreed
    that VNI&#39;s are domain unique. While it should indeed be possible to make them
    locally significant, the power of legacy (aka ossification) will not let that
    happen for quite some time ;-)<br />@Andrea - no, the import is still performed
    based on RT, note that every ET-ID within is advertised with its unique VNI and
    has a forwarding entry in the data plane, so when the receiving PE looks up the
    packet, VNI value yields right MAC-VRF+VLAN '

  html: '@Andrea - basically, with VLAN-Aware Bundle Service Interface you&#39;d use
    a single RD/RT per bundle but different VNI&#39;s as per VLAN within the bundle.
    What Juniper is doing is an optimization (RT per VNI), so you could import as
    per VNI.  '
