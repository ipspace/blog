            <div class="comment-content">Not sure why I had this kind of memory:<br />I played with ATM LANE &amp; MPOA a lot something around 2000. It was great to be good at complex expensive &amp; stuff. And sadly this technology disappeared (?) and cheaper <br />technology (which requires less skilled = cheaper) staff won... <br /><br />I do not want to say that BGP is bad  - it is great because skilled man can do a lot with this &#39;Swiss army&#39; knife. <br /><br />Cars do not kill people BUT nobody is skilled enough to prevents accidents. Coordinated actions  - I believe that autonomous cars won&#39;t be autonomous in the sense of road traffic coordination in the future...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Well, I do think Laura has a good point with the car analogy. The huge improvement in car fatalities stats is also caused by big changes in the way how we plan roads. We build safe highways in more places (and this is important, because only around 8% of fatalities happen on highways, as per EU stats). We design city roads very differently, physically forcing drivers to slow down, introducing more car-free zones etc. A lot of things change in the way we organize road infra. The cars also get more of &quot;anti stupid driver&quot; features, but infra changes are more obvious. So that pillar is definetely inportant. <br />The other pillar is regulation - as you mentioned. What is my loss if I misconfigure BGP vs if I drive on red?<br />And I would add one more pillar, which I think might be more relevant today than ever. When we talk about road safety, we accept the fact that people will anyway behave like idiots. Not just drivers (although they too). But e.g. kids who jump on the road. We admit that this behavior can happen, and so we try hard to protect road users also in this case. With BGP, I think, the convention has been that we would deal with (at least somewhat) professional people. It is supposed to be part of the profession not to shoot yourself in the leg badly. We basically say: &quot;If the guy is SO bad, then he shouldn&#39;t be allowed to touch BGP&quot;. Whether this level of expectation was justified or not, I think that it will have to be questioned more than ever NOW, when the leading marketing concept in the industry is: &quot;Everyone can operate the network, because it is self-driven, software-defined, self-healing and super-automated&quot;. Vendors try hard to push the idea that networks will babysit themselves, so a cheap inexperienced network operator will be enough to put the right checkboxes. And with this attitude, shall we expect the number of BGP incidents to go down really?</div>
