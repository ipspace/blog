  html: 'The total convergence time is the sum of the detection time plus BGP state
    propagation delay. The detection time can be easily controlled with BFD while
    propagation requires much more attention, and can be different on BGP implementations
    that we can find in the different devices involved.<br />The strategy I provide
    are the same as in the Petr article referring to BGP PIC: preparing a secondary
    path and minimizing the fault propagation delay. There are also other possibilities
    that fall into the &quot;pe-ce link protection&quot; category for the backbone
    side, that typically represents the most difficult element to optimize (this is
    very specific but can be the subject of a future post). However, the purpose of
    the article is broader because too often the only solution adopted for HA&#39;s
    firewall is Active/Standby with FHRP.<br />And yes, the solution is tested and
    sucessfully adopted with different vendor combinations.'
