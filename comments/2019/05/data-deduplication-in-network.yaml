    html: 'Great comment! Have to add a discussion along these lines to the article.
      Here&#39;s the short version:<br /><br />In the end, you have to agree what
      your unique (node or interface) identifier is going to be - what database people
      would call &quot;primary key&quot;. It can be a UUID, an auto-increasing integer,
      or something that makes sense to you (in my case: hostname).<br /><br />Next
      problem: what happens when the primary key value changes and someone uses it
      in another table? Database people would call this one &quot;referential integrity&quot;.
      Relational databases solve the problem automatically (assuming you declared
      foreign key in the second table).<br /><br />You could also decide that you
      don&#39;t want to deal with referential integrity in which case the only chance
      of remaining consistent is to make sure primary keys never change.<br /><br
      />In the end, you have to decide where your balance between convenience and
      consistency is, and I would go for unique identifiers when working with databases
      fronted by business logic (API, GUI, CLI... or all of the above) and hostnames
      when working with text files.<br /><br />Obviously you&#39;d have to make sure
      your data model has referential integrity even when you work with text files
      - and that&#39;s why I&#39;m always telling engineers attending my Network Automation
      course that they should always validate input data.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br
      />Ivan'

  html: Great article! Thank you for that. Looking for more to come. I find that the
    data model is the most crucial part in automation. Data deduplication and making
    the model flexible for future extension is hard.<br />Your examples still contain
    duplicate date e.g. neighbor name and interface. What if the hostname or interface
    change? You have the data in two places. You&#39;ve traded explicit complexity
    with implicit complexity.

  html: Perfect! Referential integrity is really the key here (in the truest sense
    of the word). Yes one has to made a trade off between convenience and consistency.
    Validating input data is of course very important but may not be sufficient to
    get referential integrity with text files. So only option left is as you stated
    a relational database with UUID and foreign key.
