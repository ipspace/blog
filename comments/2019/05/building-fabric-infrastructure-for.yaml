  html: I agree with Ivan that having OpenStack reach into the switches is asking
    for trouble.<br /><br />AFAIK all commercial OpenStacks require multiple VLANs
    with L2 spanning the cloud so you have to use EVPN in the switches. Then you end
    up using Neutron VXLAN mode to enable self-service. It&#39;s double VXLAN but
    that&#39;s why we have 9216 MTU and at least both of the encapsulation steps are
    (supposed to be) offloaded.
