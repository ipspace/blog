            <div class="comment-content">It&#39;s a moot point, as moral of the story is making good design choices and not having L2 spread wildly all over the place, but, I&#39;ve literally worked on over 200 Catalyst 6500s, with many deployed as core switches in a pair using VSS in Enterprise and Data Center environments and never had any stability issues over several years of software upgrades. In the last 6-7 years, across literally a few hundred Nexus switches, VPC has actually proven to be more unstable, but it&#39;s pretty rock solid if you stick to the Cisco&#39;s official &quot;Recommended Release&quot; which tends to be a couple of major versions behind.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">If L2 is required then the lowest risk involved with a propagation of L2 issues (loops, cpu meltdowns, floods, etc.) is related to the host based overlays. A larger L2 underlay topology, a higher risk related to L2. Still VSS, vPC, MC-LAG or even just xSTP is good enough (read: easy and cheap) if there is a L3 data center interconnect.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I had a customer break their DR site after someone patched in both iLO ports on a server (which are designed to be daisy chained); the switch they were plugged into was part of an EVPN fabric with L2 out to a VMware environment and a management switch, you can probably guess what happened but the broadcast storm propagated through the EVPN fabric, and out the L2 links; killing management and parts of the VMware environment. EVPN does not fix stupidity..</div>
