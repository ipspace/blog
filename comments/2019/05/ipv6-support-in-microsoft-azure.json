      "html": "It&#39;s interesting that they&#39;re able to support IPv6 in Hyper V but not in Azure. Maybe they face problems and therefor are too slow to extend the Azure cloud for IPv6 support although they should have the knowledge and experience. AWS didn&#39;t have IPv6 support when they started.<br />So far you&#39;ve compared AWS and Azure for IPv6 support. What about the other 6 dwarfs?",
