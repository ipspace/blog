            <div class="comment-content">I dont understand why it such a bad thing, networking is all about connectivity, who cares which vendor you choose to get the packet from A to B, as long as you make use of proven protocols and read about the best practices with those protocols; BGP, MPLS, IPSEC, STATIC, you can troubleshoot it and make use of different vendors. Just dont overcomplicated your network with application based loadbalancing and all those shenanigans. Keep it simple!! I like Juniper, Fortinet, Cisco, (insert vendor) and havent had any real problems with any of them, because i think you should keep networks clean and simple. If you want to use Route Reflectors and confederations inside a network of 10 backbone routers and also believe that you should run nuage or viptela at the edges of your network because you believe this is the right way to segment and automate your network... go ahead, but i think your missing some wires. </div>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Forgive me for a delusional dream here, but do you think that this problem leaves any space for a vendor to provide an &#39;open&#39; solution. I appreciate that lock-in = bigger dividends but surely there is a gap to cut out the proprietary mechanisms? Perhaps it is too easy and the vendors know they could make their products interoperate but choose not to.</p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly that proprietary is unlikely a problem today, but will be a headache tomorrow. Isn&#39;t it commonplace for voluntary lock in though? Which baffles me as we are still using OSPF &amp; BGP today and not EIGRP...</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Forgetting the &quot;Lock-in ... ? ... Profit&quot; mentality (see also: Southpark Gnomes), we&#39;re pretty early in the technology evolution curve, and until we can agree what we need (and every vendor is pulling SD-WAN into a totally different direction), it&#39;s hard to standardize anything.</p>

<p>Will standardization happens? Like in traditional networking, only if the end-users start screaming and delay purchases (aka: vote with your wallet). It&#39;s nice to think that Ethernet and IP were around since forever, but some of us still remember the days of Arcnet, Token Ring, FDDI, proprietary stuff... and SNA, DECnet, AppleTalk, IPX... It took a very long time to get rid of all that baroque richness (and job security might or might not have been involved).</p>
