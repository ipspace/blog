  html: 'Hi Ivan,<br />multiple frameworks / tools already exist, such as:<br />-
    NSX-T for Java: https://code.vmware.com/web/sdk/2.3/nsx-t-java<br />- NSX-T for
    Python: https://code.vmware.com/web/sdk/2.3/nsx-t-python<br />- NSX-T Terraform
    Provider: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/nsxt/index.html<br />- PowerCLI:
    http://cloudmaniac.net/powercli-nsx-t-module/<br /><br />Also, the NSX-T API is
    described in an OpenAPI format, and as such you can download easily as a Postman
    Collection (here: http://cloudmaniac.net/nsx-t-api-embedded-documentation-and-postman-collection/).<br
    /><br />I hope this can help.<br />Romain'

  html: I have done a LOT of automation with NSX-T in the past year and a half using
    VMware&#39;s vRA/vRO, python with REST, and their direct python libraries listed
    above.  Each have their pros and cons but overall this is very do-able.  I prefer
    the python w/REST approach over powercli, but that is just me.

  html: 'Just want to get back in this after being involved in several projects with
    NSX-T this year, I would like to add to the list that Romain provided the Ansible
    module page: https://github.com/vmware/ansible-for-nsxt.<br /><br />In my experience
    you can use any of those but the more flexible (not necessarily the most easy)
    approach is to do dev against the API (and the OpenAPI that NSX-T provides is
    AMAZING) instead of being tied to the SDKs, but as you also comment is good to
    &quot;not reinvent the wheel&quot;, meaning that you should be aware of the tools
    and their scope and just develop the things that are missing or complex chaining
    of them to fulfill your use case.<br /><br />my 2c<br /><br />KR,<br />AL'
