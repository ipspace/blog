            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;m running a Poc of IP Fabric https://ipfabric.io/ on a campus network with &gt;200 switches. Their multivendor validation engine does exactly what you describe, it runs show commands and verify the status. We noticed a few switch misconfigurations in a matter of minutes.<br /><br />From some initial tests I had a positive feedback and their dev team added features and fixed some minor issues in a few days. Try that with $BIG_VENDOR products, they always need a business case from a $BIG_CUSTOMER to engage the dev team.<br /><br />For a very specific need, like validating and maintaining a campus network, huge NMS/IBN tools may not be the best solutions. It may be worth investing some time looking for less mainstream products that solve real problems without major investments.<br /><br />Or write your own script if you have the skills and the time to maintain it ;-)<br /><br />Software is the only thing you buy knowing it will be flawed and you can&#39;t expect the vendor to fix. If it is broken it is the buyer&#39;s right to demand that it be repaired, it&#39;s valid for everything but software.</div>
