I&#39;d be particularly interested on how you overcome this challenge? </p>\n\n<p>So far we managed to use Ansible &quot;assert&quot; module to peer check for common object naming errors deviating from our standards (regex statements), but its obviously not enough. \nSecond you could have Staging (replica of Prod) network to ensure the change gets accepted by APIC and delivers desired outcome, however there are still limitations subject to how big/complex your network is (hard to replicate routing, but perhaps its easy to ensure EPG name gets installed into APIC).</p>\n",
