      "html": "So people realised software packet switching is slow and want to offload it to the hardware. History repeats itself. ;-)<br /><br />Actually software packet switching is not that slow. For many server-based workloads it may be &quot;good enough&quot; to overprovision 2 CPU cores more for network handling than to buy a smart NIC. I would like to see benchmarks and pricing.<br /><br />We do 100Gbit DDoS scrubbing on x86 platform purely in software and try not to rely on NIC advanced features. I second Luke&#39;s &quot;dumb NIC&quot; idea because it reduces complexity.",
