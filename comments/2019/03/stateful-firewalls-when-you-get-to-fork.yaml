    html: Thanks for the hints. Wasn&#39;t the debate about stateless or stateful
      firewalls? Because with reflexive ACLs you have to maintain a state. I thought
      that stateless firewalls (router ACLs) would scale.

    html: Hey, you&#39;re right - missed that bit. Apologize for that.<br /><br />Microsegmentation
      done right or security groups available in AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenStack are stateful.
      The real reason they scale is because they&#39;re implemented at the edge (in
      compute infrastructure - hypervisors). Have to write another blog post on the
      topic ;)

    html: 'And even their scale has limitations. Take AWS for example: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html
      look under Network ACLs and Security Groups. I don&#39;t think every firewall
      guy would be happy about those limits :D'

  html: Doesn&#39;t a device/system with a reflexive ACL capability maintain some
    sort of state? How do the $cloud_providers handle that state?

  html: 'It get&#39;s even funnier when an enterprise implements micro segmentation,
    assuming the &quot;contracts&quot; aren&#39;t of the allow any any to everywhere
    type, and still insists on pushing _all_ traffic through physical firewall clusters
    for inspection, having to break open all encrypted traffic in the process. And
    let&#39;s not forget the fact that your typical enterprise cluster technology
    sucks, especially if it&#39;s a two member cluster (split brain anyone?) and/or
    $deity forbid a stretched variation.<br />If there&#39;s only 1 thing you&#39;re
    going to pick from cloudy architectures, at least think about loosely coupled
    individual components: small failure domains/blast zones (data/control _and_ config
    domains). It might involve a bit more thinking, but deploying (at least) two individual
    L3 connected components beats any cluster technology in my view. Granted, depending
    on your L3 design, for firewalls you might need some state/session syncing, but
    that&#39;s fundamentally a far less complex issue.<br />'

  html: The thing we&#39;ve been struggling with, as you hinted in the post, is the
    Security team wanting every feature in the world to be in front of every application.
    The whole &quot;no-trust&quot; thing has really taken hold and they want scrubbing,
    sandboxing, A/V, etc in front and in-between even layer of the application. And
    the firewall vendors are really drumming up the FUD and Infosec dept are really
    drinking that cool-aid.<br /><br />It is so hard to work through and it just makes
    things so much more complicated than it needs to.

  html: I don&#39;t see any reasons to put NGFW or classic Stateful L3/4 firewall
    in front of 3-tiers application as those devices just add unnecessary latency
    and can&#39;t provide Multi-Terabit  bandwidth that are necessary for East-West
    traffic in the DC .i once checked the Firepower Oracle IPS rules ( they are basically
    snort rules) and 90% of those rules are about the buffer overflow of older oracle
    versions that simply can be ignored if you regularly patch your oracle software.i
    think the best place to place the NGFW/Stateful firewalls are North-South traffics
    and for East-West it is better to add visibility via IDS sensors and Flow-Based
    monitoring tools to detect a breach.i like the idea of ARISTA DirectFlow assist
    (offload some traffic from FW and let the Switch handle it) . maybe someone argue
    about the fragmented traffic can bypass the stateless ACLs but  simply deny any
    fragment packets via ACLs and use the TCP Flags filtering via extended ACLs can
    mitigate the risk.the only problem with stateless ACLs is the number of rules
    could be more than ACLs on stateful firewall as you need to handle the returning
    traffic (also can be mitigated with ESTABLISHED statement on ACL).i don&#39;t
    like the reflexive ACLs as they put to much tax on TCAM for some older devices
    like C6500 and can easily overwhelm TCAM with just a few ACL.there are some vendors
    claim that their FW used some sort of NP/ASIC to handle multi-gigiabit traffics
    without any performance penalty but again when some further inspection for some
    L3/4 traffic needed they handle that types of traffic via software.i see that
    firewall with NP/ASIC can only handle 30% of traffic in hardware and the remains
    punt to the CPU for inspection.<br />Thanks you Ivan to shed some light on this
    topic.
