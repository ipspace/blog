  html: "I use netmiko together with a flask framework with jinja2 templating. I have\
    \ build a portal in javascript (should convert it to vue.js), which will ask the\
    \ user to configure certain options, this could be an entire site, or just options\
    \ like HSRP, BGP or an interface, it&#39;s all up to user what options they want\
    \ to configure (could be all at once, or just one at a time). <br /><br />In the\
    \ background i have created python functions for each of these options. Based\
    \ on the options the user wants to configure it needs to fill in certain values.\
    \ These values are transformed into key/value pairs which can then be used in\
    \ a jinja2 template to create the device configuration.<br /><br />With netmiko\
    \ you can just add these conf files as a variable to netmiko and send this configuration\
    \ file over ssh to the device. <br /><br />The funny thing is, I tried this with\
    \ netconf as this was to supposed the best next thing, but there are no generic\
    \ yang templates which covers every vendor. Ofcourse you can do very generic stuff,\
    \ but if you want to create a good device configuration you are bound to the specific\
    \ yang models which the vendor is offering, and what you are then actually doing\
    \ is converting the CLI of the vendor to XML\u2026 <br />"
