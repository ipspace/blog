  html: 'I dont understand why it such a bad thing, networking is all about connectivity,
    who cares which vendor you choose to get the packet from A to B, as long as you
    make use of proven protocols and read about the best practices with those protocols;
    BGP, MPLS, IPSEC, STATIC, you can troubleshoot it and make use of different vendors.
    Just dont overcomplicated your network with application based loadbalancing and
    all those shenanigans. Keep it simple!! I like Juniper, Fortinet, Cisco, (insert
    vendor) and havent had any real problems with any of them, because i think you
    should keep networks clean and simple. If you want to use Route Reflectors and
    confederations inside a network of 10 backbone routers and also believe that you
    should run nuage or viptela at the edges of your network because you believe this
    is the right way to segment and automate your network... go ahead, but i think
    your missing some wires. '
