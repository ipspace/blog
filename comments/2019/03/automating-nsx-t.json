      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br />multiple frameworks / tools already exist, such as:<br />- NSX-T for Java: https://code.vmware.com/web/sdk/2.3/nsx-t-java<br />- NSX-T for Python: https://code.vmware.com/web/sdk/2.3/nsx-t-python<br />- NSX-T Terraform Provider: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/nsxt/index.html<br />- PowerCLI: http://cloudmaniac.net/powercli-nsx-t-module/<br /><br />Also, the NSX-T API is described in an OpenAPI format, and as such you can download easily as a Postman Collection (here: http://cloudmaniac.net/nsx-t-api-embedded-documentation-and-postman-collection/).<br /><br />I hope this can help.<br />Romain",

Each have their pros and cons but overall this is very do-able.  I prefer the python w/REST approach over powercli, but that is just me.",
