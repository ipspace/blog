            <div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks, we use similar approach in our environment (we also use AWX for audit and WorkFlow visualization), however the biggest challenge we face is variable preparation and peer review process before committing variables to Git. I&#39;d be particularly interested on how you overcome this challenge? </p>

<p>So far we managed to use Ansible &quot;assert&quot; module to peer check for common object naming errors deviating from our standards (regex statements), but its obviously not enough. 
Second you could have Staging (replica of Prod) network to ensure the change gets accepted by APIC and delivers desired outcome, however there are still limitations subject to how big/complex your network is (hard to replicate routing, but perhaps its easy to ensure EPG name gets installed into APIC).</p>
