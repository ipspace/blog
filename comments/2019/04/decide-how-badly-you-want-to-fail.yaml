  html: I particularly enjoy seeing what happens when applications that are designed
    to be intra-datacenter adjacent but are split for DR purposes start to experience
    latency, jitter, and loss.  A WAN emulator is a fun tool to have when testing
    things like this.

  html: 'I&#39;m a big fan of testing new deployments (whenever possible) where everybody
    relies on those stretched VLANs over hundreds of miles. Power off all the switches
    on one site and enjoy the party :D So 100 percent agreeing: only testing in real
    life will give you certainty. All those assumptions are worthless. There are too
    many dependencies which no one could even imagine.'
