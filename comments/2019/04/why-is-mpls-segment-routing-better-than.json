          "html": "In a single routing domain you&#39;d still need one label for every next hop on every switch in the network... and if you get beyond a few thousand devices then the SR fans will quickly point out you can use a controller that pushes label stacks into ingress nodes (or a gazillion other combinations of slightly-misused protocols).<br /><br />However, if you have a problem of that size, you might get better results by involving someone who did it before as opposed to collecting random tidbits from blogs and videos :D",

However...<br /><br />#1: Obviously you found them, so that\u2019s not a big deal (and I prefer having an intelligent conversation with fellow engineers over vanity metrics anyway)<br /><br />#2: When you figure out how to make Big Bucks with niche technology videos please let me (and dozens of others) know. There\u2019s a bit of a difference between spouting opinions and nonsense and getting millions of followers and creating technical content that gets a few hundred views.<br /><br />#3: What happened to \u201cI liked them\u201d or \u201cYou got it all wrong\u201d or whatever instead of complaining about your pet inconvenience?<br /><br />Enjoy the weekend!
