  html: Usual practice/recommendation tho is to push logic outside of templates files
    (erb for ruby/chef automation and J2 for python/ansible) into separate helper
    modules. That way processing of incoming data such as filtering, enrichment and
    so on, can be tested and modified outside of the template body and used by several
    templates.
