      "html": "When it comes to REST API over objects in a network device config, yes, your TL;DR is correct. NetConf is a bit better from that point of view. <br />But, again, if you are configuring some service that spans over multiple devices, you still fall into the same trap of distributed transaction.

Meaning, a REST API is transactional, there just is no session state saved between the transactions. You may not like the scope of the transaction, but in my understanding that is a different question.<br /><br />Again, this does not solve the problem, just hoping to agree on taxonomy, as it is important to ensure we can all communicate these complex topics.",
