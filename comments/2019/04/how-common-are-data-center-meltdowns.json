Now for a more interesting one...<br /><br />Obviously Type-A organizations will gladly continue failing and blame everyone else... but do you think that Type-B organizations eventually evolve toward a sane applications + infrastructure stack, or do they stay stuck in some well-managed local minimum like &quot;yeah, we have to do long-distance VLANs, but at least they work reasonably well&quot;?",

That is normal. <br /><br />However, human and automated responses to these events and states differ greatly, and are very dependent on the corporate and engineering culture. <br /><br />In places that are quick to assign blame, and look for culprits, this leads to design paralysis of always doing what vendors, consultants, and architects propose. Because, that\u2019s where blame will inevitably end. <br /><br />In places that understand that if humans do work, humans will error, and there will be outages, situation is different. <br /><br />So, what does this have to do with meltdowns? Pretty much everything. <br /><br />Large networks, operated by humans, or human-designed automation will melt down. The real question to ask is not how common these are (they are), rather how common is a repeated visible meltdown. <br /><br />In a case of a first environment I described, I\u2019d be willing to bet it was common. <br /><br />In the second, I am willing to bet it would be close to zero.
