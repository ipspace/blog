            <div class="comment-content">I think your have an infatuation with layer 2.  The problem is noobs hear this then disable spanning tree.  Of course it is going to crash.  If you disable spanning tree you still need a path protection protocol.<br />The biggest problem in data centre meltdowns is poor facilities management.

            <div class="comment-content">When a network is over a certain size (I always maintained that the spot is somewhere between 500 and 750 nodes), something is broken somewhere all the time. That is normal. <br /><br />However, human and automated responses to these events and states differ greatly, and are very dependent on the corporate and engineering culture. <br /><br />In places that are quick to assign blame, and look for culprits, this leads to design paralysis of always doing what vendors, consultants, and architects propose. Because, that’s where blame will inevitably end. <br /><br />In places that understand that if humans do work, humans will error, and there will be outages, situation is different. <br /><br />So, what does this have to do with meltdowns? Pretty much everything. <br /><br />Large networks, operated by humans, or human-designed automation will melt down. The real question to ask is not how common these are (they are), rather how common is a repeated visible meltdown. <br /><br />In a case of a first environment I described, I’d be willing to bet it was common. <br /><br />In the second, I am willing to bet it would be close to zero. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">Thank you. Now for a more interesting one...<br /><br />Obviously Type-A organizations will gladly continue failing and blame everyone else... but do you think that Type-B organizations eventually evolve toward a sane applications + infrastructure stack, or do they stay stuck in some well-managed local minimum like &quot;yeah, we have to do long-distance VLANs, but at least they work reasonably well&quot;?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">That question answers itself, doesn’t it?<br /><br />If B determines that root cause is “unreasonably large L2 domain”, then they would address it. <br /><br />Problem there, again is really not the L2 domain, rather the reason it’s in place, and let’s be frank — it’s VMware, and its historically not-quite-optimal idea of how networks work. <br /><br />3 years ago, I’d sit and argue that’s an unsolvable problem. These days, with things like Kubernetes, hybrid and on-premise clouds, and dare I beat our own drum: Anthos, reasons to rely on ancient concepts of vMotion and VMs are few and far between. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">Oh, I am perfectly aware of that, and see Ivan&#39;s comment above: &quot;evolve toward a sane applications + infrastructure&quot;. That architecture now exists, invalidating the need for &quot;insanity&quot; of globe-spanning L2 domains. <br /><br />The fact people are doing something, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the reasonable thing to do.
