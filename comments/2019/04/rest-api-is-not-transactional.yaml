  html: 'When it comes to REST API over objects in a network device config, yes, your
    TL;DR is correct. NetConf is a bit better from that point of view. <br />But,
    again, if you are configuring some service that spans over multiple devices, you
    still fall into the same trap of distributed transaction. '

  html: Once again, made a similar point on twitter, but for longevity sake...<br
    /><br />My understanding is the headline is not accurate, but the essence of what
    you are saying is. Meaning, a REST API is transactional, there just is no session
    state saved between the transactions. You may not like the scope of the transaction,
    but in my understanding that is a different question.<br /><br />Again, this does
    not solve the problem, just hoping to agree on taxonomy, as it is important to
    ensure we can all communicate these complex topics.
