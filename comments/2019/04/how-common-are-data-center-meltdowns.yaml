      and tell me what it look like.

    html: Facilities failures are so 2005.  Nowadays, organizations are building redundancy
      models at the datacenter level.<br /><br />Ivan&#39;s perspective on layer-2
      networking is dead on.  Layer-2 fabric tech is for suckers who don&#39;t know
      how to tell developers their ideas are dumb.

    this then disable spanning tree.  Of course it is going to crash.  If you disable
    spanning tree you still need a path protection protocol.<br />The biggest problem
    in data centre meltdowns is poor facilities management.  People don&#39;t do the
    work right:  https://www.iotforall.com/doing-data-center-work-right-checklist/'

    html: Thank you. Now for a more interesting one...<br /><br />Obviously Type-A
      organizations will gladly continue failing and blame everyone else... but do
      you think that Type-B organizations eventually evolve toward a sane applications
      + infrastructure stack, or do they stay stuck in some well-managed local minimum
      like &quot;yeah, we have to do long-distance VLANs, but at least they work reasonably
      well&quot;?

    html: "That question answers itself, doesn\u2019t it?<br /><br />If B determines\
      \ that root cause is \u201Cunreasonably large L2 domain\u201D, then they would\
      \ address it. <br /><br />Problem there, again is really not the L2 domain,\
      \ rather the reason it\u2019s in place, and let\u2019s be frank \u2014 it\u2019\
      s VMware, and its historically not-quite-optimal idea of how networks work.\
      \ <br /><br />3 years ago, I\u2019d sit and argue that\u2019s an unsolvable\
      \ problem. These days, with things like Kubernetes, hybrid and on-premise clouds,\
      \ and dare I beat our own drum: Anthos, reasons to rely on ancient concepts\
      \ of vMotion and VMs are few and far between. "

    html: 'Oh, I am perfectly aware of that, and see Ivan&#39;s comment above: &quot;evolve
      toward a sane applications + infrastructure&quot;. That architecture now exists,
      invalidating the need for &quot;insanity&quot; of globe-spanning L2 domains.
      <br /><br />The fact people are doing something, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the
      reasonable thing to do. After all: people smoke.'

  html: "When a network is over a certain size (I always maintained that the spot\
    \ is somewhere between 500 and 750 nodes), something is broken somewhere all the\
    \ time. That is normal. <br /><br />However, human and automated responses to\
    \ these events and states differ greatly, and are very dependent on the corporate\
    \ and engineering culture. <br /><br />In places that are quick to assign blame,\
    \ and look for culprits, this leads to design paralysis of always doing what vendors,\
    \ consultants, and architects propose. Because, that\u2019s where blame will inevitably\
    \ end. <br /><br />In places that understand that if humans do work, humans will\
    \ error, and there will be outages, situation is different. <br /><br />So, what\
    \ does this have to do with meltdowns? Pretty much everything. <br /><br />Large\
    \ networks, operated by humans, or human-designed automation will melt down. The\
    \ real question to ask is not how common these are (they are), rather how common\
    \ is a repeated visible meltdown. <br /><br />In a case of a first environment\
    \ I described, I\u2019d be willing to bet it was common. <br /><br />In the second,\
    \ I am willing to bet it would be close to zero. "
