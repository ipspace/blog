  html: Maybe I missed something... How to integrate the Faucet with the app and program
    new flow(s) on specific device(s)? Is there NBI? I mean that high level abstraction
    / logic delivered by the app and the SDN controller only program the devices through
    SBI (actually OpenFlow here). And interesting thing how long does it take to program
    and use new flows...<br />

  html: New Flows are pushing more or less in real time. Everything is programmed
    using OpenFlow 1.3 directly from the controller(s). There is middleware that converts
    the flowmods to routes and vice verse. Code can be found here https://github.com/wandsdn/sc18-ansible
    and https://github.com/wandsdn/sc18-faucet-configs
