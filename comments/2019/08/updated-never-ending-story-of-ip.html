            <div class="comment-content">Huge topic, nobody likes it, but difficult to avoid this (I am facing it for last 26 years of my life).<br /><br />Maybe you will find it interesting:<br /><br />- Multicasts and PMTUD - not sure if anything has changed since I last touched the topic (the big multicast packet is silently dropped w/o sending back any ICMP message and it was as RFC stated) and we need to fragment the multicast packets<br /><br />-if fragmentation is required on the tunnel we can either fragment inner (before encapsulation) or outer packets (encapsulated)- consequences are different. <br />When inner packet is fragmented the endpoint can reassemble the packets; when outer packet is fragmented the other side of the tunnel is reponsible for it as we need to reassemble packet before de-encapsulating it<br /><br />- when fragmenting multicast packets - can the endpoint host reassemble them? Always?<br /><br />- implementation matters and all the kludges vendor have for this <br /><br />- etc</div>
