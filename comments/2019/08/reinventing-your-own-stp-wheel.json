That&#39;s a shame because IP mobility is delightfully easy and works for almost all network traffic.  (the most common exception is multicast &amp; broadcast traffic traffic like heartbeats and discovery protocols -- those still require full LAN extension)",

Also, the first attempt at this had pairs of boxes at each site driving a single etherip link between them, which made it hard for STP to do something useful.<br /><br />The current setup has been very robust. I&#39;m just sorry to have upset you by showing an intermediate step while I was learning some hard lessons.",
