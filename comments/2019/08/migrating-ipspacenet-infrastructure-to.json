Terraform for infrastructure deployment (declarative) and Ansible for configuring your VMs (imperative). You&#39;ll get the most out of them. You could treat your Terraform configuration files as code with all the added benefits like version control for example.",

Also, rebuilding and restarting the VM every time I&#39;m deploying new code is a bit tedious, not to mention I&#39;d have to go for a back-end database and front-end load balancer to have reasonable availability.<br /><br />As for &quot;to Ansible or not to Ansible&quot; - yeah, I could do everything with Bash scripts as most things Ansible modules use (like yum, pip, cpan...) are idempotent anyway, but when you have a shiny new hammer lying on a bench nearby...<br /><br />Finally, have to look into lambda details, but I have a nasty feeling that moving to serverless would trigger a major code rewrite, so it would be more hassle than it would be worth. For new stuff however...",
