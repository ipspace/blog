    html: I always thought you don&#39;t need a MAC address per interface (just one
      per box) in a bridge.

    html: The impression I get from the spec is that each individual port has a MAC
      address. The bridge has one too, but may reuse the MAC address from one of the
      ports if it wants.

    html: The way I read section 8.13.2, there MUST be a MAC address per MAC Service
      (= bridge, see section 6.2) and there COULD be a MAC address per bridge port
      which COULD be used for outgoing frames UNLESS specified otherwise.<br /><br
      />However, I think we should move this discussion to email. Remi knows how to
      get in touch with me (and I&#39;m guessing you know how to get in touch with
      Remi ;).

  html: 'OpenBSD has support for STP. It&#39;s part of the bridge implementation.
    The manual for OpenBSDs bridge explains why STP does not work with etherip pseudo
    interfaces: they lack a hardware MAC address (http://man.openbsd.org/bridge).<br
    /><br />There is a continuation to that story here: https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&amp;m=156445794826074&amp;w=2'

    html: Thanks for the feedback... and yes, FEXes (and rbridges and LAN extenders
      and a gazillion similar kludges) should never have been invented.<br /><br />Also,
      I always appreciate people documenting the failures - that&#39;s the only way
      for everyone to learn and move forward without repeating the same mistakes.

    html: FEX&#39;s always block spanning-tree packets (BPDUs).<br /><br />Too many
      network designers think LAN extension is the only way to do IP mobility. That&#39;s
      a shame because IP mobility is delightfully easy and works for almost all network
      traffic.  (the most common exception is multicast &amp; broadcast traffic traffic
      like heartbeats and discovery protocols -- those still require full LAN extension)

  html: (A) is not true, (B) is not true, (C) is true, (D) is quite likely, and (E)
    is definitely true.<br /><br />FWIW, one side of this link was going into FEXes
    on Cisco Nexus kit, and they don&#39;t appear to like doing spanning tree out
    the front of those ports. Also, the first attempt at this had pairs of boxes at
    each site driving a single etherip link between them, which made it hard for STP
    to do something useful.<br /><br />The current setup has been very robust. I&#39;m
    just sorry to have upset you by showing an intermediate step while I was learning
    some hard lessons.
