  html: Huge topic, nobody likes it, but difficult to avoid this (I am facing it for
    last 26 years of my life).<br /><br />Maybe you will find it interesting:<br /><br
    />- Multicasts and PMTUD - not sure if anything has changed since I last touched
    the topic (the big multicast packet is silently dropped w/o sending back any ICMP
    message and it was as RFC stated) and we need to fragment the multicast packets<br
    /><br />-if fragmentation is required on the tunnel we can either fragment inner
    (before encapsulation) or outer packets (encapsulated)- consequences are different.
    <br />When inner packet is fragmented the endpoint can reassemble the packets;
    when outer packet is fragmented the other side of the tunnel is reponsible for
    it as we need to reassemble packet before de-encapsulating it<br /><br />- when
    fragmenting multicast packets - can the endpoint host reassemble them? Always?<br
    /><br />- implementation matters and all the kludges vendor have for this <br
    /><br />- etc
