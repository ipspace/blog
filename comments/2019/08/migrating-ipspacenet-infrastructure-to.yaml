  html: You&#39;re right, Ansible is slow and specifically with high latency connections
    , but maybe you can speedup your deployment with  https://github.com/dw/mitogen

    html: Yeah, I should replace my Bash scripts using AWS CLI with Terraform. Lesson
      learned ;)

  html: I think you really miss a chance here. You should use both Terraform and Ansible.
    Terraform for infrastructure deployment (declarative) and Ansible for configuring
    your VMs (imperative). You&#39;ll get the most out of them. You could treat your
    Terraform configuration files as code with all the added benefits like version
    control for example.

    html: While I agree that it would be great to use immutable deployments, it&#39;s
      probably an overkill for my single VM environment (don&#39;t need anything more
      sophisticated for the current workload). Also, rebuilding and restarting the
      VM every time I&#39;m deploying new code is a bit tedious, not to mention I&#39;d
      have to go for a back-end database and front-end load balancer to have reasonable
      availability.<br /><br />As for &quot;to Ansible or not to Ansible&quot; - yeah,
      I could do everything with Bash scripts as most things Ansible modules use (like
      yum, pip, cpan...) are idempotent anyway, but when you have a shiny new hammer
      lying on a bench nearby...<br /><br />Finally, have to look into lambda details,
      but I have a nasty feeling that moving to serverless would trigger a major code
      rewrite, so it would be more hassle than it would be worth. For new stuff however...

  html: 'Better yet, use immutable deployments and deploy AMIs as an artifact, not
    code onto existing set of EC2s.<br /><br />Major win and you can dump all of ansible
    since you don&#39;t need ansible to deploy to a single server.<br /><br />Major
    major win: serverless all the things and then you don&#39;t need anything beyond
    SAM. :)'
