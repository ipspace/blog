I read those articles from your link, ok, some vulnerabilities mentioned. What is the alternative? Is there any secure product without such vulnerabilities? Oh, they found vulnerability in API, but stop, didn&#39;t we have the same API vulnerability on Cisco recently? Default SNMP community Public for RO - seriously?

Sometimes it helps to take a step back: What is the difference between a sopgisticated hybrid WAN solution and an SD-WAN? Could one do a spohisticated hybrid network without using SD-WAN? No separation of data plane and control plane, no central orchestrator? The answer is a simple yes. So it is not SD-WAN that provides those features, it is the edge device. And if there is some &quot;intellegence&quot; built into the edge device and the edge device supports hybrid WAN, then it is entirely possible to achieve the same thing without any need for SD-WAN. Network optimization using a set of different technologies is not anything new, FEC is nothing new, hybrid network is nothing new, load balancing is nothing new. Inline monitoring is not anything new. <br />Sending the same packets over a different links to figure out which one is the best, only gives you relyable information for that instant. Sending the same packets over multiple lines consistently is an obvious waste of bandwith.<br /><br />In terms of security, I pointed to two publicly available resources.

Security is part of a product and delivered to a large extent by products. For starters: It is quite riky to run all processes with root access. If you don&#39;t separate encryption from reouting you have an inherent problem. Encryption requires secure keys, i.e. a proper key management system. The SD-WAN products I saw and looked at in more detail did for sure not excel in terms of key management system. Some have a level tat would have been acceptable in 2010, but that is not OK since 2012. I respect NDAs (contrary to some vendors), so I will not go public with details concerning those vendors. I am restricted to point at other sources.<br />Decent network encryption equipment is not available from mainstream vendors. It also seems news to most people that network encryption includes firewall functionalities at the native layer (process, bypass, drop). There is equipment out there that is secure and provides a high level of security and doesn&#39;t need contant patches or unplanned maintenance windows. You might just not be familiar with it.<br />",

There are different classes of networkw encryption solutions that addres different requiremnts. There are vendors that put their priority on time-to-market, performance and cost, while there are vendors that put their priority on security, longevity and performance. Currently, the latter are predominantly used for classified governement data use and for critical infrastructures. However, an increasing number of enterprise customers realizes the cost (TCO) and operational benefits of solutions designed for security, longevity and performance.<br />For the current state of SD-WAN security you might also want to have a look at this: https://github.com/sdnewhop/sdwannewhope/blob/master/slides/securityfest-2019.pdf<br />",

         "html": "@Vladimir<br />Thales e-Security is in a transitional phase as Thales has acquired Gemalto and is restructuring the e-Security portfolio as part of an organizational restructureing. <br />I agree that there is no 100% security. In terms of Datacryptor 5000 Thales cannot forget anything in their product, especially not certificates. The Datacryptor 5000 does not use certificates and is built on the Atmedia platform.<br />Network security is one security layer and for those transits covered vy it, it also covers for shortcomings in application security. The more code and the more dependencies, the lower the probabiliy of a high level of security. When looking at network encryption the objective is to have a secure device using secure algorithms and interacting with secure devices. That is much more of a challenge than one would assume. One has to really dig deep to understand network encryption systems and how they are implemented in order to make a reasonable security assessment. Some vendors are cooperative, other less so, and mostly with good reason.",

Applying it in the outbound direction changes the route selection <strong>on the other end of the link</strong> (but it still works because it&#39;s just two routers, two links, and IBGP, so LocPref is propagated).</p>\n\n<p>As for &quot;working between Cisco and Juniper&quot;: if you influence local route selection, then it doesn&#39;t matter what else you&#39;re using (by definition), if you&#39;re using Local Preference to influence remote route selection then it will always work within the same autonomous system (because that&#39;s how BGP works).</p>\n",
