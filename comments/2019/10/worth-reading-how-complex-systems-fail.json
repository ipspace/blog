      "html": "Yes, this is kind of generalized conclusion from what we can see dealing with such systems (I am mostly experienced with rather complex voice &amp; data mobile systems and also agree with this summary).<br /><br />The other part is much more interesting to me: how to troubleshoot such complex failures. We all know, for example, that complex issues often as a result of coincidence of a few sub-issues but finding the root cause isn&#39;t easy ).<br /><br />Maybe this could be a part of the NEW System Troubleshooting Blog Series, Ivan?<br />Why? Because I believe that troubleshooting is crucial part of our job, if not most important one. You need to fail to learn (at least at the beginning)<br /><br />",
