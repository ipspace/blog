      "html": "There is actually some crazy math behind the magic number 1500.<br /><br />As per IEEE 802, clause 6.2, for wired physical media, the probability that an MAC service data unit (MSDU) delivered at an MSAP contains an undetected error, due to operation of the MAC service provider, shall be less than 5\u00d710^-14 per octet of MSDU length. CRC32 function used in Ethernet for calculating FCS field gives accurate error detection with frames up to 91639 bits (with minimum Hamming distance between any two valid frames of 4), and 3 or less bit errors. Given the bit error rate/probability, the desired damaged frame detection probability for a frame of certain length, and possible frame lengths, the calculated optimum frame length is around that famous 1500.<br /><br />For example, the worst-case probability of losing a 65536-octet frame is to be less than 1.21\u00d710^-4, or approximately 1 in 8250. The worst-case probability that a similar frame, which contains an MSDU of 1500 octets, is delivered with an undetected error is to be less than 7.5\u00d710^-11, or approximately 1 in 13 300 000 000.<br /><br />Interestingly, there is huge loss of CRC32 error detection efficiency with frames longer than 91640 bits. This is why most vendors allowed jumbo frames only up to 9k, even before it was standartized.",
