  html: Mellanox is developing an open-source driver for their Spectrum ASIC https://github.com/mellanox/mlxsw/wiki
    although I don&#39;t know of any NOSes that use it; I guess their traditional
    SDK is ahead on features.<br /><br />For open-source-ish NOSes I guess you&#39;re
    down to Cumulus which is a product or SONIC which may be &quot;more open&quot;
    but doesn&#39;t seem to be commercially supported. In PCs and servers it was a
    big deal to get a more advanced OS for $0, but switches are not free and most
    people don&#39;t just have them lying around so a free-but-unsupported product
    has less appeal.

  html: The ASIC NDA issue remains, but there is the Facebook et al&#39;s Open Compute
    Project (OCP) and Open Switching System (FBOSS). Interesting in it&#39;s own way
    if you&#39;re brave :)

  html: An underappreciate factor in whitebox switches is the platform layer. There
    is no standard for how to spin fans, poll SFPs or flash LEDs. Every switch requires
    device drivers for the platform, even without the ASIC. Cumulus (my employer)
    spends a lot of time on this. If you look at the ONL platform drivers it&#39;s
    almost all OCP switches, since the specs are public for people to build FOSS drivers
    for. If the specs aren&#39;t public then you have to work directly with the switch
    vendor to figure out how to turn the thing on in the first place. The boring stuff
    turns out to be the most complicated in whitebox land.
