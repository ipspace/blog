I would suggest you read this first https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID and then tell me which of the REST APIs provides that across multiple calls.<br /><br />You might also want to read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer, in particular the &quot;statelessness&quot; part.<br /><br />Finally, compare what you have to do to recover from a failed configuration of a network device with &quot;commit&quot; capabilities with what you have to do if you&#39;re using REST API. <br /><br />I wrote about that in https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/04/rest-api-is-not-transactional.html and https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/09/infrastructure-as-code-netconf-and-rest.html... but the of course it&#39;s much faster to write a comment saying &quot;this problem has been solved, what are you complaining about?&quot;",

      "html": "Well...The whole world outside network engineer&#39;s mind is mostly built on REST API (public clouds, k8s, etc), and moreover, embracing microservices will make it even more microservices-oriented. <br />The problem you described here has been solved many years ago with maintaining sessions state (cookies, sessions tokens, transaction ids  etc). If any particular implementation of API interface lacks that, it&#39;s not a problem of REST API as a whole.<br />On the other hand, can you imagine you make 5 independent changes in the DB, or 10 changes in your aws (or whatever else) environment without influencing the system state. No, it doesn&#39;t work this way.<br /><br />So splitting your network changes in  multiple parts, applying them, checking system state after each step can also this &quot;problem&quot; of non-transational REST",
