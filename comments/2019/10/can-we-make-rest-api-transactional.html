            <div class="comment-content">Well...The whole world outside network engineer&#39;s mind is mostly built on REST API (public clouds, k8s, etc), and moreover, embracing microservices will make it even more microservices-oriented. <br />The problem you described here has been solved many years ago with maintaining sessions state (cookies, sessions tokens, transaction ids  etc). If any particular implementation of API interface lacks that, it&#39;s not a problem of REST API as a whole.<br />On the other hand, can you imagine you make 5 independent changes in the DB, or 10 changes in your aws (or whatever else) environment without influencing the system state. No, it doesn&#39;t work this way.<br /><br />So splitting your network changes in  multiple parts, applying them, checking system state after each step can also this &quot;problem&quot; of non-transational REST</div>

            <div class="comment-content">You&#39;re confusing session management and transactions. I would suggest you read this first https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID and then tell me which of the REST APIs provides that across multiple calls.<br /><br />You might also want to read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer, in particular the &quot;statelessness&quot; part.<br /><br />Finally, compare what you have to do to recover from a failed configuration of a network device with &quot;commit&quot; capabilities with what you have to do if you&#39;re using REST API. <br /><br />I wrote about that in https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/04/rest-api-is-not-transactional.html and https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/09/infrastructure-as-code-netconf-and-rest.html... but the of course it&#39;s much faster to write a comment saying &quot;this problem has been solved, what are you complaining about?&quot;</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I read your posts. <br />REST is stateless by definition (not putting wikipedia links here ;)<br />The problem you describe is solved by applications you write (think Cloudformation as an example), which leverage REST API, it is nothing to do with REST API itself. It can be a long discussion though...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">So we&#39;re in perfect agreement. Great!<br /><br />BTW, the subliminal message of this series of blog posts was &quot;we had something like CloudFormation forever... why are some people so keen to see it replaced by REST API&quot; ;)</div>
