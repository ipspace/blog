  html: Interesting there. I recall there&#39;re many attempts to handle the reliability
    aspect at App level. be it with 3GPP / or OTT players. So if  assuming quic evolves
    in DC as transport protocol (HTTP/3 been considered as transport in 5G too) and
    Apps/Workloads are smart enough would end the complexities in our DC overlay/underlay?

  html: 'hello Blake, <br /><br />Thanks for posting this as it&#39;s a really interesting
    piece of research from Mark but I reckon it has little to do with what Ivan was
    talking about which is the TCP/IP model&#39;s lacking of a Session layer. '

    management Ivan ? At least from a multihoming perspective I guess
