            <div class="comment-content">You have to made a trade off between higher priced flight tickets (quality airlines) or your valuable time. Think of what you could do with the wasted time instead (opportunity costs).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I hope I know enough about identifying and making tradeoffs, so I would be perfectly glad to make the one you describe (and did many times in the past).<br /><br />Unfortunately in this particular case it&#39;s a tradeoff between &quot;paying a price of quality airline while getting random performance&quot; (yeah, you can even pay for business class random performance) versus &quot;actually flying with a quality airline but not out of a Slovenian airport&quot; because for reasons unfathomable to me quality airlines fly from all nearby airports (Trieste, Graz, Vienna, Zagreb, Venice) but not from Ljubljana, so it all transforms into &quot;do I waste time waiting for some random time at the local airport&quot; versus &quot;do I waste somewhat-predictable amount of time driving to some other airport&quot;.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The unfathomable reason(s) might come from the unprofitable direct course Zurich-Ljubljana (vice versa) from the perspective of the airlines. How often is the airplane booked out? The demand from the customers for this direct course might be low.<br />So the solution might be to fly to a nearby airport and take the bus or train from there to get to Ljubljana. With this strategy you might have the best cost-benefit ratio.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I know you&#39;re trying to be helpful, but I&#39;ve been around the block a few times and had to run my own business, so went through all the considerations we&#39;re having several times.<br /><br />Just for fun, here are the facts as I see them:<br /><br />* There are two airlines that would be interested in Zurich-Ljubljana route: Swiss and Adria<br />* Swiss has direct daily flights to Graz which has approximately half the number of passengers Ljubljana has;<br />* Adria has three daily flights to Zurich, and at least before they started messing up everything those flights were pretty full;<br />* Swiss had daily flights to Ljubljana a few years back and they were almost fully booked because pricing was comparable and everyone loved flying Swiss instead of Adria;<br />* Swiss discontinued their flights;<br />* Adria is still flying to Zurich three times a day (sometimes taking the scenic route).<br /><br />Whichever way I look I can&#39;t find a business explanation that would match all these data points.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">My bet is that Star Alliance is trying to help Adria out by giving them monopoly over certain routes, e.g. LJU-ZRH. This is not different to a family giving a struggling family member a hand out. But there must come the time when family says enough is enough and cut off the handouts to those who are either incompetent or taking advantage of family&#39;s good will. There must come the time when even the closest of families throws out those members who don&#39;t contribute to the common objective. Has this time come for Adria?</div>
