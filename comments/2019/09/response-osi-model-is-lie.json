               "html": "Thanks for the extensive comment. While I might agree that a creative reading of ISO/IEC 7498-1 might result in your perspective (and I was always fond of creative reading), there are numerous detailed provisions in the standard that would make most people converge on the standard interpretation. For example:<br /><br />&quot;5.3.2.1. For information to be exchanged between two or more (N+1) entities, an association is established between them in N-layer using N-protocol&quot;<br /><br />This one would directly imply protocol(s) at each layer.<br /><br />Clause 5.6.2.1 and figure 9 when applied recursively results in exactly the stack of headers you drew above, although the wording allows headers or trailers (or anything else).<br /><br />And finally, &quot;5.8.8.1.1 - Control information and user data are transferred between N-entities in N-PDUs. An N-PDU is a unit of data specified in N-protocol and contains N-protocol-control-information and possibly N-user-data&quot; reads as &quot;every N-PDU must have N-header and may have N+1-data&quot; and while we may be creative again and say &quot;but a null layer would have null headers&quot; the generic interpretation of a stack of seven headers (even if some of them are null) would still be correct.<br /><br />There are other places in the text requiring strict communication between layers (N+1-layer entities talk through N-layer entities).<br /><br />I could go on, but I hate retyping text from a scanned paper copy (which is what I got from the ISO web site).<br /><br />So if nothing else, I completely understand how everyone gets their idea even if the preamble to the standard is vaguer than that.",

               "html": "Well, it&#39;s clear that &quot;N-protocol&quot; term exists in the standard, as it is specified as &quot;A set of rules and formats (semantic and syntactic) which determines the communication behavior of (N)-entities in the performance of (N)-functions.&quot;<br /><br />My point is those N-protocols *by definition* rely on N-functions performed by N-entities. If a protocol specifies a set of rules and formats which determine behavior of entities in the performance of functions in several layers, it is by definition not an N-protocol.<br /><br />For example, Ethernet is not L2-protocol in this sense, but 802.3 chapters 6-9 are L1-protocol for 10BASE-5 (Figure 8-1, IEEE Std 802.3-2018, p.216), chapters 2-5 are L2-protocol for any Ethernet network (same as above), and 802.1D is L3-protocol for switched Ethernet. The &quot;Ethernet protocol&quot; in modern sense is just a set of N-protocols in terms of OSI model, where each protocol specifies its own N-functions.<br /><br />&gt; Clause 5.6.2.1 and figure 9 when applied recursively results in exactly the stack of headers you drew above, although the wording allows headers or trailers (or anything else).<br /><br />Figure 9, indeed, illustrate something very similar to what we see in Wireshark, with sequential headers in order that resemble a common &quot;understanding&quot; of N-protocols in OSI. However, even if we assume that the figure show exactly those blocks of bits and how they&#39;re transferred from layer to layer being encapsulated and de-encapsulated, the notes 2 and 3 make all this concept very weak:<br />* Note 2: This figure DOES NOT imply any positional relationship between protocol-control-information and user-data in protocol-data-unit. // there can be header, footer, or control information can be scrambled into data, or whatever<br />* Note 3: An (N)-protocol-data-unit may be mapped one-to-one into an (N - l)-service-data-unit, but OTHER RELATIONSHIPS ARE POSSIBLE. // there can be close to zero relationship between what we see on N+1 layer and &quot;payload&quot; (or SDU) on N-layer.<br /><br />What is even more important, the N-SDU (or N-layer &quot;payload&quot;) is not what we see in Wireshark. If we see a typical sniffed Telnet packet, we only see L1-SDU and not L2-L7 PDUs. The L4 PDU is NOT some extracted substring from it, marked as TCP header, it is by definition an entity existing only withing the L4-entities (loosely saying, TCP handlers on end nodes, even though it&#39;s not about TCP at all).<br /><br />When L4-entity processes its L4-SDU (data), it reads necessary service data from it, adds L4-PCI (some memory structure, which in case of TCP is different from what we know as TCP header at least we need to know a socket, not just a port number), generates L4-PDU, then calls L3-handler and transfers its L4-PDU there, while converting the latter to L3-SDU (providing it with necessary L3 service data).<br /><br />Again, it&#39;s not about Telnet, TCP, BSD sockets, Wireshark or any actual implementation of any existing or fictional protocol. It&#39;s about network functions that can or cannot be implemented in any particular way. OSI model (as well as DoD one) was created not to be a nice representation of onion-like data structures, but to restrict vendors from implementing something that is impossible to reproduce. Those were attempts to regulate vendors and prohibit them to sell solutions that are incompatible not only between different vendors but often even within a single product line. Before that it was possible to implement a remote shell protocol that only worked on a specific OS on a specific mainframe model over a specific cables. Because it would be very dumb to create a standard that whitelists all possible protocols, both models describe not the protocols but network functions, and they restrict relations between those functions.<br /><br />&gt;  I completely understand how everyone gets their idea<br /><br />It&#39;s easy to think that headers order in a *typical* modern packet represents OSI layering, while to read the standard is almost an impossible thing.",

         "html": "There is a huge lie on OSI model. Or misunderstanding. Or a lie. I prefer to think it&#39;s a worldwide lie, and I explain here why.<br /><br />It&#39;s funny that every course, every book teaching us networks begins with that famous model, and it&#39;s always illustrated with the famous ladder-style picture with headers. You know it, something like that:<br /><br />                     Data<br />                  L7|Data<br />               L6|L7|Data<br />            L5|L6|L7|Data<br />         L4|L5|L6|L7|Data<br />      L3|L4|L5|L6|L7|Data<br />   L2|L3|L4|L5|L6|L7|Data<br />L1|L2|L3|L4|L5|L6|L7|Data<br /><br />Sometimes they understand there is no headers on L1 so they omit it. Sometimes they remember Ethernet and PPP-style protocols has trailers so they add FCS. Sometimes they understand that there are always have doubts where in L5-L7 everything is, so they omit them too.<br /><br />This concept explains basics of encapsulation and de-encapsulation on example of OSI model, and obviously this ladder-style thing is senseless in 2019. Protocol encapsulations can be much, incredibly much more complicated than just 7 layers. Moreover, they all agree that Ethernet is L2 protocol and IP is L3 protocol, so if we take, for example, MPLS, it should be... L2.5?<br /><br />Anyway, they all agree that:<br />* There are layers, numbered from 1 to 7, with some crappy names that must be remembered.<br />* Each network protocol corresponds (or means to) to a single layer.<br />* These 7 layers are not enough in 2019, there should be more layers to represent modern protocols<br />* Some of these layers are obsolete and not used in modern world<br />* Notable layers are 2 for Ethernet, 3 for IP, and 4 for TCP<br /><br />----- NOW FUNNY THINGS START -----<br />Only a few people in the world know *what is* that model actually. It&#39;s specified in ISO/IEC 7498, publicly available on ISO website, and almost nobody ever tried to read it.<br /><br />In the list above only one thing is true: it&#39;s actually 7 layers in this model. All the rest claims are false.<br /><br />* The OSI model in ISO/IEC 7498-1 : 1994(E) DOES NOT specify layers for PROTOCOLS.<br /><br />1.18 This Reference Model does not specify services and protocols for OSI. It is neither an implementation specification for systems, nor a basis for appraising the conformance of implementations.<br /><br />* It&#39;s network FUNCTIONS what corresponds to layers in OSI model. Layers are organized in that way that they are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, so 7 is enough for any possible network function. Boundaries between layers help to determine to which layer a single network function belongs to.<br />* PROTOCOLS don&#39;t correspond to layers in OSI model.<br />* Modern (and not so modern) protocols often implement FUNCTIONS that correspond to different layers.<br /><br />For example, modern switched Ethernet implements L1, L2 and L3 functions:<br />- it specifies a communication path in the physical media among two or more physical entities, that&#39;s L1 function per 7.7.2<br />- it specifies data-link connection that is built on top of physical connection, that&#39;s L2 function per 7.6.2.1<br />- it specifies the relaying of data across different physical links, and that&#39;s L3 function per 7.5.2.1<br /><br />And TCP actually does not only L4 tasks like multiplexing data, it actually creates sessions (L5), and selects use of session-services by using TCP options (L6).<br /><br />Please don&#39;t confuse OSI model with OSI protocols stack, that&#39;s a whole another story.<br /><br />I would be happy to hear your objections and additions, accompanied with cites from the standard. Moreover, Ivan, if you would like to tell the truth to the world, I&#39;d gladly assist you with that.",
