         "html": "&gt; The OSI Model does not accurately describe networks.<br /><br />Of course it doesn&#39;t, neither accurately or not. As per 1.18, the Reference Model does not specify services and protocols of OSI, and it is neither an implementation specification for systems, nor a basis for appraising the conformance of implementations.<br /><br />It is - as per 1.4 - a conceptual and functional framework which allows experts to work productively and independently (!) on the development of standards. It does accurately describe network functions/services and their relations, and a single application can implement/use multiple services from multiple different layers.<br /><br />&gt; a framework describing what functionality needs to be present in an end-to-end networking solution<br /><br />Exactly, Clause 7 describes this functionality and groups specific functions to corresponding layers.<br /><br />This toy was made for application developers, not for network engineers. Back in the 80&#39;s almost every network engineer was actually a developer, and the model helped them to develop a healthy ecosystem of protocols, but today it&#39;s rather counterproductive to tell every network kiddie how to build your own network protocol. Windows admins (generally) don&#39;t know what is Von Neumann architecture, why do Cisco guys have to study OSI model?",
