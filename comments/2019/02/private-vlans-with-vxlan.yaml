  html: just adding a small correction to the initial statement - Private VLAN is
    supported with VXLAN on Cisco Nexus <br /> https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/9-x/vxlan/configuration/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_VXLAN_Configuration_Guide_9x/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_VXLAN_Configuration_Guide_9x_chapter_0111.html#d20872e11476a1635
    <br /><br />In addition, EVPN would be able to solve the use-case with what is
    called E-TREE aka RFC8317 (not a 1:1 match) but close as it allows a Layer-2 isolation
    use-case, The presentation by Aldrin is referring more to a hub-and-spoke model
    for IP as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-keyupate-evpn-virtual-hub.
    The port-filter detail is kind of interesting to solve the isolate host use-case
    - very creative :-)

  html: 'Best way to do PVLAN and that sort of group-based filtering will be group
    based policy (GBP).  However the option header has not been finalized so it will
    be some more time before we have an accepted industry standard for it.  See https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-lemon-vxlan-gpe-gbp-02.  There
    is at least one proprietary implementation. '

    html: That&#39;s where you end when you&#39;re trying to solve the problem in
      the wrong place, or if you insist on solving the problem even though the owner
      of the infrastructure where the problem should have been solved hates you. Nothing
      unusual in IT world ;))
