            <div class="comment-content">Hey Ivan,<br /><br />I think we can agree on agreeing :)<br /><br />Subscription versus owning a box: indeed. My initial thoughts on the<br />subject touched upon where you still buy &amp; own the box and switching gear is<br />still mostly a life cycle event. But instead of a perpetual license plus<br />(in theory optional) support contract, you now end up with (e.g. annual)<br />subscriptions. These subscriptions might by default include features you<br />won&#39;t use or need (yet) but end up paying for anyway.<br />That may lead to people going down the rabbit hole to implement more vendor<br />lock-in features, because, well, we&#39;re paying for them anyway.  Of course,<br />if vendor strategy and subscription model happens to match with your<br />business, then it&#39;s a win-win.  For an entrenched player, I kind of doubt<br />that a business model switch is all about pleasing the customer,<br />but for now, let&#39;s chalk that up to it being my cynicism talking :)<br /><br />It&#39;s exactly because of the &#39;cool&#39; features and the CIO tracks I&#39;m using the<br />word agnostic instead of neutral. Architecture and design with clear<br />principles and goals (preferably matching the business needs :), should<br />highlight the options and reasoning behind choosing those options. <br />There&#39;s nothing wrong with using the cool feature set if you there&#39;s an exit<br />strategy or you actually succeed in getting the managers/ CIO to accept the<br />consequences :)<br />Trying to push for vendor _neutral_ is most assuredly an uphill battle. <br /><br />On the subject of software development, innovation and options, it was a<br />flighty thought that made me ponder the various developments compared to<br />what at this moment to me feels like a dearth of serious options in the<br />field of data center &#39;software defined&#39; networking, mainly ACI and NSX, and<br />campus SD-Access.<br />Granted, nothing really new here if you look at the history of (virtual)<br />networking so far.<br />What I didn&#39;t express explicitly but had in mind is what e.g.  happens in<br />the field of &quot;cloudy software design&quot;. Not specifically tied to micro<br />services/service meshes, but it is where a lot is happening with service<br />discovery, smarter load balancing and such. Stuff like consul,<br />envoy/gimbal/contour, istio, traefik, voyager, etc.<br />(not entirely coincidentally of course, proper software design means a clean<br /> network design without gimmickry, but then there&#39;s The Enterprise...)<br /><br />Loads of people use haproxy and nginx but others are working on and are<br />using some serious alternatives. And yes on that note, postgresql is a<br />serious alternative too and I&#39;m always glad when I encounter people using it<br />for their RDBMS :) While a large portions of deployments might use a small<br />subset of the options, it is actually possible to choose innovative options<br />that are actively being worked on and some are here to stay.<br />Maybe &#39;ever expanding&#39; wasn&#39;t exactly the right choice of words, it&#39;s more<br />like new options popping up, some will fade and fizzle out.<br /><br />Aaaanyway, thanks as always for your thoughtful insights.<br /></div>
