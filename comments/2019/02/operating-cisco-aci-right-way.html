            <div class="comment-content">Currently I&#39;m starting to play around with ACI and one of the main challenges is to use the right tool to solve two main topics:<br />1.) Fabric basic configuration (from scratch)<br />2.) Day-by-day operation configuration<br /><br />At the moment my personal conclusion is:<br />- The CLI is good for troubleshooting and show commands. It&#39;s useless for configuration, because not every managed object can be accessed using the CLI (e.g. no AEPs, no reusable access port policies etc.)<br />- The GUI offers a complete way to configure the fabric. I didn&#39;t discover a single task, which is not configurable via the GUI. Drawback, especially with use case (1) is, that your mouse hand will be two or three times stronger compared to the other hand after you are done with the configuration. Furthermore, the chance to do configuration errors is pretty high.<br />Nevertheless the GUI is pretty good to get a JSON or XML blueprint of configuration.<br /><br />I checked out cobra and thought it would be a good idea to privision the whole fabric using &quot;simple&quot; python scripts.... a python one liner is more readable compared to the correspoding 10 liner JSON template :) However, it was no so simple at the end of the day.<br /><br />Long story short:<br />At the moment I&#39;m using ansible using the aci_rest module to provision the fabric. I&#39;m not at the point of day-by-day operational tasks, but for the fabric bootstrapping it&#39;s pretty good.<br />I&#39;m using jinja2 templates with the JSON payload to set up the fabric. All variable configuration parameters are in readable yaml files.<br />Until now I&#39;m pretty happy with it :)</div>
