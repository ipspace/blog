      "html": "just adding a small correction to the initial statement - Private VLAN is supported with VXLAN on Cisco Nexus <br /> https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/9-x/vxlan/configuration/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_VXLAN_Configuration_Guide_9x/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_VXLAN_Configuration_Guide_9x_chapter_0111.html#d20872e11476a1635 <br /><br />In addition, EVPN would be able to solve the use-case with what is called E-TREE aka RFC8317 (not a 1:1 match) but close as it allows a Layer-2 isolation use-case, The presentation by Aldrin is referring more to a hub-and-spoke model for IP as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-keyupate-evpn-virtual-hub. The port-filter detail is kind of interesting to solve the isolate host use-case - very creative :-)",

However the option header has not been finalized so it will be some more time before we have an accepted industry standard for it.  See https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-lemon-vxlan-gpe-gbp-02.  There is at least one proprietary implementation. ",
