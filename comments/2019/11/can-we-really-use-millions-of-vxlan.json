      "html": "Dear Joe, Ivan Pepelnjak, VxVLAN are good to expand from the 12 bit IEEE 1-4094 Vlan space to a greater space. VxVlans using MP iBGP and appropriate new VPLS adrresss family are the best tool to perform multiple DCI interconnects going beyond the use of VPLS even VPLS with iBGP autodiscovery and LDP (cisco variant I have used in University of Padova). I tried also to make co-exist VPLS with LDP and BGP autodiscovery with VPLS with MP BGP and MP BGP autodiscovery (Juniper version seen in Alicante in 2011.   I am happy that Nicola Modena is working with you at IPSpace.<br /><br />Best Regards<br />Giuseppe Larosa CCIE SP # 14802",
