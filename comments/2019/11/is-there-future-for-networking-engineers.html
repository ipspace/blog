            <div class="comment-content">In these days Network engineers need to develop some programming skills, by that with the collaboration with core programming guys develop SDN/IBN App which can help the develop zero touch Orchestration. No issue with the job only need to develop some programming skills.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I think the ATM story came from a book, or at least I first heard it on this podcast about a book a few years ago (I haven&#39;t read the book): https://www.econtalk.org/james-bessen-on-learning-by-doing/ <br /><br />From a statistical perspective this can of course happen, but the questions every bank teller or engineer is asking themselves are not really statistical - they are personal and individual, and there the effect is not necessarily the same - the demand might be still there, but you might not be able to move town to continue being a teller for example, or not have the time to learn new skills, etc. <br /><br />The network engineering situation is a little better since the learning element has always been an essential part of the job, so that makes that a little easier. <br /><br />Also, because I totally agree with your rant about broken application deployment: a beneficial side effect of this has been that it made network engineers involved with, willingly or not - and therefore more or less competent in - a lot more than just networking, which makes it possible for them to deliver some or more value across a technology &quot;spectrum&quot; if they care for it, as opposed to being just &quot;vlan and firewall rule manipulators&quot;. I will guess this might be more so in internal IT departments where different technology groups are sort of in the same boat than in outsourced engineering service vendors, for example, where these tech silos can be a little harder to break. But of course this all depends on the structure and mindset of the operation. Then there are the tech companies that were able to turn engineering services into products, which is where the cross-competency development probably happens more naturally, and which I don&#39;t know why so many businesses think they can easily turn into, too (and by tomorrow). <br /><br />I guess networks and the fundamentals of networking did not really change too much, they just got abstracted away and/or recombined if you will - that does not make them irrelevant, they actually help in understanding innovation. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">Agreed! and I hope we end up with something that is a healthy mix of external (vendor) and internal solutions. I want to see more internal development in enterprises as well, whether that be automation, open-source, or even self-designed network topology. <br /><br />I don&#39;t think we can get away with just cramming our square business problems into a circle vendor solution anymore. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">Abstractions require someone who understands the thing they&#39;re abstracting. Network engineers won&#39;t go away, they&#39;ll just become more invisible. People who will believe they&#39;ve disappeared will just keep perpetuating the myth that network engineers are extinct.</div>
