Thank you for that! <br /><br />Not sure if the right place (comment in blog), considering the limited (to subscribers) access to the material, but I&#39;d be interested in the followings:<br />- Cisco Cloud ACI on AWS - is the Cloud APIC integration into Infra VPC same if using Outposts? Or is there another method?<br />- Care to elaborate on the &quot;taboo&quot; and &quot;future&quot; labels, also in the Cisco ACI - AWS areas of your material? ",
