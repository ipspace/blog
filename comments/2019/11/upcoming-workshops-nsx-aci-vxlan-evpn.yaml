    html: 'In principle (but I&#39;d have to check the details), Outposts external
      connectivity is similar to AWS region external connectivity, and in case of
      ACI-on-AWS they rely just on having IP connectivity between ACI spine switches
      and CSR1K in Infra VPC... so I wouldn&#39;t expect anything to change.<br /><br

      /><br />Future: coming in a future ACI release (according to their documentation).'

  html: 'Great update. Thank you for that! <br /><br />Not sure if the right place
    (comment in blog), considering the limited (to subscribers) access to the material,
    but I&#39;d be interested in the followings:<br />- Cisco Cloud ACI on AWS - is
    the Cloud APIC integration into Infra VPC same if using Outposts? Or is there
    another method?<br />- Care to elaborate on the &quot;taboo&quot; and &quot;future&quot;
    labels, also in the Cisco ACI - AWS areas of your material? '
