  html: In these days Network engineers need to develop some programming skills, by
    that with the collaboration with core programming guys develop SDN/IBN App which
    can help the develop zero touch Orchestration. No issue with the job only need
    to develop some programming skills.

  html: 'I think the ATM story came from a book, or at least I first heard it on this
    podcast about a book a few years ago (I haven&#39;t read the book): https://www.econtalk.org/james-bessen-on-learning-by-doing/
    <br /><br />From a statistical perspective this can of course happen, but the
    questions every bank teller or engineer is asking themselves are not really statistical
    - they are personal and individual, and there the effect is not necessarily the
    same - the demand might be still there, but you might not be able to move town
    to continue being a teller for example, or not have the time to learn new skills,
    etc. <br /><br />The network engineering situation is a little better since the
    learning element has always been an essential part of the job, so that makes that
    a little easier. <br /><br />Also, because I totally agree with your rant about
    broken application deployment: a beneficial side effect of this has been that
    it made network engineers involved with, willingly or not - and therefore more
    or less competent in - a lot more than just networking, which makes it possible
    for them to deliver some or more value across a technology &quot;spectrum&quot;
    if they care for it, as opposed to being just &quot;vlan and firewall rule manipulators&quot;.
    I will guess this might be more so in internal IT departments where different
    technology groups are sort of in the same boat than in outsourced engineering
    service vendors, for example, where these tech silos can be a little harder to
    break. But of course this all depends on the structure and mindset of the operation.
    Then there are the tech companies that were able to turn engineering services
    into products, which is where the cross-competency development probably happens
    more naturally, and which I don&#39;t know why so many businesses think they can
    easily turn into, too (and by tomorrow). <br /><br />I guess networks and the
    fundamentals of networking did not really change too much, they just got abstracted
    away and/or recombined if you will - that does not make them irrelevant, they
    actually help in understanding innovation. '

  html: 'Agreed! and I hope we end up with something that is a healthy mix of external
    (vendor) and internal solutions. I want to see more internal development in enterprises
    as well, whether that be automation, open-source, or even self-designed network
    topology. <br /><br />I don&#39;t think we can get away with just cramming our
    square business problems into a circle vendor solution anymore. '

  html: Abstractions require someone who understands the thing they&#39;re abstracting.
    Network engineers won&#39;t go away, they&#39;ll just become more invisible. People
    who will believe they&#39;ve disappeared will just keep perpetuating the myth
    that network engineers are extinct.
