    html: Why would you need to synchronize the connection tables? Does it matter?
      How often do you get WAN link failures and traffic failover to the other side?
      What applications can&#39;t recover from session loss?

    html: I agree, failure scenario does not happen often, but I&#39;ve seen several
      applications (not web based) that have problem to recover from a connection
      failure. More often is the customer that not accept the idea to do not have
      the synchronization of connections table...until they face with scenario of
      split brain of course :)

  html: Hi Ivan, I&#39;ve always looked at design with indipendent firewall nodes
    connected via routing, but how synchronize the connections table? Is the firewall
    sandwich design (firewall between load balancers) an alternative solution?

    html: '&quot;How long have you been saying now that this is a bad idea?&quot;
      &lt;&lt; too long. And yes, I feel like that famous gentleman who had issues
      with windmills.<br /><br />I also understand your perspective (and potential
      frustrations), but that doesn&#39;t make it right.'

  html: How long have you been saying now that this is a bad idea?<br /><br />I work
    for a firewall vendor. RFP requirements have to be met for us to sell product.
    RFP&#39;s always have it as a requirement (even if the customer isn&#39;t going
    to use it). If it&#39;s not an RFP the customer still tells we have to support
    it if we want to sell firewalls to them. If the vendor engineers (like me) try
    to tell them it&#39;s a bad idea, they just think it&#39;s because we are trying
    to sell them more stuff. But the firewalls are a small part of the whole design
    anyway, so why would they change it based on my advice?

  html: 'Funny thing you would mention this today Ivan, i had to replace an undisclosed
    firewall vendors subsidiary node last week when the node went active for no apparent
    reason. the short story : &quot;the unit was replaced&quot; the sync process scares
    me a little more now. btw, i blame the tree for getting in the way.'

  html: Thanks for this (and other too) article - balanced, realistic and well reasoned.
    My impression is that nowadays we often forget about fundamentals. Or not even
    forget, but not finding enough courage and energy to check the claims made by
    others (vendors?).
