      "html": "How long have you been saying now that this is a bad idea?<br /><br />I work for a firewall vendor. RFP requirements have to be met for us to sell product. RFP&#39;s always have it as a requirement (even if the customer isn&#39;t going to use it). If it&#39;s not an RFP the customer still tells we have to support it if we want to sell firewalls to them. If the vendor engineers (like me) try to tell them it&#39;s a bad idea, they just think it&#39;s because we are trying to sell them more stuff. But the firewalls are a small part of the whole design anyway, so why would they change it based on my advice?",
