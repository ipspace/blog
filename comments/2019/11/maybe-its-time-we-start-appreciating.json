Same as vendor &quot;lock-in&quot;) - broader context is important.<br /><br />I think it&#39;s crucial to see business perspective, expected lifetime of the solution, sometimes it&#39;s easier to build &quot;new parallel network&quot;, cost of support, etc.<br />",

         "html": "Good article. As an anecdote: John Moy used to tell you to take your slides of the projector (yeah, the beamers of old ;-) if you couldn&#39;t confirm that you have already written code &amp; ran it for what you&#39;re presenting. Point was not that &quot;code is the standard&quot;, point was that the quality of what you present will be pobably too sketchy and full of holes if an initial implementation did not force you to think through all the involved issues. My personal take on what&#39;s going is that ISO put process before substance and was too water-logged to move @ speed, IETF went the opposite direction and that was a big advantage when things we did were small and not that important as in &quot;heh, video over internet, why?, heh, 911 on IP, who&#39;s crazy?&quot;. Now that IP grew up massively the sins of the fathers need to be paid, some of them can be fixed (two implementations interop&#39;ed in routing group please before standards track) and some cannot really as in &quot;let&#39;s patch back a security architecture into IP&quot;. My usual mildly acerbic 2c ;-)",

         "html": "We can afford for some non-standard solutions thanks to existing standards. For example, we can use different SD-WAN solutions thanks to standard routing protocols which can tie them together or place to the Internet edge. Avoiding standards is a bad approach but also waiting for a standard can slow down a new innovation too much. So we need both, in my opinion. No-standards as predecessors of standards.",
