  html: I would replace &#39;American&#39; with &#39;Marketing-Engineers&#39; and
    &#39;Eastern-Europeans&#39; with &#39;Experienced-Engineers&#39;;)<br /><br />I
    am also from &#39;EE&#39; region and when I come across new technology I start
    googling for &#39;x drawbacks&#39;:) Not because I am pessimist or negative but
    because I&#39;ll responsible for supporting/maintaining x stuff.<br /><br />Ivan,
    keep at it!

  html: You could also replace the word &quot;negative&quot; with &quot;pragmatic&quot;.
    Honestly, reading about new technologies on your blog often can be a bummer, but,
    I, like all your other fans, rely on your pragmatic approach to describing new
    technologies, and continue to be avid supporter of your efforts year after year.
    I&#39;d second Bogdan above and also say, Ivan, keep at it! Me and my job is very
    much reliant on you! :)
