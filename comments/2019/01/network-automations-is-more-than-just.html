            <div class="comment-content">For many network engineers, unless you learn during personal time, you will not be able to learn the full scope of what DevOps or Automation really means. I have gone through this transition myself. I have worked at large enterprise companies for many years, and It was not until I quit and joined a startup that was fully focused on DevOps that I really started to understand the culture and what it meant. Now, I am back at a large enterprise company and it is the same issues all over again. I try to change the culture, I&#39;ve held training on Python, Git, Ansible, Jenkins, etc. However, nobody on my team seems to fully grasp it. And I do not blame them, it is very hard to speak a new language when you take night classes to learn it; also, you will never be fully fluent in another language unless you speak it every day with others who are already fluent, even more, you need to immerse yourself in the culture to fully understand it. For traditional network engineers, who don&#39;t want to spend nights and weekends learning and who don&#39;t work in a DevOps culture, I would say to just focus on Ansible until you are an expert, then move to the next thing. This can be done one tool at a time over a few years, no need to rush. Start with Ansible because the learning curve is mild and it can have a large impact. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">Seconding Matt&#39;s comment, I would suggest learning Ansible on its own as a starting point, then moving on to Git, Python, Vagrant at later more advanced stages. The blog makes a good point about learning all the tools together, but, like Matt, it simply has not been practical for me at a large enterprise. With just Ansible alone to start, I could however see picking some low hanging fruits to start on the automation process and then move on to more complete automation projects using more advanced tools.</div>
