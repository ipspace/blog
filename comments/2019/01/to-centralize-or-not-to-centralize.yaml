  html: 'Very good point Ivan! We run centralized DC solution similar to VCF and every
    software upgrade we think about how awesome it would have been to have separate
    control plane. Even vendor TAC after stumbling upon those Byzantine failures just
    basically recommends rebooting whole DC at once during software rollouts. <br
    />Speaking about hidden complexities - article of &quot;Leaky Abstractions&quot;
    posted earlier is a great read. Thanks! '

  html: +1 for distributed control plane and explicit complexity. Dealing with implicit
    complexity is desirable sometimes but imo at the end of the day implicit complexity
    is equivalent to unknown complexity resulting in design and operations headaches
    down the road. The best example is probably any MLAG implementation. Looks good
    on paper, but has a lot of caveats that cause a lot more complexity with little
    benefit. There is a reason Cisco&#39;s vPC design guide is 129 pages long. Magic
    has its price.

  html: I know the question is asked within the context of data center, but what about
    sd-wan then? with centralized controller and its magic happening under the hood?
