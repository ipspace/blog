In this case no visibility.  <br />Old token-ring had visibility on management frames that you could troubleshoot using any only promiscuous DOS based frame capture program.  Took me a few minutes to find a problem and not two days.<br />The two days implies they had no decent tiger teams.  I suggest the following for them: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/six-tiger-team-structures-used-operations-centers-deal-ronald-bartels/",

CL is an amalgam of CL, L3 and Time Warner Cable, plus more that I don&#39;t have the time to research. Perhpaps a large L2 domain is not as big a problem if you have the right visibility and processes in place. But since introducing humans into a highly complex system is bound to end up with a  human making a honest error, then its best to engineer the human out of the equation and/or learn the lessons of the hyper-scalers limiting the failure domain.",
