  html: Buggy as hell and more nerd knobs than a NASA space shuttle, I see the benefits
    of the technology but not necessarily in detriment to the stability of our WAN,
    hopefully 2019 will be a more stable year once the last few wrinkles are ironed
    out - finger&#39;s X&#39;d!

  html: With SD-WAN, you&#39;re really buying into a black box that controls how apps
    are identified, how traffic is forwarded, how asymmetry is handled, how link degradation
    is detected, how direct-internet-access is utilized, and how public cloud is connected.
    That&#39;s a lot of vendor-proprietary &quot;secret sauce!&quot; It&#39;s very
    tough to compare vendors and predict if their approach is going to serve all your
    needs now and in the future (or if instead you end up covered in secret sauce).<br
    /><br />Most SD-WAN products are fine to replace simple singly-attached hub-and-spoke
    WANs, as well as retail where apps are relatively static. But if you have multiple
    WAN/Internet circuits, multiple WAN destinations, or an app landscape that changes
    with the wind, then you really need to evaluate carefully.<br /><br />And, by
    all means, please engineer your WAN edge to make it easy to add, remove, and change
    SD-WAN products, including the ability to run two different products side-by-side.<br

  html: By now I have done Pre-Sales, Architecture &amp; Implementation of SD-WAN
    for couple of clients.<br /><br />There are few observations I have based on my
    own experiences at field.<br /><br />1. SD-WAN may or maynot work as expected
    on Day 1 and you may need to finetune lot of knobs to get things done the way
    you want.<br />2. Most Enterprises traditionally were using MPLS Layer 3 VPNs.
    Which in most cases means they don&#39;t usually have in house expertise into
    Routing &amp; Overlays. Which is often ignored by both Consultants and Clients
    as Client might not have enough operational experience with Complex Routing.<br
    />3. SD-WAN is no Silver Bullet. Proper Design, Architecture &amp; Methodology
    are still very important.<br />4. Most SD-WAN vendors over commit when it comes
    to solutions capabilities and don&#39;t have very good documentation publically
    available.<br />5. Most SD-WAN solutions uses some sort of Secret sauce. So essentially
    it&#39;s a Black Box.<br />6. To sell SD-WAN as a service , Telco&#39;s typically
    need different set of features which most SD-WAN solutions are not designed around
    or rather have partial capabilities. <br /><br />7. One observation I have personally
    for different so called SDN products is that most don&#39;t get the Abstractions
    right when it comes to Management portal/platform while trying to introduce programmability
    approach. While I agree most should support programmability &amp; automation through
    APIs and that&#39;s what most vendors are trying to do, From abstraction standpoint
    that doesn&#39;t mean one should go through 7 different screens to configure a
    VLAn and map it back to physical interface on switch. I don&#39;t understand why
    vendors don&#39;t understand that these are two separate problems to be solved
    to begin with.<br /><br />HTH...<br />Evil CCIE

  html: The biggest disadvantage for me as a network guy is the lack of transparency
    in how things work and absence of the generally accepted reference. <br />It is
    all black box magic - you don&#39;t know why it works and you don&#39;t know why
    it does not. <br />If I add more complex apps over it - will it continue working
    ? <br />For the simple wan redundancy and simplistic load sharing things work
    for the most vendors. But if something breaks you are left to the vendor tac professionalism
    mercy. There is no RFC I can read and try to compare/reference. <br />Reminds
    me of wan accelerators history (Cisco WAAS) - if it works it works, but if it
    breaks have TAC phone ready.

  html: Is anyone who has commented able to elaborate a little on the vendor(s) solution
    you have deployed/worked with?
