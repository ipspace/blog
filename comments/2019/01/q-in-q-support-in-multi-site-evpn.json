All you need is to configure separate EVPN instance for every tenant, and inside that instance provide CVLANS for that customer.<br /><br />And if you still think you need QnQ in EVPN - look at Juniper: https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/topic-map/evpn-vxlan-flexible-vlan-tag.html<br />But expect a LOT of limitations, especially on the QFX5100 hardware.",
