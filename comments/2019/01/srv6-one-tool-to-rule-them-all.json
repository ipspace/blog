      "html": "It&#39;s not because we always did somthing one way we should not improve what we do. Without this spirit, we will not have walk to the moon, we will not have the Internet.<br /><br />40 years ago when we started with IP, we didn&#39;t tougth we will have the success we do have today. IPv4 header was define without taking in account all modern services such as L3VPN, L2VPN, Traffic Engineering, Security, Network Programming... To address theses services we had to insert all kind of encapsulations (MPLS, VxLAN, NSH, IPSec,...) between the Link Layer (L2) and the Network Layer (L3). <br /><br />The IPv6 Flow Header, the IPv6 Security Header and the IPv6 Segment-Routing Header gives the industry the opportunity to integrate theses functions in the IPv6 header, gives the opportunity to do better route summarization, gives us the opportunity to start theses services from compute platform in secure way.<br /> <br />Why should we address IPv6 like we always did for IPv4 ???
