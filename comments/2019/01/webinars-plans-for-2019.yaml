    html: 'I would strongly recommend reading https://www.amazon.com/Hello-World-Being-Human-Algorithms/dp/039363499X
      - it explains the concepts and drawbacks of all these overhyped technologies
      in layman terms.<br /><br />Next step: realize that other industries are throwing
      orders of magnitude more money at the problem, and still face those same challenges.<br
      /><br />Finally, most of the AI/ML stuff is either decision trees in disguise
      or applied statistics.'

    html: Yes, I am familiar with ARM MCU &amp; sensor industry - they managed to
      distinguish &quot;walk&quot; from &quot;run&quot; using NN framework + wearable
      sensors;)

    They Died&quot;;)

    html: '#1 and #2 - we&#39;re working on a cloud-focused online course.<br /><br
      />#3 - still no online documentation. You know I&#39;m not touching anything
      that doesn&#39;t meet this simple criteria ;)<br /><br />#4 - That would definitely
      fit within networking fundamentals.<br /><br />#5 - Sure, if I manage to find
      someone who&#39;d be willing to do it. For me LISP is still a solution in search
      of a problem ;)<br /><br />Thanks a million<br />Ivan'

  html: Thanks Ivan,<br /><br />Another few which came later into my mind :<br /><br
    />- IoT Protocols &amp; Networking<br />- Telco Networks for IP Engineers ( 4G,
    LTE, 5G, WAG, SAMOG...Probably only SP Engineers will be interested but for sure
    interest should be there)<br />- TCP/IP Deep Dive followed by Wireshark<br />-
    REST Deep Dive<br />- Linux basics &amp; Networking for IP Engineers<br />- ODL
    ... May be<br />
