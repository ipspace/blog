  html: Completely agree with this blog from the engineer&#39;s perspective but unfortunately
    the the pointy-haired-bosses that are ultimately responsible and accountable from
    a business standpoint don&#39;t always understand the struggles of these these

    roadblocks felt by the larger team.
