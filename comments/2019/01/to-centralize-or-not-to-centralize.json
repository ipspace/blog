      "html": "Very good point Ivan! We run centralized DC solution similar to VCF and every software upgrade we think about how awesome it would have been to have separate control plane. Even vendor TAC after stumbling upon those Byzantine failures just basically recommends rebooting whole DC at once during software rollouts. <br />Speaking about hidden complexities - article of &quot;Leaky Abstractions&quot; posted earlier is a great read. Thanks! ",

      "html": "+1 for distributed control plane and explicit complexity. Dealing with implicit complexity is desirable sometimes but imo at the end of the day implicit complexity is equivalent to unknown complexity resulting in design and operations headaches down the road. The best example is probably any MLAG implementation. Looks good on paper, but has a lot of caveats that cause a lot more complexity with little benefit. There is a reason Cisco&#39;s vPC design guide is 129 pages long. Magic has its price.",
