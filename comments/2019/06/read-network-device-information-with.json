      "html": "Some of the monitoring data we used to get via SNMP is becoming RESTful API data - for example, the CPU or disk space of an ACI controller. Monitoring tools will need to integrate RESTful sources...though I&#39;m having a hard time finding one that does, because most RESTful API monitoring tools are built for API developers to monitor the availability of the API itself.",

      "html": "Another approach I&#39;ve used is to store Cisco ACI API data ( i.e. Ansible URI call for faults extract ) in the .html file format ( filtered appropriately ) and send a batch of them at specific time of day to my email with Cron job. Then I just set a rule on my email to easily find it. Because it&#39;s an .html I can just double click on it and it pops up the content in web browser.",
