  html: "I\u2019ve had some stick time with a couple SD-WAN solutions as well and\
    \ generally agree with the comment you quoted. I\u2019m still debating whether\
    \ the software is more buggy than normal (completely possible since it\u2019s\
    \ a fairly unique way of doing things) or if the bugs hurt so much more since\
    \ everything is abstracted and the operator doesn\u2019t have the tools to effectively\
    \ troubleshoot these issues. <br /><br />When a bug appears on a traditional switch/router,\
    \ an experienced operator tends to be able narrow down the problem and have a\
    \ specific conversation with the vendor about what needs to be done. The problems\
    \ that I\u2019m running across in SD-WAN solutions are typically show stoppers\
    \ and there is little I can do to remediate, troubleshoot, or diagnose. <br /><br\
    \ />It makes the whole experience a bit frustrating. I\u2019m still convinced\
    \ that SD-WAN can provide significant value in today\u2019s enterprise/SP market\
    \ but we still have some maturing to do before we can expect the hype to even\
    \ come close to reality. "

    html: There are supposedly very-large-scale data centers that could benefit from
      segment routing in the core (more so if you&#39;re the only $vendor with this
      particular hammer). However, as I did interviews with routing gurus a while
      ago nobody could give me a persuasive use case. Please note that the WAN edge
      is a different story.<br /><br />So it seems like you were dealing with either
      a $vendor evangelist who drank too much Kool-Aid or someone blinded by the glitz
      of the new technology to the extent that he couldn&#39;t figure out whether
      it makes sense to deploy it (along the lines of &quot;LISP is the answer...
      what exactly was the question?&quot; discussion I had a long while ago)

  html: 'Ivan, great post, it&#39;s time to say stop to all these marketing stupidities.
    <br />I think you should write a similar one on Segment Routing: &quot;Real-Life
    Segment Routing Experience&quot;. How many ISPs are using it? Which business case
    they want to solve deploying SR? Which controller they use use to define paths?
    and so forth. <br />Lately, in a consulting service I have heard the most stupid
    thing in my humble life of networker: a well known $vendor wanted to sell an IXP
    which has currently a classical DC L2 and want to switch to VXLAN+EVPN, their
    products telling us they support Segment Routing, which is very important for
    a DC. Did you hear well? Segment Routing in a DC Leaf-and-Spine, where all paths
    are two hops. It reminded me of &quot;Thast&#39;s incredible&quot;, an old entertainment
    show of USA TV...  '

  html: 'I was also lucky enough to pilot two of the leading SD-WAN vendors, one of
    which actually made it out of the lab and into a remote site. It was fine and
    even better than what we have in some respects but the remote stack turns out
    to still include our current security appliances because the SD-WAN products can&#39;t
    really do everything in a single edge product. The vendor&#39;s solution to our
    limited space and power at the remotes is to move the delicate SD-WAN edge product
    onto a universal CPE running the edge and our existing security appliance as service-chained
    virtual instances in an openstack jenga tower. Aside from this not working at
    all in our labs yet, how in the world is this easier to deploy and manage than
    what we already have? I&#39;m cautiously optimistic but if I were a betting man,
    I&#39;d put my money on just upgrading our aging security appliances. '

  html: Well most problems in this world can be only solved once we admit there are
    problems. As soon you admit, you can pretty much find a set of possible solutions.<br
    /><br />Most SD-WAN vendors documentation is not good enough, Having some sort
    of secret sauce added into it makes it a Black Box solution anyways. Their own
    SMEs have limited understanding about how things work behind the scenes. To my
    personal understanding 90%+ deployments of SD-WAN in industry are still manual
    which itself defeat the purpose of rosy SDx concepts.<br /><br />And of course
    everyone want to take this madness to next level with IBN idea.<br /><br />HTH...<br
