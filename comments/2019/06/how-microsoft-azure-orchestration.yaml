    html: I used their CLI (az) run from cloud shell, so supposedly sitting close

  html: 'Now we know why REST API calls are stateless. With this implementation quality
    in mind, I can&#39;t take Azure serious any more. What tool or software did you
    use to call the API?<br />PS: Assuming 10 bits for a character (asynchronous)

    up with ghost resources: they appear in the bills but you can&#39;t find them
    anywhere. Get the detailed usage report via CLI &quot;az consumption usage list&quot;
    and make sure you provide a date range, otherwise the CLI may hang.'
