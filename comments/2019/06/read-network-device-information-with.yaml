  html: Some of the monitoring data we used to get via SNMP is becoming RESTful API
    data - for example, the CPU or disk space of an ACI controller. Monitoring tools
    will need to integrate RESTful sources...though I&#39;m having a hard time finding
    one that does, because most RESTful API monitoring tools are built for API developers
    to monitor the availability of the API itself.

  html: Another approach I&#39;ve used is to store Cisco ACI API data ( i.e. Ansible
    URI call for faults extract ) in the .html file format ( filtered appropriately
    ) and send a batch of them at specific time of day to my email with Cron job.
    Then I just set a rule on my email to easily find it. Because it&#39;s an .html
    I can just double click on it and it pops up the content in web browser.
