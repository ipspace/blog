      "html": "The holes I mentioned relate to &quot;parts of the configurations you&#39;re not sure about&quot;. <br /><br />Say that you&#39;re running your network with configuration A and you need to change its behavior for some reason. Perhaps you want to increase the amount of load balancing or prevent some transit traffic. For the first requirement, you know that you&#39;ve to modify the link weights somehow (to get ECMP) and, for the second one, you know that you&#39;ve to adapt your route-maps (to tag/drop routes accordingly). What you do with NetComplete is &quot;highlight&quot;/&quot;create a hole&quot; for the weights/route-map in your existing configuration A and then ask it to &quot;fill them in&quot; so that the resulting configuration meets the requirements: i.e. it load balances and prevents transit traffic.<br /><br />I agree with you that &quot;holes&quot; is a perhaps a badly chosen term here: &quot;parts to change&quot; is perhaps a better way to understand it?<br /><br />Hope it clarifies, if not, please shoot again!!<br /><br />Laurent",
