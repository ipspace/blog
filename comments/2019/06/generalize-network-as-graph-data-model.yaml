    html: '&quot;If we have for example 4 routers connected via (broadcast) multiple
      access network, one would have 4 node,iflist dictionaries&quot; &lt;&lt; Correct<br
      /><br />&quot;Or do you elect a pseudonode in such a case and change the data
      model?&quot; &lt;&lt; Absolutely not, OSPF needs pseudonode because in a regular
      graph cannot have more than two nodes attached to an edge.<br /><br />&quot;Also
      your iflist is really an ifdict, isn&#39;t it?&quot; &lt;&lt; fair point ;)'

  html: 'Do I understand your OSPF type 2 LSA analogy correctly: If we have for example
    4 routers connected via (broadcast) multiple access network, one would have 4
    node,iflist dictionaries in a list element of the links dictionary? Or do you
    elect a pseudonode in such a case and change the data model?<br />Also your iflist
    is really an ifdict, isn&#39;t it?'
