      "html": "Is it possible that your &quot;setup.sh&quot; script doesn&#39;t work? Because there isn&#39;t a &quot;ansible.cfg&quot; file in &quot;Data-Models&quot; folder.<br />Too bad that you used &quot;if node != &#39;prefix&#39;&quot; in the templates. It looks cumbersome to me. I don&#39;t understand why you didn&#39;t use the nodes dictionary.<br />Your &quot;Network_Prefix/network.yml&quot; data model reminds me of OSPFv3 with LSA type 1,2,8,9. But I don&#39;t think it was your intent to reinvent OSPFv3 LSA types, wasn&#39;t it?",
