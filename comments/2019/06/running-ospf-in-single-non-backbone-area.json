Sure it works but why would you do that to yourself and worse still the next person along who has to learn your environment and maintain it...",

          "html": "There could be several reasons for doing such a design, maybe the customer could be having connections to multiple business partners or maybe they want some routes from RIPv1 domain or it could be even for some political reason ;) I agree that it may not be a a best practice, but the point here is, it worked and met the customer requirement. Whether they keep it temporary or as a fixed design depends on the maturity of the organization.<br />",

      "html": "Your subscriber mentioned &quot;customer VRF&quot; so maybe MP-BGP MPLS VPN is used. The network topology works even with area 0 and non-zero areas at different sites (MPLS backbone is a super backbone/super area 0). OSPF routes within an area which are redistributed to BGP should be treated as type 3 summary LSA. A potential problem one could face is when you redistribute within the NSSA area: those OSPF routes are treated as type 7 NSSA external LSAs (converted to type 5 LSA by the ABR) and will be redistributed back to OSPF as type 5 LSAs at a different site. They would be blocked there if it&#39;s a NSSA. With NSSA you may need to configure an explicit default route.<br />I&#39;m wondering what business problem your subscriber wants to solve with a NSSA. I&#39;m also wondering why the customer uses OSPF for interconneting sites to begin with. But I&#39;m wondering the most who&#39;s the service provider which is supporting OSPF for peering.<br />Maybe Ivan could quickly verify my statements with his highly automated CI/CD pipeline in his virutal lab ;)",
