    html: Yeah, I could use another layer of dictionaries (and it would definitely
      be a cleaner data model), but that seemed cumbersome to work with (from the
      operator perspective) at the time.<br /><br />As for OSPFv3 data types - there&#39;s
      only so many ways to solve a given problem in a semi-sane way, so most of the
      solutions will have at least a partial overlap ;)

  html: Is it possible that your &quot;setup.sh&quot; script doesn&#39;t work? Because
    there isn&#39;t a &quot;ansible.cfg&quot; file in &quot;Data-Models&quot; folder.<br
    />Too bad that you used &quot;if node != &#39;prefix&#39;&quot; in the templates.
    It looks cumbersome to me. I don&#39;t understand why you didn&#39;t use the nodes
    dictionary.<br />Your &quot;Network_Prefix/network.yml&quot; data model reminds
    me of OSPFv3 with LSA type 1,2,8,9. But I don&#39;t think it was your intent to
    reinvent OSPFv3 LSA types, wasn&#39;t it?

  html: The underlying problem with your &quot;setup.sh&quot; script lies in your
    &quot;.gitignore&quot; file.

  html: 'next step is to move that data into IPAM, so that each /31 is based on IPAM
    request :) '
