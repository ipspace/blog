  html: Maybe this is the missing reference from the old times you mention here? It
    also still has the PDF there. <br />https://learning.nil.com/tips-and-tricks/technical-articles/show/when-ospf-becomes-a-distance-vector-protocol/<br

  html: Interesting thanks. Another classic &quot;It works but why would you do that?&quot;
    The worst example of that I&#39;ve ever seen in my career was a NATed BGP session.
    Sure it works but why would you do that to yourself and worse still the next person
    along who has to learn your environment and maintain it...

    html: There could be several reasons for doing such a design, maybe the customer
      could be having connections to multiple business partners or maybe they want
      some routes from RIPv1 domain or it could be even for some political reason
      ;) I agree that it may not be a a best practice, but the point here is, it worked
      and met the customer requirement. Whether they keep it temporary or as a fixed
      design depends on the maturity of the organization.<br />

  html: 'Your subscriber mentioned &quot;customer VRF&quot; so maybe MP-BGP MPLS VPN
    is used. The network topology works even with area 0 and non-zero areas at different
    sites (MPLS backbone is a super backbone/super area 0). OSPF routes within an
    area which are redistributed to BGP should be treated as type 3 summary LSA. A
    potential problem one could face is when you redistribute within the NSSA area:
    those OSPF routes are treated as type 7 NSSA external LSAs (converted to type
    5 LSA by the ABR) and will be redistributed back to OSPF as type 5 LSAs at a different
    site. They would be blocked there if it&#39;s a NSSA. With NSSA you may need to
    configure an explicit default route.<br />I&#39;m wondering what business problem
    your subscriber wants to solve with a NSSA. I&#39;m also wondering why the customer
    uses OSPF for interconneting sites to begin with. But I&#39;m wondering the most
    who&#39;s the service provider which is supporting OSPF for peering.<br />Maybe
    Ivan could quickly verify my statements with his highly automated CI/CD pipeline
    in his virutal lab ;)'
