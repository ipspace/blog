            <div class="comment-content">It sounds to me that the SD-WAN craze has gone through a number of phases over the years:<br />

<p>1 - It's connection agnostic, let's get a bunch of DIA's from different ISP's and bundle them all together so we can get one fat pipe and not worry about circuit failover. We no longer need our big expensive MPLS circuits, and don't have to wait 2 months for $Large ISP.</p>

<ol>
<li><ul>
<li>Let's add some security features in the mix. A lot of these devices will be deployed in various locations/branches, we need to add some web filtering and scrubbing at the edge and not have to funnel everything to HQ. Now that many of us are working remote, let's also incorporate the use of a CASB (Content Access Security Broker) to ensure no matter where you are, office or coffee shop, we have you covered.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li>Now let's add some more smarts into the mix, instead of having a big, dumb fat pipe, we need to be aware of all of the flows, measure latency of each application end to end. We need application recognition and the ability to prioritize flows/traffic in detail without playing with the many different implementations of QoS.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>I may have them in the wrong order, or missed some key buzzwords.. but that's the basic idea. I think it will take time to mature, but for those who like to know exactly what's going on under the hood, it's a tough call.</p>
