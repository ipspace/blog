         "html": "<p>Great Post. But does MTU limitations factor into consideration? Our SP was previously looking to provide a layer 2 service across the internet and found that cisco in the last year has put some work into beefing up their MPLS over DMVPN solution on IOS-XE. While VXLAN makes more sense in DCs and even on campus networks what about larger networks? If my math is right using a MPLS over DMVPN with IPSEC enabled solution has less overhead than using VXLAN over DMVPN/IPSEC?</p>\n",

         "html": "<p>I witnessed a design proposal from DC guys where the entire inter-dc mpls-vpn dedicated backbone (i.e. the ethernet connectivity between P routers) was meant to be migrated over to a vxlan-based full-mesh of tunnels between gateways (I&#39;d call them P gateways) whose IP connectivity was provided by the main and already shared by mobile and fixed and business customers MPLS VPN backbone. Basically a vxlan-based overlaid inner backbone. A true folly. Thank god it didn&#39;t pass in the end. They laughed at us when we (backbone/transport engineers) proposed CsC as a solution. This use case fits I guess in the vxlan cathegory that Ivan called &quot;separation between edge (customer-facing) and core (transport) networks&quot; but with the customer being your DC guys and the Provider being your backbone guys as these two groups don&#39;t always trust each other. Thank god common sense transport still prevails at times.</p>\n",
