Our SP was previously looking to provide a layer 2 service across the internet and found that cisco in the last year has put some work into beefing up their MPLS over DMVPN solution on IOS-XE. While VXLAN makes more sense in DCs and even on campus networks what about larger networks? If my math is right using a MPLS over DMVPN with IPSEC enabled solution has less overhead than using VXLAN over DMVPN/IPSEC?</p>\n",

From the overhead perspective MPLS definitely makes more sense.</p>\n",
