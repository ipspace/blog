            <div class="comment-content"><p>Great Post. But does MTU limitations factor into consideration? Our SP was previously looking to provide a layer 2 service across the internet and found that cisco in the last year has put some work into beefing up their MPLS over DMVPN solution on IOS-XE. While VXLAN makes more sense in DCs and even on campus networks what about larger networks? If my math is right using a MPLS over DMVPN with IPSEC enabled solution has less overhead than using VXLAN over DMVPN/IPSEC?</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I honestly don&#39;t want to know anything about a layer-2 service across the Internet. Just the thought makes me shudder...</p>

<p>As for MPLS- or VXLAN-over-DMVPN, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen anyone using VXLAN yet, but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s about to change. From the overhead perspective MPLS definitely makes more sense.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I completely agree with you about the layer 2 service over the internet; just because you can do something doesn&#39;t mean you should. But I bet dollar to doughnuts that some SD-WAN vendor is going to offer it and market it as some great achievement. It wouldn&#39;t even be that hard for them since some of the vendors already use VXLAN as a transport technology. </p>

<p>I think the reason I have seen Cisco put deployment effort into fleshing out MPLS over DMVPN was since a client of their&#39;s, SpaceX, wanted to leverage it for some reason.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>People wanted to run MPLS-over-GRE-over-IPSec (and DMVPN is just a special use case) to build their own MPLS/VPN networks on top of public (or Service Provider) IP infrastructure for a long time. The usual reason is VRF scalability (= we don&#39;t want to have a different DMVPN tunnel for every VRF).</p>

<p>https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/03/mplsvpn-over-gre-over-ipsec-does-it.html</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just that the sane way of running MPLS-over-DMVPN wasn&#39;t well supported due to the way IP multicast/broadcast propagation works over DMVPN. I think I covered various scenarios in either DMVPN or Enterprise MPLS webinars.</p>
