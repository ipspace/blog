(evpn af activated). I don&#39;t see any value in running overlay peering in each customer VRF there... but I may be wrong ? Can you confirm or precise what peering type your were thinking of ? </p></li>\n<li><p>Imagine the case we have a ToR pair but without MLAG, running eBGP with downstream servers (i don&#39;t say it&#39;s good, but...). Would you run the same setup ? </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>eBGP seems fine overall as you don&#39;t deal with iBGP loop prevention rules and knobs, which is translated in a more straightforward configuration, but it does not change the fact that you have to clearly &quot;lock&quot; what the pair of switches advertise.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you, </p>\n",
