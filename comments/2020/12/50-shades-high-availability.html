            <div class="comment-content"><p>End-to-end high-availability is always the best, I fully agree. That is why in safety critical networks we have ED-137 linked session, or the 4-times-simulcasted ARTAS radar streams. </p>

<p>What is funny that even in-chassis redundancy in network devices still does not work well after three decades of development. We have daily problems that this feature or that feature is broken when there is an automated failover from one processor to the other. The background synchronization is difficult and they did no want to create a full transaction journalling, since that is expensive.</p>

<p>If you have to implement high-availability in the infrastructure, then it is a sign that the applications are not designed very well for this purpose. Keep in mind that your infrastructure HA solution is just a compensation control for the weaknesses of the application.</p>
