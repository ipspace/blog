            <div class="comment-content"><p>Fantastic wrap-up Ivan/Jeff!</p>

<p>I just wanted to add what we already discussed on this other previous blog @ https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/11/fast-failover-without-lfa-frr.html regarding the comparison between LFA/TI-LFA and Fast-rehash of ECMP-paths:</p>

<p>TI-LFA and LFA are much more than Fast-rehash of ECMP-paths as LFA techniques leverage a more sophisticated control-plane computation but in a link-protection only scenario ECMP fast-rehash is way better than LFA or TI-LFA in terms of the degree of flows-spraying especially if the number of flows per destination varies a lot (e.g. either systemic and/or in an IP tunnelling environment such as GTP, VxLAN and so fort). In this kind of environment in fact the high-end router could carry on spraying the tunnels&rsquo; destinations flows over the N-1 links left (I am assuming an high-end router chipset is capable of performing per-flow loadbalancing of mpls-encapsulated GTP or VxLAN traffic otherwise it is not an high-end router to me ) with fast-rehash rather than sending all of the flows of a tunnel destination over the single LFA/TI-LFA backup NH in order to provide fast link-protection.</p>

<p>Moreover, if both the protected link and the LFA-backup link went down, then LFA would actually and paradoxically provide &#39;fast discard&#39; while ECMP fast-rehash would correctly still provide fast link-protection over the N-2 ECMP links left. </p>

<p>I&#39;d be important if on high-end routers you could disable (with a knob rather than with complex LFA policies) LFA/TI-LFA in favour of ECMP fast-rehash when you require just fast link-protection in an ECMP scenario. </p>
