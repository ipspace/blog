            <div class="comment-content"><p>Have you looked at Suzieq since you had us on your show? https://github.com/netenglabs/suzieq. I think it&#39;s a better platform for gathering that kind of data than Ansible. I looked quickly at your examples and I think Suzieq already collects that data. It then stores it in a vendor neutral format, and allows you to easily ask questions, rather than having to write your own code. I think it&#39;s great for integrating into automation as pre/post check, but we need to do a better job of documenting how that would work and the advantages.</p>

<p>cheers,
Justin</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Justin! You know I love Suzieq, and if anyone ever asks me about a generic data gathering framework, Ansible would be pretty far down the list.</p>

<p>However, sometimes you need information from the device to validate your data model, or you want to do post-deployment validation using the same tool, or you want to grab some data and create a report without investing into yet-another platform, or...</p>

<p>In those cases, the hammer lying nearby is just what you need, even when you&#39;re dealing with squeaky disc brakes ;)</p>

            <div class="comment-content">It feels like you are trying to be practical : ) I appreciate your point of view and agree its good to let people know how to do these things. In general, I think this kind of data gathering is more general and people shouldn&#39;t think of it as one-off, they should figure out how to get this kind of data all the time.<br />

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hi there, <br />
This updated part is just another gem from Ivan. Thanks ever so much - much appreciated especially as pretty painful I guess.   </p>

<p>There is one thing I wanted to highlight from my part: <br />
Ivan showed that Nexus OS can render XML printouts into JSON but that, at least for some Nexus OS versions, single-row tables are rendered as JSON dictionaries while multi-row tables are rendered as JSON Lists. <br />
Well, I found the same issue (albeit not on the router but back on the Ansible host) on Junos (with the juniper_junos_command module and Ansible 2.5.0) on some &#39;deeper&#39; junos commands such as
&#39;show route forwarding-table destination DST table default extensive&#39; or &#39;show route PFX table inet.0 active-path&#39;. In that case in fact the &quot;nh&quot; info is either a JSON Dict or a List depending on whether the &#39;nh&#39; is just one or more than one respectively.  I guess the culprit must be the Ansible&#39;s juniper&#39;s module automatic translation of the returned XML printout into JSON performed with the help of the jmslease library ?  </p>

<p>Cheers/Ciao <br />
Andrea  </p>
