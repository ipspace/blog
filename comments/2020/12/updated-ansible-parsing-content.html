            <div class="comment-content"><p>Have you looked at Suzieq since you had us on your show? https://github.com/netenglabs/suzieq. I think it&#39;s a better platform for gathering that kind of data than Ansible. I looked quickly at your examples and I think Suzieq already collects that data. It then stores it in a vendor neutral format, and allows you to easily ask questions, rather than having to write your own code. I think it&#39;s great for integrating into automation as pre/post check, but we need to do a better job of documenting how that would work and the advantages.</p>

<p>cheers,
Justin</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Justin! You know I love Suzieq, and if anyone ever asks me about a generic data gathering framework, Ansible would be pretty far down the list.</p>

<p>However, sometimes you need information from the device to validate your data model, or you want to do post-deployment validation using the same tool, or you want to grab some data and create a report without investing into yet-another platform, or...</p>

<p>In those cases, the hammer lying nearby is just what you need, even when you&#39;re dealing with squeaky disc brakes ;)</p>
