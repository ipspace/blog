            <div class="comment-content"><p>Have you looked at Suzieq since you had us on your show? https://github.com/netenglabs/suzieq. I think it&#39;s a better platform for gathering that kind of data than Ansible. I looked quickly at your examples and I think Suzieq already collects that data. It then stores it in a vendor neutral format, and allows you to easily ask questions, rather than having to write your own code. I think it&#39;s great for integrating into automation as pre/post check, but we need to do a better job of documenting how that would work and the advantages.</p>

<p>cheers,
