I fail a master, switch 2, in a ten switch stack, and the standby takes over and it&#39;s now a 9 switch configuration, and the master is switch 7. It was a challenge in test, even with the ASIC architect a 30 second walk away, just to determine the test criteria in the lab... did this system do what was expected? We mostly relied on the Spirent counters, because in the lab, we had strict visibility of 100% of the traffic at the ends. This is the first time I&#39;m imagining the poor ops guy in front of a dashboard trying to figure out wtf just happened based upon streaming telemetry in that scenario.</p>\n",
