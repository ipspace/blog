For example interface name could be not recognized and device read several next lines belonging to previous recognized interface.\nWhen I need to do massive config change, I try to split this to several atomic update. This way takes more time to send updates to devices, but I found it less error prone.</p>\n",

Not much Ansible can do there - you have to take care of automated rollbacks.</p>\n",
