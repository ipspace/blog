I looked quickly at your examples and I think Suzieq already collects that data. It then stores it in a vendor neutral format, and allows you to easily ask questions, rather than having to write your own code. I think it&#39;s great for integrating into automation as pre/post check, but we need to do a better job of documenting how that would work and the advantages.</p>\n\n<p>cheers,\nJustin</p>\n",

You know I love Suzieq, and if anyone ever asks me about a generic data gathering framework, Ansible would be pretty far down the list.</p>\n\n<p>However, sometimes you need information from the device to validate your data model, or you want to do post-deployment validation using the same tool, or you want to grab some data and create a report without investing into yet-another platform, or...</p>\n\n<p>In those cases, the hammer lying nearby is just what you need, even when you&#39;re dealing with squeaky disc brakes ;)</p>\n",
