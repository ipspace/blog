BUT since ECMP is gone, TI-LFA will now calculate a backup path\nYou loose link #4: TI-LFA will provide fast failure, assuming there is another path available.</p>\n\n<p>I <em>think</em> the ECMP behavior is independent of the routing protocol, because it is implemented in CEF / hardware. But have not tested it properly with LDP / BGP etc. myself.</p>\n",
