            <div class="comment-content"><p>Yes you always learn from Ivan for he always covers the topics of the day very well with a great and sometimes humors perspective on things, plus his training is outstanding. </p>

<p>This is a great topic. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if this what was discussed prior but maybe some consideration on the types of failures should be covered initially to align with the discussion on when fast failover should occur?  Maybe a subcategory after item #1 For example  L1 failure with a low/med/high category for when fast fail is used plus upward/downward signaling.  Outline the  same for  L2-7 types. Maybe include a simple table of the common types of failures noted these days and align to the Fast Fail over approach expected to be used or when used.   When designing we need to know clearly when to &quot;go all in&quot; on fast fail over and when not to plus when to return to recovered state(the failure is corrected and original path is in use- no stickiness). Think dampening mechanisms or false negatives tripping off Fast Fail over.  This will tie nicely to the rest of the basics outline listed. </p>
