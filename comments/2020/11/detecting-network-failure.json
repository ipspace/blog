What I found regarding BFD is that in some implementations the trigger for the fast-rehashing at that higher level can be both an interface-down or a BFD session-down event but in other implementations it&rsquo;s the BFD session-down event only that triggers the ECMP fast-rehashing.    </p>\n\n<p>Ciao <br />\nAndrea  </p>\n",
