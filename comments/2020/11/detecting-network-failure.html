            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hi there,    </p>

<p>I just wanted to add a couple of BFD implementation info I have come across:    </p>

<p>1) some implementations make use of the central CPU to scale BFD up since they provide the central CPU with the very same forwarding ASIC that is on the cards while others use the CPU on the line cards  </p>

<p>2) BGP PIC-CORE implementation is, to me, very much ECMP fast-rehashing but at a higher indirection level of the hierarchical FIB as it applies to service/BGP prefixes in a BGP multipath scenario. What I found regarding BFD is that in some implementations the trigger for the fast-rehashing at that higher level can be both an interface-down or a BFD session-down event but in other implementations it&rsquo;s the BFD session-down event only that triggers the ECMP fast-rehashing.    </p>

<p>Ciao <br />
Andrea  </p>
