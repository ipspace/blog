            <div class="comment-content"><p>Related to the first point about point-to-point sessions in TCP, I would also add that OSPF neighbor discovery (via broadcast of Hello messages) is impossible to be implemented over TCP. You might replace IP multicast for multiple individual TCP sessions to disseminate LSA information (your first point), but you cannot implement neighbor discovery using TCP, because you need to know the other endpoint in order to establish the TCP connection.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I&#39;ve got a copy of &quot;OSPF: Anatomy of an Internet Routing Protocol&quot; by  John T Moy ISBN 0-201-63472-4.</p>

<p>I hope the quote below proves of interest. </p>

<p>Section 3.2 which discusses the choice of  encapsulation (Page 51 in my copy)</p>

<p>&quot;We did not need the reliability of TCP; link-state routing protocols have their own reliability built into the flooding algorithms, and TCP would just get in the way. Also, the ease of applications in UNIX and other operation systems to sent and receive UDP packets was seen by some as a disadvantage; the necessity of gaining OS privileges was seen as providing some small amount of security. The additional small benefits of UDP encapsulation were outweighed by the extra 8 bytes of UDP header overhead that would appear in every protocol packet. So we decided to run OSPF directly over the IP network layer, and we received an assignment of IP protocol number 89 from the IANA&quot;</p>
