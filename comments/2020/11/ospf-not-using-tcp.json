You might replace IP multicast for multiple individual TCP sessions to disseminate LSA information (your first point), but you cannot implement neighbor discovery using TCP, because you need to know the other endpoint in order to establish the TCP connection.</p>\n",

Also, the ease of applications in UNIX and other operation systems to sent and receive UDP packets was seen by some as a disadvantage; the necessity of gaining OS privileges was seen as providing some small amount of security. The additional small benefits of UDP encapsulation were outweighed by the extra 8 bytes of UDP header overhead that would appear in every protocol packet. So we decided to run OSPF directly over the IP network layer, and we received an assignment of IP protocol number 89 from the IANA&quot;</p>\n",
