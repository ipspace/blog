The most important part of the math here.<br /><br />I would say math is important just to eliminate those who are not smart enough...<br /><br />Joking.",

Even more most CCIEs that have seem to know very little about the science behind it on not to mention the math. Great topic as usual and first of a kind that i see  trying to bring some science into networking",
