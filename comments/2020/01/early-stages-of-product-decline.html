            <div class="comment-content">One thing that I&#39;ve found can make reading the tea leaves a little easier is to frequently make your vendor reps give you roadmap updates - say, every year or so.<br /><br />I did this a few years back when we were planning out a refresh of our Juniper/Trapeze wireless network to the up and coming new 11ac standard. I had our reps give us a roadmap, and it didn&#39;t consist of much more than adding the new standard to the APs and adding one to all the version numbers.  After a vendor comparison ended up going with Aruba instead. This proved to be the right decision a couple of weeks later, when Juniper announced they were canning that product line, stopping development on the new gear, and referring all wireless customers to Aruba.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi there, <br /><br />I would also add, as a further early stage hint that something might gonna go not as expected at some point, the sudden announcement from VendorX of a brand new backbone/SP router series that is not in continuity with the design (e.g. silicon, software and so forth) of the backbone/SP router series from the very same VendorX you happen to currently have in your network and with the main fear being that what you currently have in your backbone network is not gonna be further developed for the Backbone/SP space anymore but only for the Edge/SP space. <br /><br />Cheers<br />Andrea</div>
