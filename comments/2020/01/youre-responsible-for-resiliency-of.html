            <div class="comment-content">Amen! Public clouds don&#39;t put up with a lot of kludges enterprise admins are used to. <br /><br />Now every time I run into dreaded Microsoft Network Load Balancing (NLB), which is short is MS screwing around with Layer 2 and Layer 3 standards to provide a semblance of scale/redundancy, I love telling the administrators to stop using it because Microsoft doesn&#39;t even support it in their own Azure cloud offering! Let the application or a dedicated load-balancer handle it - please! :)<br /><br />I personally have less of a problem with vMotion - as for the most part it works as advertised without giving the network engineers too much headache. I was surprised to learn that LIVE vMotion is even supported between on-premise and Vmware on AWS Cloud - https://cloud.vmware.com/vmc-aws/faq#vmware-site-recovery - that&#39;s pretty crazy - I would love to know more details / mechanics about that!<br /><br />Looking forward to the course Ivan :)</div>
