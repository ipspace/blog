  html: Math? Do wee need more than the most important formula:n*(n-1)/2?<br /><br
    />Queuing/BW? Should we calculate something or simply throw in more BW?<br /><br
    />Logic. Yes, sure. The most important part of the math here.<br /><br />I would
    say math is important just to eliminate those who are not smart enough...<br /><br
    />Joking.

  html: I have been looking to the answer to this question fir over18 yrs since started
    career in networking. <br />Math is really hidden in all networking protocols.
    Even more most CCIEs that have seem to know very little about the science behind
    it on not to mention the math. Great topic as usual and first of a kind that i
    see  trying to bring some science into networking

    html: This is expert level that&#39;s why I mentioned n*(n-1)/2 ;)

  html: I&#39;m surprised nobody said binary arithmetic, I&#39;m sure that most of
    you had issues explaining how to create a proper subnet address planning , once
    people moves out of a /24 you start to see lot of funny things :-)

  html: 'I&#39;d use the cliche to answer the question: It depends.<br /><br />If
    one is working with more practical staffs, it&#39;s rare to use any math in projects.
    calc man-day would be one of the hardest things in math.<br /><br />But if they&#39;re
    things related to protocols and why they&#39;re better or worse than counterparts,
    it&#39;s impossible to understand them without math. e.g. nth-shortest path, queuing,
    and etc.'
