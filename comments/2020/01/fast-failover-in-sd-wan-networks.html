            <div class="comment-content">30 seconds is acceptable as a network level failover but it is noticeable.  I have been doing SDWAN installations in co-working spaces where there is a high reliance on interactive collaboration tools.  Any failed sessions are noticed and reported.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&quot;30 seconds is acceptable as a network level failover but it is noticeable.&quot; &lt;&lt; absolutely.<br /><br />But does the business care enough if that happens once a year (or once a month) that they&#39;d be willing to invest in a more expensive solution? Or would you be willing to support a more complex solution (which could break in many other ways) just to get around this?<br /><br />Obviously there&#39;s no right answer, I&#39;m just saying we should always consider the true business impact (and asking &quot;can I get more money to get this done&quot; is a good indicator of whether the business really cares).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">In our neck of the woods, fat finger and fat ass problems happens on a more regular basis than yearly or monthly!!!!<br />The first answer to will I spend more money is always no.  The next step is that when it happens, can a bully the ISP to fix it immediately?  The next step when they discover the ISP small print and that there really isn&#39;t the SLA that they thought they had is to put in the solution because by now they have worked out how much money is being lost.<br />The fundamental problem is they don&#39;t know what it costs until it is experienced.  Secondly, no amount of subjective argument is going to fix the problem.<br />I haven&#39;t met the business that doesn&#39;t care about an outage.  Would love the examples.</div>
