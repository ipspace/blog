Slow and expensive. ",

Unless you want to use BGP for dynamic routing there are much simpler options than IPsec VPN tunnels between hub appliance and spoke VPCs, using either transit gateway in hub-and-spoke configuration, or simple VPC peering.<br /><br />As for using ipSpace account for comments - that&#39;s been on my to-do list for years. Unfortunately there&#39;s always something more urgent or important to do, like creating new content... but eventually I&#39;ll get there, I promise!",
