  html: "I think \u201Cfail fast, fail often\u201D get\u2019s a bad rap because it\u2019\
    s perceived has meaning \u201Cbe wreckless\u201D while it\u2019s really intended\
    \ to mean (and should be worded as, imho) \u201Cfail early/small, try/test often\u201D\
    .  As such, it\u2019s actually sound engineering and business advice...  Don\u2019\
    t wait until the very end of a project to learn that it won\u2019t work and where\
    \ fixing it (if possible) will be much more costly...<br /><br /><br />"

  html: 'And what about making proper design, in the first place.<br />On the opposite
    side, I prefer to (quoting Linus):<br />&quot;do it right way.&quot;<br />I can
    only add: &quot;, first time&quot;.<br />Of course there will be mistakes, we
    are all humans,<br />but bad design will generate endless technical debt.<br />And
    there is no escape from that.'
