  html: Amen! Public clouds don&#39;t put up with a lot of kludges enterprise admins
    are used to. <br /><br />Now every time I run into dreaded Microsoft Network Load
    Balancing (NLB), which is short is MS screwing around with Layer 2 and Layer 3
    standards to provide a semblance of scale/redundancy, I love telling the administrators
    to stop using it because Microsoft doesn&#39;t even support it in their own Azure
    cloud offering! Let the application or a dedicated load-balancer handle it - please!
    :)<br /><br />I personally have less of a problem with vMotion - as for the most
    part it works as advertised without giving the network engineers too much headache.
    I was surprised to learn that LIVE vMotion is even supported between on-premise
    and Vmware on AWS Cloud - https://cloud.vmware.com/vmc-aws/faq#vmware-site-recovery
    - that&#39;s pretty crazy - I would love to know more details / mechanics about
    that!<br /><br />Looking forward to the course Ivan :)
