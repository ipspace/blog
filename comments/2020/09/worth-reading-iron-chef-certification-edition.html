            <div class="comment-content"><p>Last year I failed CCIE Security lab and they were using a completely different approach.
1. Instead of creating difficult tasks, create a million of simple ones
2. Instead of preconfiguring essential things (like addresses, VRFs and routing), give a completely blank device, so that a candidate would spend more time
3. Is it a security lab? Introduce errors in tasks that are not related to security (for example, shut down all WiFi radio interfaces in WiFi+ISE task), and that your candidate might be not familiar with.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I had an engineer colleague who was in love with his in-depth knowledge, and always created complex designs even if he could kept it simple (I&#39;m talking about DC networks, not MPLS TE). Albeit I told him many times, he couldn&#39;t understand what &quot;KISS&quot; means and he always had to redesign his masterpieces when handing them over to operations (large organization, not a small startup where he operates his whole environment).</p>

<p>Please note I&#39;m not belittling people who have CCIE. They&#39;re very skilled networkers but I think the majority of their extensive knowledge is only valuable in corner cases.</p>
