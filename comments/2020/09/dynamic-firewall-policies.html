            <div class="comment-content">There is one more important drawback to this dynamic solution:<br />
The infected PC would probably ask the firewall to allow all IPs on all ports. No, I don&#39;t want that.<br />

            <div class="comment-content"><p>If you trust the host to be able to decide its own security policy, then the only firewall policy you need is &quot;if dst.ip == X then allow&quot;. The only thing a more granular firewall policy would give you is to drop rejected packets one or two hops sooner :)</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Service mesh can be an interesting option here - where each application announces its service(s) to the service registry, with corresponding ACLs. That removes the gap between applications &amp; firewall owners, and it simplifies the cleanup process (which rarely happens in many enterprises).</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>The idea for the host to control its own security is bad as mentioned by Steffann</p>

<p>What have been done in the past are distributed host agents firewalls. Here are the benefits:
 - Host has visibility on user connected and program launched. You can define your rules based on programm name rather than classical UDP/TCP/IP tuple.
 - Distributed Load. Its easier to distribute the load when you apply the filtering policies on the hosts directly
 - Traffic filtering on the same subnet is possible. </p>

<p>As always, there are drawbacks. 
 - Manage another software agent can be problematic (think different OS versions like RHEL 6,  RHEL 8 and what to do with that business critical FreeBSD who has no agent available?)
 - Policies are harder to define and manage 
 - IP filtering at the subnet level does not immune you to L2 attacks.</p>
