            <div class="comment-content"><p>In my opinion one can start protecting critical network infrastructure from the very beginning. </p>

<p>We know what are DNS servers for protected host, don&rsquo;t we? We know as well that usually local DNS server are forwarders. </p>

<p>So it is possible to filter in host security policy outgoing DNS to permitted servers only. The same applies to NTP servers. </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Good blog!</p>

<p>I have a cynical comment to make: I have NEVER found a customer application team that can tell me all the servers they are using, their IP addresses, let alone the ports they use. The <em>few</em> times I&#39;ve gotten actual documentation produced by the vendor who installed the app or the in-house team who wrote the app, the alleged documentation covers things like DB schemes, but not network flows. </p>

<p>It&#39;s worse than that. My coworkers tell me that actually tracking down app owners is all too often excruciatingly painful, in part because their is no list of owners and contact info. And often they don&#39;t know much other than their next support or license renewal date. </p>

<p>This not only hinders making FW rules, but it really hinders troubleshooting app problems. Yet no site I&#39;ve seen is pro-active about it. </p>

<p>This has made me a big believer in products like Tetration and <strong>getting the actual flows documented to secure the servers and be ready in advance of application troubleshooting</strong>.</p>
