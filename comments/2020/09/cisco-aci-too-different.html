            <div class="comment-content"><p>I like Application Centric Infrastructure, for this &quot;application centric&quot; approach... and you have to go along this path to find it very useful.
I consider EPGs and contracts, just like security groups and rules inside AWS, there are very loosely tied to network construct (IP address, subnetting/routing, ...).
When designing an ACI Fabric, we try to go along this philopsophy and make decision along this path.</p>

<p>Yes, we took several hours to find naming convention for every type of objects in ACI because it is object-oriented.</p>

<p>And, to be really transparent, when starting with ACI, you have to think about automation at the beginning (even if you don&#39;t automate at first), it has to come quickly, in order to leverage the abstract ACI offers. That&#39;s where API First is a real thing and ACI gives you all the tool (API inspector) to go API.</p>

<p>We have now architects and developpers that can define their architectures logically without any IP-related information, and provision all EPGs and contracts (and ...) with API calls, from a JSON/YAML/CSV/xls description file.</p>

<p>And so, I would&#39;nt recommand ACI if you want to stay in a &quot;network-centric&quot; mode, I agree.</p>
