            <div class="comment-content"><p>I&#39;m working on a greenfield rule-base for an internal segmentation project and whilst we have an ML tool which is analysing flows from the past 6 months, there are heaps of gaps. For example, we have standby file shares in our DR site; none of these hosts came up on the report. Another issue is whether the flow itself is even legitimate to begin with. Sure there&#39;s an RDP flow from a workstation to a server, but that could very well be nefarious. In any case, having this data is a good starting point, not for creating policy but to start the discussion with the relevant application owners.</p>
