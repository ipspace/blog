Instead of preconfiguring essential things (like addresses, VRFs and routing), give a completely blank device, so that a candidate would spend more time\n3. Is it a security lab? Introduce errors in tasks that are not related to security (for example, shut down all WiFi radio interfaces in WiFi+ISE task), and that your candidate might be not familiar with.</p>\n",
