Instead of preconfiguring essential things (like addresses, VRFs and routing), give a completely blank device, so that a candidate would spend more time\n3. Is it a security lab? Introduce errors in tasks that are not related to security (for example, shut down all WiFi radio interfaces in WiFi+ISE task), and that your candidate might be not familiar with.</p>\n",

Albeit I told him many times, he couldn&#39;t understand what &quot;KISS&quot; means and he always had to redesign his masterpieces when handing them over to operations (large organization, not a small startup where he operates his whole environment).</p>\n\n<p>Please note I&#39;m not belittling people who have CCIE.
