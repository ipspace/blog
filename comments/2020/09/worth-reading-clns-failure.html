            <div class="comment-content"><p>&quot;The biggest problem of CLNP addresses was the variable address length&quot;.</p>

<p>I think this is wrong. You might wanna ask someone who was involved with cisco&#39;s SSE (the Silicon Switch Engine in the cisco 7000, from the mid-nineties). E.g. Tony Li worked on the microcode, if I&#39;m not mistaken. IPv4 and CLNS were both sse-switched. Performance was equal. Somewhere around 150k-200k pps, if I recall correctly (this was 25 years ago, pfff, so excuse me if I have the number wrong).</p>

<p>The SSE was proof that variable-length addresses were very viable. Personally I think variable-length addresses are better than fixed-length addresses. I think the majority of routing guys at cisco at the time thought so. After all, they supported TUBA as well.</p>

<p>&quot;TCP/IP folks focused on getting something done&quot;. I think it&#39;s more precise to say: &quot;some TCP/IP folks focused on getting things done&quot;. E.g. the folks at cisco who supported variable-length addresses. The majority of TCP/IP folks were/are just as clueless, or imagination-less, as the majority of OSI folks were. Proof ? IPv6. Imho the whole history of IPv6 is not that much different from the history of OSI. Lots of talk, little code and little deployment. At least some parts of the OSI stack had smart ideas in them.</p>
