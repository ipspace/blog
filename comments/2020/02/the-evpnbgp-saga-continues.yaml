  html: I fully agree. The classic IGP+iBGP combination is well tested and works fine
    in many scenarios. Inventing new solutions when encountering new problems is fine,
    but inventing stuff to be &quot;hip&quot; is just asking for trouble.

    html: This is just because you happen to have apps that need to be routed in the
      underlay and you do not want to deal with IGP/BGP redistribution because it
      adds no value to the network infrastructure.  Just to name a few (NSX, multicast
      apps ). And it will be overkill to run geneve upon vxlan for the first or not
      been able to make the apps working for the last (while waiting to get a working
      EVPN RT-6 to 8 implementation).

  html: "Just my personal opinion, but I fail to understand why we need to build the\
    \ underlay with BGP. I get that manufacturers have gone to great lengths to improve\
    \ BGP failover times, but everyone acts like OSPF and IS-IS are boring dead protocols\
    \ that confuse people.<br /><br />I actually prefer IS-IS because it\u2019s existence\
    \ before IP pervasiveness meant it doesn\u2019t rely on IP to function. If VXLAN\
    \ is the new layer2, why burn a bunch of time addressing interfaces in your underlay.\
    \ OSPFv3 a la IPv6 Link Local SLAAC or the simplicity of a loopback and ip unnumbered\
    \ on IS-IS makes Zero Touch way simpler. Less state for the fabric to maintain,\
    \ and Link state protocols provide a explicit border because when you touch another\
    \ fabric or the border of your lab you use EBGP anyhow... but maybe I\u2019m just\
    \ old school."

    html: Would love to hear why eBGP in the underlay would converge faster and/or
      better than IS-IS or OSPF (assuming similar quality of implementation)... and
      thanks for the dynamic flooding pointer!

    html: Hi Andrea,<br /><br />I wonder where &quot;only viable option in big DCs&quot;
      comes from? Well-designed OSPF was good enough for networks with tens of thousands
      of nodes, and as Dinesh Dutt explained in Software Gone Wild episode 92, there
      are very large environments happily running OSPF or IS-IS.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br

    html: "Hello Ivan,<br />To be honest with you, when I saw all that effort in defining\
      \ new routing protocols for ultra-dense topologies, I assumed there must had\
      \ been a clear and strong requirement within the industry/academia fuelling\
      \ all that effort. My assumption got even stronger with the evidence of seeing\
      \ so many deployments with eBGP as the CLOS underlay protocol. What I did not\
      \ know (I have just listened Dinesh on the Software Gone Wild episode 92 as\
      \ you pointed out) is that well engineered multi-level/multi-area ISIS and OSPF\
      \ implementations build the underlay of pretty big/dense multi-pod/IGP_Area\
      \ CLOS production networks today. Well, this makes me even happier then as I\
      \ am a big fan of the IGP+BGP approach to the underlay/overlay L2/L3 transport\
      \ layout !!<br /><br />Having said that though Ivan and thinking of OSPF here,\
      \ I am guessing that a better IGP for dense topologies would have allowed those\
      \ very same implementations that Dinesh mentioned in the podcast to actually\
      \ be built as single area IGP Fabric which is way easier than multi-area design\
      \ \u2013 not to mention how happy traditional TE and SR-TE would be too. I also\
      \ wonder if the OSPF implementation on some of the newer vendors in this space\
      \ (i.e. not the usual suspect 4/5 vendors) is mature enough for a production\
      \ network especially acting as the OSPF ABRs for instance. So, a \u2018dense-topology\u2019\
      \ IGP would therefore I guess make life easier (and thus cheaper) for the code\
      \ as well in this regard as it would allow a single-area design ?? <br />The\
      \ other aspect I am not sure about regarding the eBGP as the underlay is that\
      \ it has always seemed to me as if it was yet a further chance for the vendor\
      \ X to sell you an automation engine (culture and products) too in order to\
      \ deal with the additional proliferation of BGP policies and config\u2026.<br\
      \ />Having said that, a better IGP might not be currently needed (we should\
      \ see what the guys working on it think...Jeff ??) but I guess we should still\
      \ take this as an opportunity to start working now on an a better IGP for future\
      \ use ?  <br /><br />Cheers and keep smiling<br />Andrea<br />"

  html: Hi there, <br />I reckon Juniper has just applied its native SP knowledge
    and way of architecting L2/L3 transport services to the DC but within the boundaries
    of possibly some of the boxes&#39; limitation. Some others such as Cumulus had
    the ability and the chance/will to go beyond an SP-to-DC configuration adaptation
    and managed if am not mistaken to ultra-simplify the fabric overlay and underlay
    configuration/complexity with just inter-IPv6_Link-Local address unnumbered eBGP
    sessions carrying multiple BGP families (tipically IPv4 for the underlay and VPNv4/EVPN
    for the overlay) which I find marvellously elegant and simple/compact and therefore
    less expensive to manage and operate. <br /> <br />Regarding the eBGP building
    the underlay, it is just the WRONG protocol for that purpose but it is the only
    viable option currently in big DC (Medium/small DCs I reckon are not excused !!!).
    The underlay IS THE job for an IGP but the industry needs an IGP thought/designed
    for dense topologies such those present in big fabrics. Furthermore, with the
    IGP in the DC/Fabric, Segment Routing would follow naturally/natively too and
    it would also be possible to think of deploying Fabric topologies other than CLOS
    that can provide even densier topologies for, say, even lower-latencies requirements.
    <br /><br />Cheers and keep smiling<br />Andrea<br />

    html: Dear Aldrin,<br /><br />Rereading what I wrote, I have to admit that even
      though I waited a long while before writing the blog post (and then toned it
      down), I used more colorful language than usual... but it makes me immensely
      sad and bitter when I see excellent engineers making spurious technical arguments
      to justify (what seems to me to be) product marketing decisions that I simply
      can&#39;t agree with.<br /><br />I apologize if I offended anyone with a direct
      and somewhat harsh opinion (I was never known for my diplomatic skills), and
      hope we&#39;ll find a technical topic in the future where our opinions won&#39;t
      be so opposite, as I always enjoyed the technical discussions we had.<br /><br
      />Kind regards,<br />Ivan

    html: "There\u2019s only so much of the picture that can fit in the comments section.\
      \  The grander EVPN story starts with its background and continued evolution\
      \ across multiple domains and use cases.  What is being called out here is a\
      \ very specific data center reference design doc \u2014 there\u2019s a story\
      \ behind that too, and it\u2019s not marketing.  <br /><br />For example, a\
      \ key goal of that doc is to expose what our fabric controller is driving under\
      \ the covers.  It starts with the basic use case of a simple IP fabric.   Some\
      \ folks don\u2019t need overlays.  OSPF/ISIS is not ideal for very large fabrics\
      \ so EBGP was chosen to avoid deploying different solutions for different size\
      \ IP fabrics in the same company (think large enterprise or SP with many fabrics\
      \ of different sizes geographically dispersed).  Not perfect either, so meanwhile\
      \ Tony P (Juniper) invented RIFT, which sparked other fabric optimized IGP efforts\
      \ in the IETF (Juniper was behind EVPN too \u2014 https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-raggarwa-mac-vpn-01).\
      \  When one of these land we would swap out EBGP in the solution.  However operators\
      \ are free to replace EBGP with OSPF or ISIS if they see fit (and understand\
      \ the flooding inefficiencies in large dense topologies).  I started my comment\
      \ in the original blog with this statement, which you ignored in this blog.<br\
      \ /><br />Then we added the overlay use case on top of the IP fabric use case\
      \ solution.  Many of our larger customers don\u2019t want ANY overlay/tenant\
      \ state in P routers (control or data plane).  So instead of the controller\
      \ pushing different solutions for different customer types and fabric sizes\
      \ (this too is complexity) we chose to keep it consistent given the outcome\
      \ is the same in every case.  In fact some customers have hosts in overlays\
      \ and hosts in the underlay simultaneously, since only a subset of their endpoints\
      \ need to be segmented away from the larger set, and/or they are migrating to\
      \ host-based overlays or cloud-native application models. <br /><br />The controller\
      \ hides the verbosity (explicit config), but when operator has to troubleshoot,\
      \ detail is there under the covers.  No magic that leads to incorrect assumptions\
      \ at a time of sheer panic.  I ran a very large production network for 20 years\
      \ and rejected special sauce for this reason.  We provided a doc that exposes\
      \ what we do under the controller.  That\u2019s all.  It\u2019s not marketing.\
      \  You too have blogged many times about knowing your network. How can you know\
      \ it if you can\u2019t see it?<br /><br />There\u2019s more to the story that\
      \ I hope we can talk about first.  It\u2019s not all black and white. "
