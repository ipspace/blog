  html: Thank you, Ivan, for this enormous effort of discussion over the years! I
    perceive it as a good step in technology development. :)<br /><br />We can&#39;t
    resist broken wheels because in that sense every protocol and solution is broken.
    Is LISP a cache-based mechanism? Yes, but the control-plane or controls in the
    app can tame it. Ok, let&#39;s use something else. OTV? The end to end loop can
    kill it. Just a few supported HW causes still too large xSTP domains. VXLAN? Without
    the control-plane, there is a flood and learn behaviour, limited multihoming.
    EVPN? The best if not spanning L2. Otherwise, detection of L2 data-plane loops
    can also cause a headache. Don&#39;t use overlays and back to spanning-tree? Still,
    with these limitations, I would prefer overlays for several reasons.<br /><br
    />A generation by generation next broken wheels are giving more options for ubiquitous
    applications. It doesn&#39;t mean that networking is simpler. The other way around,
    it is way more complicated! Today we can have three embedded VXLAN overlays at
    the same time like VM based K8s Flannel over host-based NSX VXLAN over the access
    switch EVPN VXLAN. Why? Because three different departments can take care of their
    parts of the infrastructure. Is it good or bad? It depends. As always, there are
    tradeoffs. In my opinion, as to the network architects, we should proactively
    reach business, application and developers&#39; levels to ask for their needs,
    to get sync with them, to educate each other and try to work out a subjectively
    right solution. We don&#39;t need to afraid of broken solutions. We should be
    afraid of living in silos. Then a waste of time may happen when developers reinvent
    VLANs with the same broken story we already had.

  html: Ivan, this is the quote of the year!!!   &quot;IT seems to be one of the few
    areas where we allow people to build sandcastles and ignore the tides, and then
    blame someone else when the water inevitable arrives.&quot;  And it rhymes.....

      off customer gullibility and workarounds.

    html: at least try to separate security segregation from network designs. All
      the sudden half (more?) needs to build an overlay falls off the requirements
      table.

  html: If only we could finally start solving problems where they really exist (poor
    app/system design?) instead building tons of workarounds...

  html: With a blank sheet of paper, of course, the correct answer is that a work
    queue in an application shard is given an identity when it is created, and those
    application shards allowed to send to that work queue are given a capability (in
    the capabilities architecture of the 1970s sense) to that queue.  Part of instantiating
    a particular application shard in a particular place is updating whatever forwarding
    tables are necessary.<br /><br />The concept of overlay then becomes simply one
    of application naming.  The concept of underlay becomes one of moving payload
    from authorized sender-applications to application-receive-queues.  And the concept
    of containers, VMs, OS instances, hypervisors, or anything else having any role
    in the data plane becomes an implementation choice inferior to simply giving the
    application direct access.<br /><br />Who will get this to critical mass and in
    what decade?  Who knows?  But the status quo is broken, and we all know it.

  html: That Martin is now at a VC, looking for &quot;powerful, disruptive ideas often
    were once bad ideas&quot;, more than explains his reaction ...

  html: LISP is incomplete and not perfect and cannot make wonders. However, its latest
    variant is the only hybrid push/pull routing protocol that is available commercially
    on a large scale and also in reasonable open source implementations. Without enough
    flexibility you cannot build a good generic solution. Exclusively push or poll
    architectures have very strong limitations. <br />There are some outstanding issues
    with LISP, such as selective subscription and cache management by external applications
    (so you could fit into the TCAM resources even when you have policy based routing).<br
    />If you need &quot;seamless&quot; mobility, still LISP is your best friend. We
    could achive below 5 ms vertical handovers and failover switching in simple scenarios.
    But you really have to understand what is going under the hood for this. Large
    scale testing is still an open issue.<br />Global mobility with BGP has no chance
    to come to that performance level. Even with significant money incentives, the
    best BGP experts could not fine tune to that handover or failover speed. A few
    hundred ms was their best result.<br />You always have to make compromises, but
    if you do not have the toolsets to express your policies, then you will have no
    success. In LISP at least we have some chance to further improve. <br />Without
    active probing you cannot have a reasonable assurance that you would be able to
    forward your packets. But even probing has some time expiration, so at the time
    you are actually sending, the situation might be already different. You cannot
    avoid backholing perfectly...<br />In most cases, we have excess bandwidth, so
    critical services could use simulcast on independent paths. This is the way, how
    radar surveillance and air traffic control voice works. But classical best stream
    selection has its limits, so we have to move to packet by packet deduplication
    or combination (network coding, etc.). It is not without challenges, but it could
    give a reasonable improvement, since the probability of really receiving your
    packet will increase significantly. It has a price in resource consumption, but
    in some cases you are willing to pay for that...<br /><br /><br />
