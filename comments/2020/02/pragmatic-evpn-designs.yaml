  html: When I was a consultant I was making a good living using your principles.
    :-) Just configure back everything to the vendor reference design, since that
    was the best tested configuration. :-) That is so true... <br />I always had an
    explanation. In California, you want to deliver quick and dirty, since the girls
    are waiting for you at the beach... :-) So testing is limited to the very minimum...
    Never forget this... :-) :-) :-)<br /><br />
