      "html": "My guess.. in DMVPN, the later iterations eliminated large portions of state by leveraging phase 2 and phase 3 DMVPN (shortcut and spoke to spoke route exchange) making DMVPN nearly stateless (except for NHRP and IKE.) This drastically increased performance and scalability.<br /><br />Now in SDWAN we\u2019re putting all that state and more back into the mix so we can divert traffic per class or flow based on heuristics gathered about packets that arrive in that class or flow. I intend on doing a writeup when we do our PoC of the major players at the end of the year. ",
