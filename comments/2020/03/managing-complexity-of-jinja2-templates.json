One thing I'm not sure about and wanted to ask you:\n  tasks:\n  - template: src=/home/ht/NetOpsworkshop/Ansible/Includes/ios/common.j2 dest=/etc/ansible/configs/{{ inventory_hostname }}.txt</p>\n\n<p>Why can I not have the src &amp; dest as a list of dictionaries?\n- src: /src_path/\n- dest: /dest_path/</p>\n\n<p>What logic am I missing? Overall, I think your training sessions are beyond anything I have ever come across. So, a big thank you!</p>\n",

Where to use dict of dicts vs list of dicts. Or am I even asking the right question? I will stop obsessing and wait. Thanks.</p>\n",
