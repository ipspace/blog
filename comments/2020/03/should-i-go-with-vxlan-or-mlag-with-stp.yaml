  html: 'The biggest headache is the migration.  Maintain a legacy production environment
    and design something new, whatever it may be, and wherever it may be, and not
    have it break, when you turn off the old and turn on the new.<br />The old invariably
    has STP and the new does not.<br />I&#39;ve seen these as Groundhog projects as
    everything dies and the they start all over again, multiple times. '

      \ FIB programming aren&#39;t the same. Just saying..."

    html: "&quot;EVPN is complex and flaky&quot; &lt;&lt; and that&#39;s why I wrote\
      \ &quot;you don\u2019t have to run EVPN&quot; and &quot;you\u2019ll be equally\
      \ well off having a static VXLAN flood list&quot;. Am I becoming so abstruse\
      \ that everyone misunderstands what I write?<br /><br />As for &quot;use a single\
      \ switch&quot;, I would use two not one, but otherwise I completely agree with\
      \ you (and have recommended that path for years)."

  html: Ah, I finally have a chance to disagree with Ivan! ;-) EVPN is complex and
    flaky. If your enterprisey enterpriseware is designed for a circa 2000 AD enterprise
    network... just give it what it wants. Or heck, with 100 servers just use a single
    switch.
