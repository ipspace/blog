            <div class="comment-content"><p>On the topic of whitelist-based IP filtering what is the best approach in scanning public IPs that are candidates? This is for whitelisting with the intend to reject or allow the address. Have you run into tools, sites or some places that are legit and do the job right.</p>

<p>Once the process is defined and set the fun part will be to automate or script it further.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance</p>
