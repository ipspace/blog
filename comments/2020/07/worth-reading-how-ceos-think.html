            <div class="comment-content">Words from Daniel Dibb:<br />

<p>&quot;The next time your management claims IT is not your core business, remind them that Maersk, a shipping and logistics giant founded in 1904, with 35 billion revenue anually, almost went out of business due to ransomware affecting AD and Windows env. IT IS your core business.&quot;</p>

<p>Sometimes the CxO&#39;s need to be reminded before %$#@ hits the fan. And there&#39;s no better time than now, just ask Garmin.</p>

<p>In fact, I would argue that a solid security scheme can be executed with a mix of open source software and hardening your existing server configs. No need to wait for your next unicorn budget, make do with what you already have. Focus on the Mitre A@ttack framework&#39;s point of entries. Forget the silver bullet, work at improving what you already have in place, get visibility and logging in place (nxlog, sysmon, graylog is a great start).</p>

<p>If you absolutely need to buy that fancy box, make sure you look at what&#39;s already out there 1st. (Security onion, opnsense, graylog, efa, helk, and many more. )</p>
