There's absolutely no way a reasoned argument will persuade religious zealots.</p>\n\n<p>\"are you more experienced than vendor's principal engineers\" &lt;&lt; No. But...</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Do I have a different perspective? Yes - they focus on building their products and inventing new technologies that will differentiate their products, I focus on stable networks.</li>\n<li>Do I have different experience? Yes - they see crazy customer problems waiting to be \"solved\" (instead of incinerated with napalm), I see network meltdowns.</li>\n<li>Do I have different priorities? Yes - they have to create the best possible tool based on 20 years of legacy code, I have to select the best tool for the job (regardless of which vendor gets the P/O).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also, assuming the vendor's principal engineers are focused on creating the best possible solution, there's a layer of marketing and sales between them and the customer, and those layers add a different spin - while I'm focused on long-term customer success and network stability, most of them have a product to sell and a deal to close.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously there are people who don't get the nuances like this, in which case it's better to spend your time and energy somewhere else.</p>\n",
