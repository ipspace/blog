            <div class="comment-content"><p>I can&rsquo;t agree more but when you present tour idea to a bunch of people that follow only what vendors say you become like an idiot that try to reinvent the wheel.</p>

<p>Long story short as you say: are you more experienced than vendor&rsquo;s principal engineers?</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>&quot;when you present tour idea to a bunch of people that follow only what vendors say you become like an idiot that try to reinvent the wheel&quot; &lt;&lt; at which point you walk away and start looking for other opportunities. There&#39;s absolutely no way a reasoned argument will persuade religious zealots.</p>

<p>&quot;are you more experienced than vendor&#39;s principal engineers&quot; &lt;&lt; No. But...</p>

<ul>
<li>Do I have a different perspective? Yes - they focus on building their products and inventing new technologies that will differentiate their products, I focus on stable networks.</li>
<li>Do I have different experience? Yes - they see crazy customer problems waiting to be &quot;solved&quot; (instead of incinerated with napalm), I see network meltdowns.</li>
<li>Do I have different priorities? Yes - they have to create the best possible tool based on 20 years of legacy code, I have to select the best tool for the job (regardless of which vendor gets the P/O).</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, assuming the vendor&#39;s principal engineers are focused on creating the best possible solution, there&#39;s a layer of marketing and sales between them and the customer, and those layers add a different spin - while I&#39;m focused on long-term customer success and network stability, most of them have a product to sell and a deal to close.</p>

<p>Obviously there are people who don&#39;t get the nuances like this, in which case it&#39;s better to spend your time and energy somewhere else.</p>
