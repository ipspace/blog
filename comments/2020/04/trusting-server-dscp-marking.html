            <div class="comment-content"><p>If its the same company then, there is no way to be able to do that</p>

<p>Specially when you are marking on DC for the traffic to be prioritized on the WAN.</p>

<p>Generally, WAN Link will have less BW than inside your DC</p>

<p>For example, if you police for D1 Class at 100Mbps on every server interface, and you have 10000 Servers and your WAN is 1Gbps, then there is no way to protect the WAN with that, how then can we trust DSCP from DC in this case ?</p>

<p>&quot;No trust&quot; Unless coming from specific source is less risky :)</p>
