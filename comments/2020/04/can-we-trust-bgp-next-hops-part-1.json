If your BGP peering (regardless of whether it is iBGP or eBGP, even though the latter is the recommended best practice), then  fast externall fallover will immediately kill the neighbor and flush all routes which it learned from that neighbor.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, none of these features will protect you against gray SW/HW failures, such as faulty line card which still appears as UP but is not actually forwarding any traffic. </p>\n",
