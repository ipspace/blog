I used spine and leaf groups and spine and leaf roles.</p>\n\n<p>Since the spines treat all the leafs as RRCs, I figured I could just use roles and when the spine role is run, I take advantage of hostvars and the fact the leafs are grouped already. So I loop through each device and as long as its in the leafs group its the route-reflector-client option. It works but I am not even sure how to gauge the &quot;IAC-ness&quot; of this solution. Thoughts?</p>\n\n<pre>\r\n$ cat roles/bgp-spine/tasks/main.yaml \r\n- name: Configure BGP Neighbors with EVPN AF\r\n  nxos_bgp_neighbor_af:\r\n    asn: &quot;65000&quot;\r\n    neighbor: &quot;&#123;&#123; item.value.routerid &#125;&#125;&quot;\r\n    afi: l2vpn\r\n    safi: evpn\r\n    send_community: both\r\n    route_reflector_client: yes\r\n    state: present\r\n  loop: &quot;&#123;&#123; hostvars|dict2items &#125;&#125;&quot;\r\n  when: item.key in item.value.groups.leafs\r\n</pre>\n",

         "html": "<p>Nothing wrong with your solution. Instead of modeling the BGP sessions with a data model (like I did), you decided to make them part of the business logic (<em>every leaf is a route reflector of every spine</em>), and of course that&#39;s as IaC-y as it gets... it&#39;s just that your data model is at a higher layer of abstraction than mine.</p>\n\n<p>As for the implementation: unless they radically improved Ansible network modules (fat chance) calling <strong>nxos_bgp_neighbor_af</strong> might get slow for a large number of leaf switches, as it executes <strong>show running</strong> every time you&#39;re calling the module.</p>\n",
