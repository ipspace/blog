            <div class="comment-content"><p>Wow, I feel like I was on this same journey this week, glad I popped in :) I was trying to do the same thing this week and trying to do it without having any specific attribute called route reflector or rr-client (not sure why, just my feeling at the time). I used spine and leaf groups and spine and leaf roles.</p>

<p>Since the spines treat all the leafs as RRCs, I figured I could just use roles and when the spine role is run, I take advantage of hostvars and the fact the leafs are grouped already. So I loop through each device and as long as its in the leafs group its the route-reflector-client option. It works but I am not even sure how to gauge the &quot;IAC-ness&quot; of this solution. Thoughts?</p>

$ cat roles/bgp-spine/tasks/main.yaml

  nxos_bgp_neighbor_af:
    asn: &quot;65000&quot;

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Nothing wrong with your solution. Instead of modeling the BGP sessions with a data model (like I did), you decided to make them part of the business logic (<em>every leaf is a route reflector of every spine</em>), and of course that&#39;s as IaC-y as it gets... it&#39;s just that your data model is at a higher layer of abstraction than mine.</p>

<p>As for the implementation: unless they radically improved Ansible network modules (fat chance) calling <strong>nxos_bgp_neighbor_af</strong> might get slow for a large number of leaf switches, as it executes <strong>show running</strong> every time you&#39;re calling the module.</p>
