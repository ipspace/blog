            <div class="comment-content"><p>This looks interesting especially if it covers monolithic vs. non et al. I recall books such as Inside Cisco IOS Architecture that would cover the internals of the OS. This looks like a great course to provide more insight  to plan for better purpose build type architectures and product selection.  </p>

<p>As an old school guy the title of the course threw me for a second.  Us old school guys early 80s on(well me at least) when hearing the term &quot;network OS&quot; think of  Novell Netware, Banyan vines, MS-Lan Manager, etc. an OS that formed a LAN, can route and bridge, manage user accounts, load sharable applications, serve files and handle storage vs. a specific router or switch&#39;s platform operating system. </p>
