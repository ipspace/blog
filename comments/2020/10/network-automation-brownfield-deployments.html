<p>They would fall into your 2nd bullet. Though they provide it as a service as well. </p>

<p>You might want to take a look at it. </p>

<p>Cheers,
Bart</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hello Ivan</p>

<p>First of all I would like to say that I am a member of the neops.io core team.</p>

<p>The platform is being developed in partnership with multiple customers and we are about to release version 1.0 really soon. A draft of the documentation can be found at docs.neops.io. 
Hopefully we will soon have filled the many black spots in the documentation and can link to it on the website.</p>

<p>Related to your blog post, I would like to say something about your last two points and the sceptical words:
As a network engineer who has taken the road and moved towards software developers, I would like to quote a German proverb: &quot;No master has yet fallen from heaven&quot;</p>

<p>What I mean to say is that the road to acquire new skills and a new way of thinking can be hard. So why not combine points 2 and 3 and make this path easier? Because in my opinion not only the technology but also the people have to be guided into the new world.</p>

<p>This point, and the fact that each network is a unique snowflake (the logic is implemented by the network engineer, because he knows the network and its requirements best), is what we have brought together in neops.io.</p>

<p>If you are interested, I would be happy to show you neops.io and get your feedback.</p>

<p>Greetings Simon</p>
