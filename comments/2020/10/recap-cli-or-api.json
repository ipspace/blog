Quickly look at show commands. A developer can easily introduce new temporary show-commands. Or enhance existing commands. Or create new hidden commands. Easy tools while developing new code. If she/he had to do that via a GUI or some API, it would be harder to implement. And clumsy to use for quick testing and troubleshooting. So IMHO there will always be a CLI.</p>\n\n<p>That doesn&#39;t mean APIs or GUIs are not useful. Or not necessary. Of course they are. But that doesn&#39;t mean the CLI will go away at any time.</p>\n",
