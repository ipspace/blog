The main reason is that their infrastructures don&#39;t use it is that EVPN didn&#39;t exist at that time or wasn&#39;t mature enough when they needed a solution.</p>\n\n<p>Network vendors have started to support EVPN from 2017. All implementations had their usual bugs and missing features as with every new technology implementation. Added to that there were multiple hardware dependencies that were solved over time.</p>\n\n<p>If I&#39;m looking at the two mechanisms you describe, setting up EVPN on hosts with multicast replication, eBGP route servers (for filtering and perhaps flowspec) and combine this with an RFC 4684 implementation would essentially get you the same type of solution.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously I don&#39;t see these environments moving away from their well tested and proven implementation, but I don&#39;t see EVPN inherently being the wrong tool for the job.</p>\n",
