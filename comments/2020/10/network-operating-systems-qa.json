This looks like a great course to provide more insight  to plan for better purpose build type architectures and product selection.  </p>\n\n<p>As an old school guy the title of the course threw me for a second.  Us old school guys early 80s on(well me at least) when hearing the term &quot;network OS&quot; think of  Novell Netware, Banyan vines, MS-Lan Manager, etc. an OS that formed a LAN, can route and bridge, manage user accounts, load sharable applications, serve files and handle storage vs. a specific router or switch&#39;s platform operating system. </p>\n",
