            <div class="comment-content"><p>Making an SD.WAN really secure is a major challenge. The team from the SD-WAN New Hop(e) project did a tremendous job that required a lot of system, network and security knowledge.</p>

<p>This example shows that you can&#39;t even trust FIPS for proper cryptography anymore. The system described recently got new FIPS certification. This shows that the FIPS certification process is broken and FIPS certification is not a trustable indication for meeting basic security requirements anymore. </p>

<p>It also shows that most customers fail to do a proper due diligence before making purchase decisions or have a fairly high risk appetite. This includes companies active in PCI DSS- and HIPAA-regulated environments.</p>
