            <div class="comment-content"><p>A question I keep tasking myself with addressing but never finding the best answer, is how appropriate is it to reform a network environment into a flattened design such as spine-and-leaf, if that reform is with the sole intent and purpose to enable automation? And at what cost to my own skills as a network engineer as I move further and further from the path of needing to understand and appreciate protocols and functionality when &quot;the code simply handles it&quot;.</p>

<p>IaC is the future. It is unavoidable. But the question I constantly contend with is at what cost, and at what point will my skill set as a network engineer/architect become irrelevant at the negotiating table for a new job or a raise request? Particularly when they can relabel our roles by the promise of SD* and map us against the pay scale for developers once their non-complex spine-and-leaf topology goes live with only BGP and thousands of leaf switches merely needing the concept of overlay networking to be maintained in code.</p>

<p>It&#39;s coming, it&#39;s unstoppable, but it&#39;s scary. Alongside conforming with the progression, how do I stop being scared of the implied threat?</p>
