(i.e. interfere with the network) or is it just a can of worm where, besides all the security aspects you highlighted, people will start using them for things they shouldn&#39;t. I mean, it&#39;s different, but it kind of reminds me of all those ALGs that were needed because of NAT, I know NAT is a problem in itself, but the protocols were broken in the first place. People might start fixing or patching things at the wrong level here. For very specific examples like the stocks usecase it might be a valuable ally but I don&#39;t think the global industry needs this. That beeing said, I didn&#39;t read/listen to all the content.</p>\n",
