Knowledge was, is and always will be the key to understanding. (Where knowledge is not always the same as education.)\nThank you, nice article.</p>\n",

It&#39;s really hard to do if you don&#39;t have tools to do it, and I don&#39;t know what those are. Some part of such a design is a regular as possible; the more details that you have to keep track of the much harder it gets to automate, you have to remember everything and you have to understand the consequences of every detail.</p>\n",
