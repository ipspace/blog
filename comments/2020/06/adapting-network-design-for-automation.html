            <div class="comment-content"><p>I think, IMHO, if anyone will get to the stage that &quot;path of needing to understand and appreciate protocols and functionality when &ldquo;the code simply handles it&rdquo;&quot;, in any area of IT, then that person should remove Engineer part of job description.
And during any outage or troubleshooting, all I could say would be: good luck, you gonna need it. Knowledge was, is and always will be the key to understanding. (Where knowledge is not always the same as education.)
Thank you, nice article.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I think designing networks to be automated is critical and very hard. I still don&#39;t know how to describe what that means, though. It&#39;s really hard to do if you don&#39;t have tools to do it, and I don&#39;t know what those are. Some part of such a design is a regular as possible; the more details that you have to keep track of the much harder it gets to automate, you have to remember everything and you have to understand the consequences of every detail.</p>
