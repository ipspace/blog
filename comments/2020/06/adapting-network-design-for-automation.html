            <div class="comment-content"><p>I think, IMHO, if anyone will get to the stage that &quot;path of needing to understand and appreciate protocols and functionality when &ldquo;the code simply handles it&rdquo;&quot;, in any area of IT, then that person should remove Engineer part of job description.
And during any outage or troubleshooting, all I could say would be: good luck, you gonna need it. Knowledge was, is and always will be the key to understanding. (Where knowledge is not always the same as education.)
Thank you, nice article.</p>
