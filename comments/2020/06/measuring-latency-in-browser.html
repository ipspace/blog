            <div class="comment-content"><p>I find it interesting as well that measurements done this way might actually be more accurate. if you want to measure the latency over internet, when you&#39;re not in control of the network, at least in term of usefulness: 
you won&#39;t have the penalty (or on the contrary the articial priority) on ICMP that can be seen in some network to save some cycles on routers (or advertised a better latency than what your network can actually provide). The DPI that could be in place somewhere will have to inspect this data as well.</p>

<p>You&#39;re using the same protocol to measure than the one that carries the data that you actually care about, and that&#39;s a good monitoring practice IMO.</p>
