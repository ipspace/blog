            <div class="comment-content"><p>another gem Ivan - thanks. </p>

<p>I just wanted to add a bit of my personal experience on the OSPFoGRE subject:  </p>

<p>On a certain OS version of a popular router platform (I believe it&#39;s fixed on newer OS versions now but ...still... it&#39;s representative of what can happen on any platform), the following happens:    </p>

<p>If the &#39;encaps&#39; dst IP address of the GRE tunnel is known in BGP then you need to override that with a static route in order for any OSPF packet to enter the tunnel. You don&#39;t need the static route if the OSPF packets are fragmented. </p>

<p>The reason for this exotic working recipe should be (as we never really got a final answer) that:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The OSPF packets are generated by the OSPF process on the central CPU and it cannot do a BGP lookup since it&#39;s a recursive one</p></li>
<li><p>if you induce fragmentation then it all works .... as I guess an OSPF packet that is too big can access an area of the processing or of a chipset that is provided with the ability to do recursive lookups as well as fragmentation.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Cheers/Ciao <br />

            <div class="comment-content"><p>@Andrea: I would suspect the decision to ignore BGP routes when originating OSPF packets probably comes from someone&#39;s attempts to detect and alleviate recursive routing loops (tunnel endpoint being available over the tunnel scenarios). Fragments follow the regular packet forwarding structures.</p>

<p>Obviously it would help if the behavior was documented/explained.</p>
