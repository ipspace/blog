Editing one word in your article doesn&rsquo;t mean rewriting it! That&rsquo;s clueless and inconsiderate and very disrespectful! </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>@Josh: Petr never said &quot;BGP is the answer to all questions&quot;. He always presented his solution as &quot;I had this specific set of requirements and I found out that based on those requirements it was best to use BGP&quot;.</p>

<p>Look around, and you might notice vendor marketers selling customers BGP-based DC fabric with four switches, or another vendor marketer telling everyone to use BGP and two-way redistribution instead of two routing protocols, or an &quot;engineer&quot; promoting IBGP over EBGP because he desperately wanted to use BGP as the underlay IGP, and his chosen platform couldn&#39;t handle two parallel EBGP address families (IPv4 and EVPN).</p>

<p>Occasionally I get sick-and-tired of people claiming &quot;X is the answer&quot; without even understanding what the question was in the first place.</p>
