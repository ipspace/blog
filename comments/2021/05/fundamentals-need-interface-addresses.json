Good example is that recent horrific pandemic.\nBut I agree with you on this: &quot;Speaking of traceroute: it might give you wrong interface information any time you happen to have asymmetrical routing or multiple equal-cost paths.&quot;\nDon&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;ve nothing against unnumbered interfaces. For me they make sense in particular environments. But why shouldn&#39;t there be no drawbacks with unnumbered interfaces?</p>\n",

Everything has drawbacks... or you haven&#39;t looked hard enough. It&#39;s just that I keep getting the same &quot;monitoring and troubleshooting&quot; arguments, even though they weren&#39;t exactly valid for years if not decades.</p>\n",
