         "html": "<p>In their datasheet it&#39;s stated &quot;system throughput (bidirectional)&quot;. That&#39;s because of full duplex. All vendors are calculating switching capacity like this. So for the calculation of the frame size, you have to divide it by two. The calculated ~281 bytes frame size is already pretty small from my point of view. What&#39;s the average frame size in an average environment? Around 500 bytes? With those specs they maybe could cover 99 % of the market. Would love to see an example in real life of exhausting 12.8 Tbps line rate with real life traffic over a reasonable amount of time.</p>\n",
