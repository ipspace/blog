Decreasing this value (instead of the initial RTO) has been reported to hugely improve TCP goodput in presence of incast - because it reduces the dramatical impact of packet losses and retransmissions. See:</p>\n\n<p>https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/incast-sigcomm2009.pdf</p>\n\n<p>This study explores values for RTOmin of 1 ms and lower. Note that, in practice, you can be limited by the kernel clock resolution -- we have found some systems in the past where it prevented you from setting any value lower than 5 ms. In any case, the benefit from the default RTOmin = 200 ms is huge. </p>\n",

Clients are 1G, servers are 10G/25G. Most of access switches can not suport all those servers bursts neither. Is still better drop than use pause frames on access switches? </p>\n",

I love how much I learn from the comments ;)) Will fix the text and add a link.</p>\n\n<p>@Xavier: As most traffic toward the client is client-generated in the first place, you wouldn&#39;t expect to see a massive incast problem, and as the TCP bursts gradually increase in size as the peers are trying to figure out what works, eventually the network-to-client link will get into packet drop territory and the inbound TCP sessions will reach an equilibrium.</p>\n\n<p>I would strongly suggest you figure out (A) how much buffering there is on your access switches and (B) what&#39;s the percentage of outbound packet drops caused by output queue overflow. You might not have that problem at all.</p>\n",
