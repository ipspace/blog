Decreasing this value (instead of the initial RTO) has been reported to hugely improve TCP goodput in presence of incast - because it reduces the dramatical impact of packet losses and retransmissions. See:</p>\n\n<p>https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/incast-sigcomm2009.pdf</p>\n\n<p>This study explores values for RTOmin of 1 ms and lower. Note that, in practice, you can be limited by the kernel clock resolution -- we have found some systems in the past where it prevented you from setting any value lower than 5 ms. In any case, the benefit from the default RTOmin = 200 ms is huge. </p>\n",
