I&#39;ve no PhD in this area but it looks like consistent hashing is much more advanced and is still an active area of research (see https://medium.com/@dgryski/consistent-hashing-algorithmic-tradeoffs-ef6b8e2fcae8). My very simplified understanding is that resilient hashing is a similar idea but due to a small number of buckets and limited TCAM space cannot satisfy all of the properties of a consistent hashing algorithm. </p>\n\n<p>&gt; Is there an easy-to-deploy software solution out there that would allow you to build large-scale anycast TCP services\nIf we assume that &quot;large-scale&quot; and &quot;easy&quot; are not mutually exclusive, I believe there is. Due to how networking is implemented inside Kubernetes, you always get two layers of load-balancers (similar to cloud-scalers) with the first layer doing some form of consistent hashing and second layer doing the standard L7 LB (ingress). One prime example is Cilium https://cilium.io/blog/2020/11/10/cilium-19#maglev and although I don&#39;t have the exact numbers, I believe they test their releases against some pretty large number of nodes.</p>\n",
