They realized some years ago that scaling those designs to next gen wired or wireless bandwidths would lead to a stupid level of CapEx.  So the intent was to run those appliances as software in regular arrays of commodity servers, the same as had been done for applications in VMs and containers.</p>\n\n<p>There isn&#39;t a good name for the set of things which used to run in dedicated boxes sold for 10x the cost of parts.  So I&#39;ll allow &quot;Network Function&quot;, which is not intuitive to me either, as that name.</p>\n",
