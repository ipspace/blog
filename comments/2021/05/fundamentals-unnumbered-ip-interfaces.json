Can you please say more about the &quot;loopback interface hack&quot; you mentioned in this post (and also in <a href=\"https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/05/fundamentals-interface-node-addresses/\">Back to Basics: The History of IP Interface Addresses</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/05/routing-unnumbered-interfaces/\">Packet Forwarding and Routing over Unnumbered Interfaces</a>)?</p>\n\n<p>I may be totally off the mark here, but is the &quot;loopback interface hack&quot; about repurposing an address from the 127.0.0.0/8 space as a routable address for a point-to-point link, and modifying the corresponding routing table entries to route traffic to such address(es) differently?</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s an illustration of what I mean: https://excalidraw.com/#json=9GRLGN0jn6N6kqMtFL0Aq,KX21Aet2Luct85DDPbhPPw</p>\n",
