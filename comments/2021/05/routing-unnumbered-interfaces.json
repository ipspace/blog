You don&#39;t need the static route if the OSPF packets are fragmented. </p>\n\n<p>The reason for this exotic working recipe should be (as we never really got a final answer) that:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The OSPF packets are generated by the OSPF process on the central CPU and it cannot do a BGP lookup since it&#39;s a recursive one</p></li>\n<li><p>if you induce fragmentation then it all works .... as I guess an OSPF packet that is too big can access an area of the processing or of a chipset that is provided with the ability to do recursive lookups as well as fragmentation.  </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Cheers/Ciao <br />\nAndrea  </p>\n",
