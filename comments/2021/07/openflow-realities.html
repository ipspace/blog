            <div class="comment-content"><p>OpenFlow was based on the assumption that switches/routers are sealed appliances: hardware and software can&#39;t/won&#39;t be disaggregated, you can&#39;t write your own NOS (with less than $50M funding), you can&#39;t customize existing NOSes, etc. That painted them into a corner where the only solution was a centralized external control plane. Disaggregation was announced just a few years later.</p>

<p>Maybe the lesson to be learned here is to question assumptions thoroughly when they lead you to a bad place.</p>

<p>Unfortunately someone took @ipspace handle a year before I registered ipspace.net, and it doesn&#39;t make sense to switch to anything else, so whatever. Looks like I&#39;ll have to keep dealing with people who prefer <em>ad hominem</em> attacks to technical arguments.</p>
