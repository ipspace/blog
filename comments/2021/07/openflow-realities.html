            <div class="comment-content"><p>OpenFlow was based on the assumption that switches/routers are sealed appliances: hardware and software can&#39;t/won&#39;t be disaggregated, you can&#39;t write your own NOS (with less than $50M funding), you can&#39;t customize existing NOSes, etc. That painted them into a corner where the only solution was a centralized external control plane. Disaggregation was announced just a few years later.</p>

<p>Maybe the lesson to be learned here is to question assumptions thoroughly when they lead you to a bad place.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Wes. It should be noted that the author&#39;s Twitter handle is https://twitter.com/ioshints. The copyrighted name of the incumbent vendor&#39;s NOS is right there in the handle. Openflow or disaggretation are not in the interest of the author</p>
