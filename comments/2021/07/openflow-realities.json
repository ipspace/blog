         "html": "<p>OpenFlow was based on the assumption that switches/routers are sealed appliances: hardware and software can&#39;t/won&#39;t be disaggregated, you can&#39;t write your own NOS (with less than $50M funding), you can&#39;t customize existing NOSes, etc. That painted them into a corner where the only solution was a centralized external control plane. Disaggregation was announced just a few years later.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe the lesson to be learned here is to question assumptions thoroughly when they lead you to a bad place.</p>\n",
