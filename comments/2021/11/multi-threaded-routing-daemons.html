            <div class="comment-content"><p>Junos used to spawn a dedicated thread only if the precision-timers knob (sub-15ms hold time) was applied, now I think it is baked in by default.  Design sanity is good but I think it&#39;s still a trivial job to choke keepalives..on any vendor platform not properly protected.  If there occurs a mega-failure someday it will probably be related to this.  Even the processes meant to protect systems (policers) can also smother it.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Ivan - all modern routing protocols implementations are multi-threaded, with a minimum separation of adj handeling, route calculations and update generation. Note - writing multi-threaded code for complex tasks is a non trivial exercise (you could search for thread safety and similar artifacts and what happens when not implemented correctly). Moving to a multi-threaded code in early 2010s resulted in a multi-release (year) effort and 100s of related bugs all around.
FYI non preemptive is usually called &ldquo;run to completion&rdquo;</p>
