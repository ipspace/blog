            <div class="comment-content"><p>Probably, it would be beneficial mentioning the RIPE Database. The recent RDAP protocol, the RPL for expressing routing policies.
I remember back in the 90s using RIPE routing information for generating proper BGP configurations. 
Every ISP could use those...
The solution is well known, just lot of people ignore it, since it requires some resources and has some costs. It is easier to sell a really best effort service. 
The final decision is at the customer hand. Are you happy with a best effort, not reliable service or do you pay for better quality?
A single Internet cannot fulfill all the diverse requirements...</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>It is as you said Ivan. Complexity has gotten way out of hand these days that breakage can happen more often, or more catastrophically, or both. BGP for ex has become a swiss-army knife used to solve all problems under the sun, resulting in a very large code base, and large code base means more instability and more chance for bugs. So is DNS, so is everything really. Putting things to the Cloud doesn&#39;t simplify it either, as anyone who has experience with Office 365 can attest; random problems keep coming up all the time. </p>

<p>A big cause of the problem, just as Randy Bush, one of the true wisemen of Networking pointed out -- TFS that one, I haven&#39;t read that short masterpiece of his -- is that the IVTF, the main body of Internet Standards, is a vested-interest group made up of vendor representatives whose goals are to sell ever more equipment, not to build a highly scalable structure. Having all the deciding power in the hand of one group is super dangerous, as history has shown, and having it in the hand of a group whose agenda is misaligned with that of users/operators, even more so. </p>

<p>Look at some of what they have given us over the years: they didn&#39;t include the session protocol, gave us an addressing scheme missing half the structure, then claimed an address-exhaustion problem which was the direct result of this, and tried to impose a pathetic solution which was IPv6, which itself brings a lot of problems, because it was a workaround to a structural defect. Had they focused on fixing the structural issue, it would have resulted in a lot less complexity and address exhaustion would be a non-issue. But hey, doing that wouldn&#39;t result in more box sell, would it? Ipv6 is one of the biggest lies, and a result of dictatorship when one group of special interest having too much power, tries to impose decisions on people against their will. It solves nothing, and worsens a lot of things. A very pressing issue is the Internet routing table explosion, and with things like Multihoming and the use of Anycast -- which is not a type of adddress, but due to its topology-independent characteristic, a kind of name and a special case of Multicast -- this keeps getting worse. Ipv6 solves none of this, yet it&#39;s being forced down our throats because TINA. </p>

<p>LISP is also a big joke, a clear case of misunderstanding the fundamentals, and an atrocious example of RFC 1925 rule 6. That&#39;s why the whole thing is unscalable and it&#39;s been going nowhere for 15 yrs. If this crap is forced on us the same way IPv6 is, what we can expect are complexity explosion and degraded performance. Have a quick look at what early adopters had to say about LISP:</p>

<p>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224178013_Routing_Scalability_An_Operator&#39;s_View</p>

<p>If they did things right with DNS and addressing, there&#39;s no need for many of the kludges, including EVPN, VXLAN, and IP Anycast, at all. DNS can take care of what Anycast is doing, and in fact Akamai is not using Anycast but hierarchical DNS. In a word, Anycast is solved on the Application layer, not the Network layer. Ethernet can also be thrown away, as its functionality is already taken care of by IP and so we can remove one redundant layer. The network will be much simplified, there will be less circular dependency, less failure, more stability. But hey, we need to keep the Standard Groups going, so more compexity pls. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why when this kind of structurally-unsound architecture which is the Internet, keeps getting bigger and bigger, the effect of the faults will be amplified aka sensive depdendence on initial conditions, and we see more large-scale breakdowns. </p>

<p>DNSSEC, from Geoff Huston&#39;s description, looks to be in a pretty bad spot thanks to security fear mongering leading to the use of excessively long crypto key. Looks how much complexity it adds on top of the protocol, which otherwise is structurally sound, because some security idiots worry about some hypothetical scenarios that happen once in a bluemoon. But the last part of his article is what made me laugh. What? Fear of Quantum Computing breaking Crypto? Sorry to burst the bubble, but until Quantum Error Correction is feasible -- big hint: it gets exponentially harder with the number of Qubits, and they can&#39;t do it for any small number of Qubit now because QM is not an understood theory -- there&#39;ll be no QC except for the toys put out now and then as a grant-winning trick for Physics schools. </p>

<p>Worry about fixing the real thing first, before worrying about the invasion of science-fiction types of gadget. This lack of basic knowledge drives the fear-mongering, misleads the uninitiated (in this case the typical IT professionals who generally lack engineering and scientific knowledge) who misplace their trusts in authorities, and generates a lot of unneeded complexity, benefiting almost no one but the vendors who always have more boxes to sell or more services to offer. </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I think it&#39;s worth mentioning the continued centralization of services on the internet.  Outages of smaller, distributed and non-inter-dependent services tend to go unnoticed.  When so many websites have all of their dependencies located in AWS/Facebook/Google/other, everyone everywhere notices when the lights go out for a few hours.  As you said in this very article, why would you run your own e-mail service these days (unless you are an e-mail SME)?  The answer is that we trade complexity for convenience.  Yes, you can get your service to market faster than ever, but you are at the mercy of your dependencies when things go awry.</p>
