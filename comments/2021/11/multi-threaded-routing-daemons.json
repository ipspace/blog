Design sanity is good but I think it&#39;s still a trivial job to choke keepalives..on any vendor platform not properly protected.  If there occurs a mega-failure someday it will probably be related to this.  Even the processes meant to protect systems (policers) can also smother it.</p>\n",

Note - writing multi-threaded code for complex tasks is a non trivial exercise (you could search for thread safety and similar artifacts and what happens when not implemented correctly). Moving to a multi-threaded code in early 2010s resulted in a multi-release (year) effort and 100s of related bugs all around.\nFYI non preemptive is usually called &ldquo;run to completion&rdquo;</p>\n",
