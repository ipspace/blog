We tried not offering certain (legacy) services to our internal customers, which made a lot of sense from financial, architecture and design point of view, as in the past these &quot;snowflake&quot; services put a massive burden on the infra team. </p>\n\n<p>But in the end the business always wins, no matter how great your pitch is to the C-people. The business has to run. So we built a snowflake again :(</p>\n",

There are always indirect ways nudging customers off legacy infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p>After all, if you were still on a frame relay connection, what cost and speed benefit would the customer have these days? Practically none. But I understand cloud providers need a common denominator to deliver services in a more unified fashion. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also another reason why they only allow you to have a couple hundred routes to manage. They do not and cannot allow for past sloppy practices to be reintroduced into their cloud.</p>\n",
