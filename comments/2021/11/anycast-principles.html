            <div class="comment-content"><p>MPLS-T is more like classical ATM permanent VC.
MPLS LDP is more like soft PVC in ATM.
MPLS with RSVP/TE is more like PNNI in ATM.
The control planes are very similar and somewhat re-invented only. The big difference is the dropping of SAR, since at gigabit seeds it does not have enough advantage on managing the jitter, like it is absolutely beneficial at kilobit speeds. </p>

<p>For me packet switching and VC are not contradictory. The term &quot;virtual&quot; denotes the usage of packet switching for simulating a TDM-style circuit behavior from the upper layers perspective. 
How on earth could you do VC without an underlying packet switching?
In that sense ATM is also packet switching, just the packets are called &quot;cells&quot;.</p>

<p>GMPLS can control classical physical, non-virtual circuits. Pure MPLS would not in the stricter term, if we do not limit it to the control plane, but we take it together with its data plane specifications.</p>

<p>Centralized SDN is also nothing new. Just the reincarnation of telephone switch management through the DCN. Plus using IP instead of X.25/OSI and some trendier fashionable protocols instead of the old ITU-T X.stuff. But the basic architecture is very similar.
There are a lot of small networks where centralized SDN would not have a big problem. For example, the whole Hungarian telco network. Of course, this would be different in China... :-)</p>

<p>Anycast might be limited by routing policies. It is easy in a private network. On the public Internet, you should not originate other addresses than what you really own. Otherwise, the other ISPs might filter your advertisements as security issues. This could be also be a problem in a multi-AS, multi-provider MPLS network that might limit the anycast scoping to special peering agreements. 
You have a similar problem with mobile hosts or networks. It would not work by default in the public Internet. </p>

            <div class="comment-content">Bela is very much spot-on : )). Let me qualify some of my statements, to make them clearer. When I said &quot;MPLS is more general than both VC and packet-switch, because it&rsquo;s Transport, and this point is crucial. MPLS can therefore be generalized to support non-packet-switch network, in VC style or what not&quot;, indeed GMPLS is what I had in mind. By &quot;VC style&quot;, I actually meant traditional TDM style, not VC. GMPLS supports both packet and non-packet switching.<br />

<p>Why is this important? Because with higher and higher interface speeds, per-packet processing at some point (if not already), proves too costly, and a switch to TDM or wavelength switching in the high-speed transport network is very desirable. In non-packet transport network, usually there&#39;s no label stack, so things like TE&#39;s facility bypass won&#39;t work. AFAIK, SRGB won&#39;t work either, esp. at boundary routers that do different styles of switching on different interfaces. </p>

<p>I strongly believe one of the reasons proponents uses to push SR is traffic engineering. But SR TE, if done using central controller, won&#39;t scale. Just an example: in photonic network, right now due to technological limitation, optical cross-connect can&#39;t do wavelength conversion, so much larger amount of TE info -- info on individual lambdas on every single link -- will have to be exchanged between TE routers, and more complex path computation will need to be applied. And signal attenuation and optical impairments due to effects of nonlinear optics such as stimulated Raman scattering or two-/four-wave mixing etc, also needs to be accounted for by path computation as well. Centralization won&#39;t scale. </p>

<p>Bela was right above when he said &quot;There are a lot of small networks where centralized SDN would not have a big problem.&quot; Yes, centralization works fine for small scale, and fails spectacularly at large scale or as you start adding more features/info. So I can&#39;t see how SR is any better than existing TE, as the problem of TE is not something a label distribution method can resolve. </p>

<p>PNNI is a way to do QoS routing from the source, and it&#39;s a failure with scalability problem. Back then, route caching was proposed to solve scalability problem with PNNI, but route caching can lead to cache thrashing. Anything based on similar concept will fail at scale. Hierarchical destination-based, distributed routing is the only way to scale to very large size, because it distributes the states across the nodes, reducing both the computation burden at the endpoints and state explosion in the core. </p>

<p>As for LDP vs SR, since LDP is a minimalist protocol, I don&#39;t see much trouble. Protocol (and all software) should be kept simple as possible, and trying to stuff as much as one can into one (think BGP with 100k lines of code) is a bad idea. SR brings with itself much complexity, so I fail to see a tangible benefit. The ultimate reality check would be: have we got any large-scale outage caused by LDP? If not, LDP passes the simplicity-stability test.  </p>

<p>Re Anycast being name, let me clarify. Address identifies where you are, whereas names identifies what/who you are. Address therefore, is location independent, and name, location-independent. So anycast address, by necessity, is a name. Anycast is but a name set with a rule to return one member of the set ( basically a special case of multicast ). The reason anycast and multicast are considered address is because the OSI model&#39;s addressing scheme is missing more than half its structure. If anycast is done right, it should be implemented at the application layer (Akamai got this right, though Idk if I get the fundamentals or just by sheer luck), and we won&#39;t have all of the issues Bela mentioned above (and the address exhaustion issue, and the RIB explosion issue etc). Port channel, by its nature, is also a form of anycast.</p>
