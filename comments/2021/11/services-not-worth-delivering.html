            <div class="comment-content"><p>This works great if you are a SaaS and have a selection of customers. For any internal IT organisation, the world is a lot more complex. We tried not offering certain (legacy) services to our internal customers, which made a lot of sense from financial, architecture and design point of view, as in the past these &quot;snowflake&quot; services put a massive burden on the infra team. </p>

<p>But in the end the business always wins, no matter how great your pitch is to the C-people. The business has to run. So we built a snowflake again :(</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Pushing the risk acceptance up the stack sometimes works - document what risks (and increased costs) you&#39;ll be exposed to due to the snowflake service and get a C-level person to sign off on that. </p>

<p>Until you get the sign off, you cannot proceed ;)</p>

<p>Alternatively, I was told that compliance (or risk management) team could be of great help if you could properly present the risk of deploying snowflake services to them.</p>
