            <div class="comment-content">I think some of the following statements from the referenced blog post are wrong:<br />

<p>&gt; In the case of unequal-cost multipathing (also called &ldquo;unequal-cost load balancing&rdquo; by some technologies, such as EIGRP), you will have two paths.
&gt; Path 1 might have a lower metric, so internally it&rsquo;ll be given hashes 0 and 1.
&gt; Path 2 might have a higher metric, so internally it&rsquo;ll be given hashes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.</p>

<p>Paths with lower metric are usually more preferred. So really it should be the opposite, shouldn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Assuming a metric (cost) ratio of 1:3, path 1 will be associated with hashes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 whereas path 2 will be linked to hashes 6 and 7.</p>
