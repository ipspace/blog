Or implement multiple RRs (in a symmetrical way) and having BGP Multipath configured on &quot;A&quot;. With that you would also benefit from redundancy.</p>\n\n<p>I read that you&#39;ll bring BGP ADD-PATH (RFC 7911) into the mix. So you could have something along BGP PIC Edge with subsecond convergence :D Looking forward to...</p>\n",
