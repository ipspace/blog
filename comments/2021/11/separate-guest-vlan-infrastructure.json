               "html": "<p>Thanks a million for this gem. When I think I&#39;ve seen everything, someone sends me another vendor stupidity that makes my day (in some sense).</p>\n\n<p>However, this is not VLAN hopping, at least not the &quot;original&quot; data-plane SNAFU. This is unprotected control plane due to vendor stupidity. Cisco has (had?) a similar problem with VTP:</p>\n\n<p>https://designclinic.ipspace.net/topic/network-device-hardening/</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if I understood it correctly, this particular stupidity requires access to a physical switch port, not guest VLAN access. If someone can access a &quot;core&quot; (intra-network) port you have bigger problems than VLAN hopping ;)</p>\n",

         "html": "Here is a recent VLAN hopping exploit for you: Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise AP-Mode on AOS6<br />\n\n<p>This feature is related to authentication (802.1X or MAC) and VLAN assignment on a port where an wireless AP is discovered.\nAP is discovered using &quot;lldp.tlv.enable_system_cap.wlan_access_pt == 1&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>The switch assume the AP is in a NON-tunnel mode and that he will proceed authentication and tag traffic into the proper VLAN himself.\nThe idea is to avoid several authentication at AP and switch and speedup the process.</p>\n\n<p>So the switch is not authenticating devices seen on the AP port. =&gt; authentication bypass\nSwitch is also trusting all the VLAN tags coming from this port. =&gt; VLAN hopping</p>\n\n<p>This features is enabled by default. You can still disable it.\nWhen upgrading from a previous version that doesn&#39;t support it, the configuration is converted to enable it.</p>\n\n<p>I discovered it at a customer&#39;s place because they connected an AP to a unmanaged switch with an uplink to the ALE AOS6 switch.\nPC connected to the unmanaged switch were not getting DHCP or network access.</p>\n\n<p>I connected my PC, did a wireshark and saw 802.1q trafic.\nI configured an 802.1q interface and got access to all VLAN on the switch.</p>\n\n<p>I was able to exploit it at several customers by forging LLDP to look like an AP.</p>\n\n<p>I was not able to exploit it on AOS8.\nWhile AP-mode is also enabled by default, it doesn&#39;t work the same way as in AOS6.</p>\n\n<p>ALE doesn&#39;t consider it a security issue and won&#39;t change the default behavior of AOS6 as it&#39;s becoming end of life. Unfortunately, it&#39;s still used on a lot of switches.</p>\n",
