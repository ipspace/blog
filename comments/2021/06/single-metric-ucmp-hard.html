            <div class="comment-content"><p>Ivan, I still don&#39;t understand this part here: &quot; S1 would see 10.42.0.1/32 prefix being available through L1 with exactly the same cost as through L2.&quot;</p>

<p>Say, L1 and L2 both advertise 10.42.0.1/32 to S1. Wouldn&#39;t S1 get 4 OSPF entries of 10.42.0.1/32 with different metrics then? And so it would load-balance among the 4 entries accordingly. Why would S1 see 10.42.0.1/32 thru L1 with the same cost as thru L2, unless each of them only generates one 10.42.0.1/32 toward S1?</p>
