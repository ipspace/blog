            <div class="comment-content"><p>Dear Anonymous,</p>

<p>The &quot;medium p2p&quot; interface configuration command is used on NX-OS. I didn&#39;t have to use it on Cisco IOS XE... as you would have discovered by looking at the device configurations (there&#39;s a reason I added a link to them at the end of the blog post).</p>

<p>As for &quot;how would the printouts look like&quot; - I don&#39;t have them handy, and I don&#39;t have time to collect them, but here&#39;s what you can do: set up a lab, and do the tests yourself. Nexus 9300v is downloadable as a Vagrant box, and you can use my topology file with <strong>netsim-tools</strong>, changing the default device type from <strong>csr</strong> to <strong>nxos</strong>.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the documentation to get you started https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</p>

<p>Once you get those printouts, do get in touch and I&#39;ll add them to the blog post.</p>

<p>Thank you! Ivan</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hi, </p>

<p>Really good to see your article on this. We have been using this in production for about 2 years now on the Cisco 4500x platform in vss.</p>

<p>The upside to all this is that migrating clients from a shared vlan to dedicated vlans and nothing from the client end routing or subletting had to change. </p>

<p>Of course we only use static routing here. The clients can not accidentally start arping for another client ip or take over the default gateway arp accidentally or intentionally and affect other clients.</p>

<p>The other plus is that we can apply per vlan policers in and out per client by vlan and not by IP. </p>
