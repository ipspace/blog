Or am I doing something wrong? Apologies for the lengthy comment, really looking forward to read your thoughts on this :) Also, to confirm the traffic is in fact taking the interfaces mentioned in CEF, I applied ACLs to see the traffic matches, so it&#39;s definitely taking the interfaces as seen in CEF.</p>\n",
