Any situation where an order of operations causes different results is something that needs to be fixed.  There is no need for speculation.  BGP already knows the admin distance of the route that won and can easily do a comparison to see if it would win and if so send it&#39;s route down to the RIB.  This would solve the problem.</p>\n",
