Any situation where an order of operations causes different results is something that needs to be fixed.  There is no need for speculation.  BGP already knows the admin distance of the route that won and can easily do a comparison to see if it would win and if so send it&#39;s route down to the RIB.  This would solve the problem.</p>\n",

         "html": "The question is: Does the affected subnet belong to the company or not? It&#39;s either one or the other (or you would have a problem). Then based on whether it&#39;s internal or external to the company you would choose the right routing protocol. The numbers of administrative distance for the various routing protocols are there for a reason. They are based on reliability and trustworthiness of the routing protocol. I see no need for complicated redistribution on multiple points. So definitely rethink your design.<br />\n\n\n",
