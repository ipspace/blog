            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hello Ivan - thanks for giving visibility to this topic. </p>

<p>BGP-LS is great but must be used in the correct context. BGP-LS creates an abstracted view of the IGP but doesn&#39;t provide you with the nitty gritty of the IGP, plus it&#39;s not as real time as the IGP can be. So, BGP-LS is great for converting topology information but in use-cases
where not all of the details need to emerge; So, for example an SDN application that
doesn&rsquo;t have real-time needs. BGP-LS can be good enough too in scenarios where there is no other way of conveying the IGP topology - for example an inter-AS scenario. </p>

<p>So, in my opinion, in a true Route Analytics scenario, IGP is indeed still needed. BGP-LS might be good enough for non-real-time SDN applications. </p>

<p>Regarding the  security aspects that you rightly pointing out, well, as always, there are things you can do to mitigate the risk. Having on the management box a per-ospf-process OSPFoGRE Adjacency is one of them and some other kludges such as that of poisoning interface costs on the anchor routers to avoid the management box to be traversed in case of multiple network failures is another one, not to mention that you can manage who can configure what on the management box and so forth. </p>

<p>Cheers/Ciao</p>
