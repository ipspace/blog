If you use OSPF and BGP, you need to learn both of them and be sufficiently savvy with them. Using a different tool for every problem may be the first step to create a huge mess. If OSPF is only marginally better than BGP for your problem, BGP should be the solution.</p>\n",

Every other implementation is too overloaded with nerd knobs.</p>\n\n<p>Also, <em>using the best tool for the job</em> doesn&#39;t mean <em>create a NASCAR slide of tools you use just to boost your CV</em> ;)... and yet again, craftmasters intuitively get that, it&#39;s only in networking (or maybe in IT in general) that we have to argue about common sense.</p>\n",
