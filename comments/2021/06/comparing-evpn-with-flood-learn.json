Thus many vendors use the term <em>ARP suppression</em> when ARP broadcasts are not only <em>answered</em> by an edge switch (the first hop router, usually the ToR), but the request is <em>suppressed</em> instead of flooded.</p>\n\n<p>[Yes, this does interfere with devices expecting to glean information from ARP packets which usually go everywhere in the layer 2 domain.]</p>\n",
