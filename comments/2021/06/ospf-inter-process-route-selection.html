            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Ivan, I notice at last the route from OSPF process 1 always overwrites the one from process 3 when costs are equal. This behaviour is in line with Andrea&#39;s finding, Cisco OSPF implementation uses process ID to break ties. Routes with a lower process number win. </p>

<p>So the part where you wrote &quot;This is definitely weird. The new entry replaced the old one&quot;, and, &quot;The debugging printout claims the second route has closer admin distance, but the admin distances are definitely the same. So maybe it&rsquo;s the process number, or the sequence of route insertion that matters.&quot; In this part, route from process 3 takes over route from process 1, so looks like behaviour contradicts the previous part. </p>

<p>But the debug msg in this part also prints the same msg &quot;closer admin distance&quot;, so I suspect that&#39;s because the commands</p>

<p>rtr(config)#int gig 2
rtr(config-if)#ip ospf cost 1000</p>

<p>is still active in gig 2 at that time, making route from process 1 more expensive (metric 1000 vs 2), hence get overwritten by route from process 3 despite the higher process no of the latter. So when you later change cost of gig 3 to 2000, gig 2 route from process 1 wins again. And that&#39;d explain in the end, when the routes from the 2 processes have the same default costs, route from process 1 always wins. </p>

<p>So the metric at gig 2 being left at 1000 must be the reason for the seemingly inconsistent behaviour, I think.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Yes, something related to the OSPF process seems to be a tie breaker. Is it the OSPF process ID, or the routing process ID (the thing you get with <strong>show ip protocol summary</strong>)? Who knows. </p>

<p>Until someone provides a pointer to a bit of well-written documentation (not a blog post or a forum reply), I&#39;d wouldn&#39;t even try to use this &quot;feature&quot; in a network design.</p>
