            <div class="comment-content"><p>There is always a limit to every maxim. If you only use BGP, you only need to know BGP well. If you use OSPF and BGP, you need to learn both of them and be sufficiently savvy with them. Using a different tool for every problem may be the first step to create a huge mess. If OSPF is only marginally better than BGP for your problem, BGP should be the solution.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>@Vincent: I should set up a &quot;<em>just say in data center</em>&quot; Twitter account along the lines of https://twitter.com/justsaysinmice and use it every time someone says &quot;<em>you should use only BGP for your routing</em>&quot;.</p>

<p>On a more serious note, while I agree with you in principle, the only time I&#39;d recommend someone to use BGP only <em>in data center</em> would be if they&#39;re using Cumulus Linux. Every other implementation is too overloaded with nerd knobs.</p>

<p>Also, <em>using the best tool for the job</em> doesn&#39;t mean <em>create a NASCAR slide of tools you use just to boost your CV</em> ;)... and yet again, craftmasters intuitively get that, it&#39;s only in networking (or maybe in IT in general) that we have to argue about common sense.</p>
