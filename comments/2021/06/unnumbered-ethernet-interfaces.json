I didn&#39;t have to use it on Cisco IOS XE... as you would have discovered by looking at the device configurations (there&#39;s a reason I added a link to them at the end of the blog post).</p>\n\n<p>As for &quot;how would the printouts look like&quot; - I don&#39;t have them handy, and I don&#39;t have time to collect them, but here&#39;s what you can do: set up a lab, and do the tests yourself. Nexus 9300v is downloadable as a Vagrant box, and you can use my topology file with <strong>netsim-tools</strong>, changing the default device type from <strong>csr</strong> to <strong>nxos</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the documentation to get you started https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</p>\n\n<p>Once you get those printouts, do get in touch and I&#39;ll add them to the blog post.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you! Ivan</p>\n",
