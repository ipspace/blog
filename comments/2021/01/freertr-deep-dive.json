At first I started labbing with c2600 hardware.. then moved to dymamips, then iou, then the various iOSv xr and xe images and now freertr. Although I have not tried frr yet, I think I will have to give both freertr and frr some more attention. </p>\n\n<p>I wonder if anyone else besides the author of this software has or will run freertr on production and see if the results of dpdk hold out.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for this gem!</p>\n",
