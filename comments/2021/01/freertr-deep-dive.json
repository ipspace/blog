         "html": "<p>Wow, what a diamond in the ruff! This is an excellent piece of software. Finally one image for all the protocols you&#39;ll ever need, and with a low memory footprint to boot. At first I started labbing with c2600 hardware.. then moved to dymamips, then iou, then the various iOSv xr and xe images and now freertr. Although I have not tried frr yet, I think I will have to give both freertr and frr some more attention. </p>\n\n<p>I wonder if anyone else besides the author of this software has or will run freertr on production and see if the results of dpdk hold out.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for this gem!</p>\n",

And you are right, freeRtr is a masterpiece that combined with dpdk provide me a tremendous 6x1GE router. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m using (sadly because of COVID-19) everyday, and it is rock solid. Having BGP v4/v6, Gretap for WIFI NAC, cherry on the cake UPNP forwarding !</p>\n\n<p>As a side notes, GEANT RARE project aims propose a routing platform that can fit R&amp;E use case. (nx100 MPLS LSR for example, or BNG) More information can be found <a href=\"https://wiki.geant.org/display/RARE/\">here</a> and a gentle introduction to the RARE project <a href=\"https://p4.org/p4/geant-rare.html\">here</a></p>\n\n<p>We are also trying to write a comprehensive documentation <a href=\"https://docs.freertr.net/\">here</a></p>\n",
