            <div class="comment-content"><p>Wow, what a diamond in the ruff! This is an excellent piece of software. Finally one image for all the protocols you&#39;ll ever need, and with a low memory footprint to boot. At first I started labbing with c2600 hardware.. then moved to dymamips, then iou, then the various iOSv xr and xe images and now freertr. Although I have not tried frr yet, I think I will have to give both freertr and frr some more attention. </p>

<p>I wonder if anyone else besides the author of this software has or will run freertr on production and see if the results of dpdk hold out.</p>

<p>Thank you for this gem!</p>
