         "html": "<p>&gt; <em>RPKI cannot be used to validate the path between your network and the origin. The bad guys can still spoof the AS path.</em>\n&gt; <em>Can we stop the bad guys doing that? Yes, but not with RPKI.</em></p>\n\n<p>This is true, but not the full story.  While you can&#39;t <em>stop</em> the bad guys with RPKI, RPKI can often limit the <em>reach</em> of the bad guys.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say that I am announcing 2001:db8:1200::/40 in Sweden, and have RPKI saying that it can only be announced by AS 65001, and /40 is the longest prefix length allowed for that prefix.  A hijacker can then not use more specific announcments (e.g. 2001:db8:1200::/41) to win over my legitimate announcement.  Instead they need to announce the exact same prefix I do, but with a shorter AS path.  And getting a shorter AS path can actually be difficult.</p>\n\n<p>To get the announcement out, the hijacker needs to be a customer of some transit provider, and have an AS number of their own, e.g. 65002.  The transit provider will not accept an announcment from them with an AS path consisting of <em>only</em> AS 65001; they need to send the AS path &quot;65002&nbsp;65001&quot;, which immediately gives them a disadvantage, since <em>my</em>, legitimate, announcment consists of only AS 65001.  If I and the hijacker use the same transit provider, they lose immediately.</p>\n\n<p>If the hijacker is further away, e.g. located in America, then there is a good chance that they can trick others in America to use their announcment.  But over here in Europe, there is reasonable chance that their announcment will lose against mine, since theirs is likely to have passed through more ASes than mine, <em>and</em> they have that one AS disadvantage to start with.  And within Sweden, they are even less likely to win.</p>\n\n<p>So RPKI can help a little bit, making life slightly more difficult for hijackers, but it is certainly not a panacea.  You should absolutely not <em>trust</em> it to protect you against hostile hijacks.</p>\n",
