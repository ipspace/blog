            <div class="comment-content"><p>I&#39;m aware of only 2 Cisco IOS-XR customers who asked for (and used partially) UCMP for ISIS during the last 10 years. Implementation was done on CRS and ASR9k.
The first one did want to implement bundle/link aggregation (even for ECMP) and had different link speeds between 2 routers. He used UCMP instead of mixed speed bundles.
The second one had almost the same use case for overseas interconnection with continent across long-distance/exotic transmission links.
