            <div class="comment-content">Two cents: when discussing stuff that change infrequently, we&#39;ve found that YAML is good enough. Nevertheless, when it&#39;s about things with daily changes (also see firewall rules), it&#39;s a pain to manage it using text files directly.<br />

<p>To that end, our approach has been to implement a 2-step process: first step is DB/Excel-to-YAML/JSON, second step is YAML/JSON-to-devices. This way, we&#39;re able to enjoy advantages from both approaches albeit the pain of writing the &quot;glue&quot; between states.</p>

<p>That said, it seems that Dolt (especially as a backend for ~~NetBox~~ Nautobot) is a very interesting approach to &quot;marry&quot; the two in a more structured way...</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>@Nikos: Thanks for the comment - looks like you went down this path: https://www.ipspace.net/kb/DataModels/65-Data-Transformation.html</p>

<p>&quot;This way, we&#39;re able to enjoy advantages from both approaches albeit the pain of writing the &quot;glue&quot; between states.&quot; &lt;&lt; This is sometimes called &quot;squashed sausage effect&quot;. You can&#39;t escape the complexity, you can only try to contain it, and sometimes you can decide where you want to push it to.</p>

<p>As for Dolt: it&#39;s a great idea, but to use it with an IPAM/CMDB system you&#39;d have to make that system Dolt/branch aware. Maybe N2C will get there with Nautobot.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Our plan is very much to integrate Dolt as an option for the backend for Nautobot to cover the use case described by @Nikos. We have been talking to our customers for a few years to this problem, and over the past 6 months, several have come to us looking for solutions, so it looks like many more are running into these issues.</p>
