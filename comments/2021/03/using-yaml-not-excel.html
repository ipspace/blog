            <div class="comment-content">Two cents: when discussing stuff that change infrequently, we&#39;ve found that YAML is good enough. Nevertheless, when it&#39;s about things with daily changes (also see firewall rules), it&#39;s a pain to manage it using text files directly.<br />

<p>To that end, our approach has been to implement a 2-step process: first step is DB/Excel-to-YAML/JSON, second step is YAML/JSON-to-devices. This way, we&#39;re able to enjoy advantages from both approaches albeit the pain of writing the &quot;glue&quot; between states.</p>

<p>That said, it seems that Dolt (especially as a backend for ~~NetBox~~ Nautobot) is a very interesting approach to &quot;marry&quot; the two in a more structured way...</p>
