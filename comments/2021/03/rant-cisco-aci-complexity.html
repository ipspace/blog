            <div class="comment-content"><p>This is what you will end up by teaching networking to coders.</p>

<p>Unless they get this basic point that they need to create some abstraction layer for interaction to simplify the consumption and breaking everything down to smallest of objects for programmability, flexibility and extensibility in automation/coding terms doesn&#39;t mean everyone should go down to that level when putting this to life.</p>

<p>Though network engineers learning automation are no different either unless they are doing it for full time to taste the real flavors of it</p>

<p>and at some point I just hope that people will stop believing in those both sets of unicorns and rather invest into simple Operational model which would bring them together and make it work while keeping it simple.</p>
