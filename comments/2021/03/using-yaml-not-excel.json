         "html": "Two cents: when discussing stuff that change infrequently, we&#39;ve found that YAML is good enough. Nevertheless, when it&#39;s about things with daily changes (also see firewall rules), it&#39;s a pain to manage it using text files directly.<br />\n\n<p>To that end, our approach has been to implement a 2-step process: first step is DB/Excel-to-YAML/JSON, second step is YAML/JSON-to-devices. This way, we&#39;re able to enjoy advantages from both approaches albeit the pain of writing the &quot;glue&quot; between states.</p>\n\n<p>That said, it seems that Dolt (especially as a backend for ~~NetBox~~ Nautobot) is a very interesting approach to &quot;marry&quot; the two in a more structured way...</p>\n",

You can&#39;t escape the complexity, you can only try to contain it, and sometimes you can decide where you want to push it to.</p>\n\n<p>As for Dolt: it&#39;s a great idea, but to use it with an IPAM/CMDB system you&#39;d have to make that system Dolt/branch aware. Maybe N2C will get there with Nautobot.</p>\n",

         "html": "<p>I am more or less covered by the other comments but I want to add one thing.\nExcel adds one more layer between the information and the data that is stored, with auto-formating. <strong>Example</strong>: You want to store an ip address so you type it and press enter. Excel thinks it&#39;s a number that you erroneously typed as text, since it&#39;s <em>digits.3digits.3digits.3digits</em> . So it removes the dots from the actual data and stores the info without them. This is done in order to help you but Excel doesn&#39;t tell you because it doesn&#39;t want to hurt your feelings.. \nNext thing you know, you write a script to automate data handling and in particular those ip addresses but the script crashes because, what do you know, <strong>this isn&#39;t an ip address!</strong> \nTrue story.\n<strong>Stay away from Excel. Yaml is fine.</strong></p>\n",
