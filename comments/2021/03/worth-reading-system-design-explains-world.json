Also, this quote from Joel Spolsky&#39;s 2000 post made me laugh:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re programmers. Programmers are, in their hearts, architects, and the first thing they want to do when they get to a site is to bulldoze the place flat and build something grand. We&rsquo;re not excited by incremental renovation: tinkering, improving, planting flower beds.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Substitute &quot;networkers&quot; for &quot;programmer&quot; and it&#39;s spot on ;-)</p>\n",
