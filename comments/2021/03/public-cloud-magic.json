Overall, looks like Google makes heavy use of BGP, IS-IS and MPLS to scale their infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p>Also, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but surely MPLS is a viable technology to build L3 virtual network if one doesn&#39;t want to resort to Overlay, no? Overlay is complex and therefore slow. MPLS is simpler and faster. The downside with MPLS is the more VRFs you have, the more CAM/TCAM resources are required and this can prove prohibitive given how scarce they are even in modern ASICs.    </p>\n",
