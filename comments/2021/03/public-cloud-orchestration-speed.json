The reason is that it fails over in a few seconds whereas the UDR change takes 1-2 minutes. Moreover, I personally don&#39;t see any win in complexity terms either as, in the case of UDR change, one still has to implement some sort of failure detection mechanism.</p>\n\n<p>So, once again, I choose to put the complexity in ARM/Ansible/Terraform templates that deploy the sandwich architecture - write once, solve until the next API change :)</p>\n",
