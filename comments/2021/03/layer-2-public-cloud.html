            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hello Ivan,</p>

<p>As Oracle Consulting, I have personally implemented together with Palo Alto professional services, clustering solutions relying on secondary IP moving from one instance to another, for an active-standby Palo Alto clusters on OCI.</p>

<p>Is it good idea to put a virtual appliance in cloud another is another topic &#x1F605;</p>

<p>But the result was sub-second failover under load. No session drop.</p>

<p>The API call to move a &laquo;&nbsp;VIP&nbsp;&raquo; (what is called a Secondary IP in OCI terms) is fast. Like no comparison with what the PAN PS team saw on other clouds. &#x1F605;</p>

<p>Regarding L2 extension, it is intra Availability Domain &laquo;&nbsp;only&nbsp;&raquo; (equivalent to AZ). Yet, traffic in a region, nor the peering gateways are not billed upon.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hi &Ccedil;etin,</p>

<p>Thanks a million for the feedback. So glad to hear someone got the orchestration system architecture right (as opposed to $anotherCloud where it takes seconds to do anything useful).</p>

<p>As for L2 extension, it would be nice to see how far it scales, but I totally understand you can&#39;t share those numbers.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I know that you have <a href="https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/08/selecting-public-cloud.html">your reservations</a> regarding cloud networking exploration and there is a finite amount of time for each day, but I bet you would be really surprised by the user experience using OCI Networking services.</p>

<p>In region services are basically free to explore (no billing cost associated for vcn, data transfer, ephemeral/reserved public ip, gateways, etc ...).</p>

<p>Private connectivity: You only have to start worrying about cost if you want to test FastConnect or your egress traffic is more than 10TB/month (Managed VPN have no associated cost, FastConnect cost DO cover the transfer costs).</p>

<p>Testing L2 Network requires a 3-node VMware Cloud Foundation cluster as a starting point, using OCVS (Oracle Cloud VMware Solution): you have to be bold to test with your own credit card :-D</p>

<p>An OCVS cluster can be up to 64 ESXi hosts -&gt; that&#39;s an ESXi cluster with 3328 Cores + 48TB Ram. Each OCVS cluster gets his own set of L2 segments.
I did not had the opportunity to work on such large OVCS clusters, so I don&#39;t have specific numbers to share :-)</p>

<p>But let&#39;s do some theory-craft for fun of it:</p>

<ul>
<li>assuming a fair 5:1 vCPU:CPU consolidation ration, that gives 33280 vCPUs (counting HT) at 100% load, 23296 vCPUs at 70% load</li>
<li>assuming a 2-vCPUs single vnic VMs, that&#39;s ~11648 MAC addresses to handle for each (such LARGE) OCVS cluster. Bigger VMs = less MAC addresses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is it a big number?</p>

<p>A more reasonable ESXi cluster that we would probably see around in the typical enterprise, would be between 8 and 16 hosts -&gt; ~720 MAC addresses for a 16 hosts cluster with the same assumptions.</p>
