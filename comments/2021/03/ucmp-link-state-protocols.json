Implementation was done on CRS and ASR9k.\nThe first one did want to implement bundle/link aggregation (even for ECMP) and had different link speeds between 2 routers. He used UCMP instead of mixed speed bundles.\nThe second one had almost the same use case for overseas interconnection with continent across long-distance/exotic transmission links.\nFred</p>\n",
