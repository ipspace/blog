No session drop.</p>\n\n<p>The API call to move a &laquo;&nbsp;VIP&nbsp;&raquo; (what is called a Secondary IP in OCI terms) is fast. Like no comparison with what the PAN PS team saw on other clouds. &#x1F605;</p>\n\n<p>Regarding L2 extension, it is intra Availability Domain &laquo;&nbsp;only&nbsp;&raquo; (equivalent to AZ). Yet, traffic in a region, nor the peering gateways are not billed upon.</p>\n",
