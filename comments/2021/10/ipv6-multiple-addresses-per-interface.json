Tried running both at the same time, but got lots of strange connectivity issues, so I disabled one.  Of course the firewall I use can do 464 or 646 but not NatPT.  The whole multi-homed but not a BGP AS, still a problem.  Time to bring back the blog posts on CLNS again, even though it&#39;s too late?  lol</p>\n",
