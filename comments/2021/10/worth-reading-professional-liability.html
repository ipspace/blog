            <div class="comment-content"><p>Excellent write-up. There are three different things that need to be looked at: Functionality, security and operations (configuration). And not all of them can be attributed to the same person. In terms of commercial products if configured properly, the problem is the lack of proper quality assurance. FIPS and NIAP fail to properly evaluate products and their security. For Common Criteria it depends on the Security Target and the evaluation depth. The entire system is broken, including the evaluation by NIST and NIAP.
While Layer 8 (user) might contribute to security and functionality issues by suboptimal behavior, it all starts with the products themselves.</p>
