            <div class="comment-content"><p>it seems my guy made a mistake in this statement &quot; One idea could be to use BFD echo mode in the data plane with a short detection interval and a control plane session with a long detection interval&quot; bfd is either done on software and RP who take care of sending both control and echo packets or its offloaded to hardware. just my two cents but i think bfd is only necessary  when it doesn&#39;t share fate with control plane </p>
