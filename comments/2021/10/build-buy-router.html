            <div class="comment-content"><p>According to my experience the procurement cost of a router (including hardware and software) is usually just 10-20% of the overall total cost of ownership (TCO).</p>

<p>The biggest cost factors are project management, deployment, testing, documentation, long term operations, business integration, related business capabilities, training, maintaining know-how, incident management, problem management, change management, etc.</p>

<p>This is why companies like Cisco are so successful. Because they are focusing on the overall picture... They call it &quot;business outcome&quot;.</p>

<p>And the big guys can always kill your pet project if they want. Since they have so much resources. You really have to find a niche that is not interesting for them, if you want to survive with your own build...</p>
