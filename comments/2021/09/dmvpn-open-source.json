It is a simple, efficient, and flexible VPN protocol.</p>\n\n<p>From a network engineer perspective, it reminds me of a GRE tunnel, but with easy and efficient encryption, and it&#39;s UDP instead of IP 47.</p>\n\n<p>From a security perspective, it uses modern crypto without risk of cipher downgrade or protocol misconfiguration.</p>\n\n<p>From a developer perspective, it&#39;s not much different than configuring SSH sessions.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I had not heard of Innernet and holy smokes does it have potential to be a DMVPN replacement.</p>\n",
