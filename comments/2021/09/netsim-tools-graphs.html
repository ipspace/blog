Is there a documentation about your software design/philosophy? I saw that there are some comments in your code (no blaming) which help but it&#39;s still hard for me to follow.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I&#39;m positive there are tons of good programming or software design/engineering books out there that will help you get started, but I wouldn&#39;t know what to recommend -- I went over some of those hurdles in 1980s.</p>

<p>Programming is not my core business, and so there&#39;s no documentation on my software design philosophy. On a somewhat tangential note, you wouldn&#39;t believe how many programmers claim there&#39;s no need for code comments because their code is obvious and self-documenting ;)</p>

<p>If you have any specific question just send it my way; if you&#39;d like to implement a new feature in netsim-tools, open a GitHub issue and we&#39;ll go from there.</p>
