            <div class="comment-content"><p>Facebook&#39;s FBOSS uses non-stop forwarding (ala the &#39;warm boot&#39; feature) to manage a large fraction of their global data center.  Lots of details about it in our Sigcomm paper, e.g., section 5:</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I&#39;ve just read thru the paper, and from FB&#39;s own admission, NSF/warm-boot highly complicates state management between FBOSS, routing daemons..and has resulted in a major outage -- and probably many more not mentioned -- due to complex feature interactions between warm-boot, BGP graceful restart, and the Kerberos library. Timing mismatch between these features resulted in the outage, which I&#39;m pretty sure took them considerable pain to resolve. That&#39;s why in the very next section (7.2) that follows the mentioning of warm-boot -- which itself is used to facilitate FB&#39;s rapid deployment practice -- they mentioned the side effect of rapid deployment. </p>

<p>All in all, FB&#39;s experience seems to conclusively prove Ivan&#39;s overarching theme here: NSF and the rest of its voodoo result in hidden complexity that are best left untouched. Complexity, be it in feature or in topological design, or both, can result in nonlinear effects that cause major outages, as in FB&#39;s -- and plenty other -- case. And the worst thing about nonlinear effects is they cannot be modelled, and therefore, predicted. They only seem obvious in hindsight, after the fact, but at the time they happen, depending on the level of complexity, we might find ourselves scratching our heads for days. Complexity always results in fragility, and so is never a good thing. KISS.</p>
