               "html": "<p>I think this article is missing context. Without the boost license, the scheduler has the capability to guarantee to a high degree proper performance to all tasks (packet forwarding, QOS, Filtering, etc). When you enable the boost license, the scheduler will schedule all cores to 100% with many run-to-complete tasks. So that means that the predictability of your performance goes out of the window.</p>\n\n<p>So its (as always) a trade-off.</p>\n",

This went over like a lead balloon with customers, so they removed the throughput licensing for the newer Catalyst 8200/8300/8500 series routers intended to replace the ISR 4Ks which came out in 2020. This is only for the Catalyst 8000s running &quot;autonomous mode&quot; (i.e. traditional standalone IOS-XE), throughput licensing still exists if you want to run them in SD-WAN mode.</p>\n",

They charge what they can get away with and seem like they are on a never ending quest to squeeze out more from their current customer base. I love Cisco so much but hope they stop the madness. They seem to overcharge until competition starts to pull business away, and then they just lower their prices once they risk losing marketshare and it&#39;s &quot;forgive and forget&quot; about all the time they took advantage of their dominant position. Hope they change this.</p>\n\n<p>Of course I could go on and on on QA that feels like beta testing in prod and poor user experience of their user interfaces but we&#39;ll save that for a second &quot;I love you but need you to change&quot; rant about Cisco :)</p>\n",
