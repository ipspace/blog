               "html": "<p>I think this article is missing context. Without the boost license, the scheduler has the capability to guarantee to a high degree proper performance to all tasks (packet forwarding, QOS, Filtering, etc). When you enable the boost license, the scheduler will schedule all cores to 100% with many run-to-complete tasks. So that means that the predictability of your performance goes out of the window.</p>\n\n<p>So its (as always) a trade-off.</p>\n",

This went over like a lead balloon with customers, so they removed the throughput licensing for the newer Catalyst 8200/8300/8500 series routers intended to replace the ISR 4Ks which came out in 2020. This is only for the Catalyst 8000s running &quot;autonomous mode&quot; (i.e. traditional standalone IOS-XE), throughput licensing still exists if you want to run them in SD-WAN mode.</p>\n",
