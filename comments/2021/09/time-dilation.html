            <div class="comment-content"><p>I love this post, and just wanted to comment a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Many &quot;Flipped classroom&quot; proposers suggest the use of video lectures for individual student work at home, while in-person time in the class devotes to active work. I have seen &quot;gurus&quot; suggesting that the FC teacher should record videos &quot;live&quot; (e.g. simple screen capturing) without any editing, because otherwise he will spend too much time creating the videos and the overhead will be unaffordable. You opened my eyes to the specific problem: they are passing their overheads to the listeners. More and more frequent nowadays.</p></li>
<li><p>Although some concepts are better explained in a video, &quot;most of us read faster than talk&quot;, together with the fact that you can easily skim a text but not a video, makes books and written posts really valuable. </p></li>
</ul>

            <div class="comment-content">Regarding the FC video editing: considering that the video lectures would be reused more than once, it&#39;s even more a total BS excuse covering their laziness.<br />
