I have seen &quot;gurus&quot; suggesting that the FC teacher should record videos &quot;live&quot; (e.g. simple screen capturing) without any editing, because otherwise he will spend too much time creating the videos and the overhead will be unaffordable. You opened my eyes to the specific problem: they are passing their overheads to the listeners. More and more frequent nowadays.</p></li>\n<li><p>Although some concepts are better explained in a video, &quot;most of us read faster than talk&quot;, together with the fact that you can easily skim a text but not a video, makes books and written posts really valuable. </p></li>\n</ul>\n",
