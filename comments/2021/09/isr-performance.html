            <div class="comment-content"><p>ASR 1000 series have also the same performance limitation schema, you have to purchase the throughput level license.</p>

<p>https://www.cisco.com/c/en_in/products/collateral/routers/asr-1000-series-aggregation-services-routers/datasheet-c78-731632.html</p>

<p>Also note that performance is the aggregatted inbound traffic of all interfaces, so for a bidirectional 1 Gbps traffic performance you need at least a 2Gbps license.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I think this article is missing context. Without the boost license, the scheduler has the capability to guarantee to a high degree proper performance to all tasks (packet forwarding, QOS, Filtering, etc). When you enable the boost license, the scheduler will schedule all cores to 100% with many run-to-complete tasks. So that means that the predictability of your performance goes out of the window.</p>

<p>So its (as always) a trade-off.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>@Rens: While you&#39;re technically correct in your description of the impact of CPU overload, that&#39;s how routers behaved since 1980s and charging more (boost license) to get worse overall experience makes absolutely no sense.</p>

<p>Also, one would expect a router to generate an error message saying &quot;I&#39;m overloaded, please do something&quot; instead of &quot;pay more to squeeze the last bits out of the CPU&quot;.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>@Rens: In the &quot;guaranteed service&quot; case, it would make perfect sense to rate-limit the total throughput and make that a configurable option. I would love to see a vendor doing that <em>for the quality-of-experience</em> reasons.</p>

<p>What we&#39;re discussing is a clearly-less-than-optimal marketing decision that has nothing to do with technology (see other comments, there&#39;s nobody else saying &quot;it makes sense&quot;), but I guess one&#39;s perception of it depends on which side of the fence one&#39;s sitting. </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>That&#39;s true, but the point here it&#39;s nobody would expect a performance limit so severe and obscure, some of them have a price tag over 1k and do not offer enough performance to even use a 100mbps link</p>

<p>Boost license it&#39;s also quite expensive, as much as the router itself.</p>

<p>These routers are current substitutes for 1900/2900/3900 but do not perform even as much as an 88x for simple use cases.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Cisco added software based throughput rate limit licensing when the ISR 4Ks came out in 2014. This went over like a lead balloon with customers, so they removed the throughput licensing for the newer Catalyst 8200/8300/8500 series routers intended to replace the ISR 4Ks which came out in 2020. This is only for the Catalyst 8000s running &quot;autonomous mode&quot; (i.e. traditional standalone IOS-XE), throughput licensing still exists if you want to run them in SD-WAN mode.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>This is my biggest frustration with Cisco. Their engineering and product teams build great tech and then someone on the business side always ruins it with licensing. They charge what they can get away with and seem like they are on a never ending quest to squeeze out more from their current customer base. I love Cisco so much but hope they stop the madness. They seem to overcharge until competition starts to pull business away, and then they just lower their prices once they risk losing marketshare and it&#39;s &quot;forgive and forget&quot; about all the time they took advantage of their dominant position. Hope they change this.</p>

<p>Of course I could go on and on on QA that feels like beta testing in prod and poor user experience of their user interfaces but we&#39;ll save that for a second &quot;I love you but need you to change&quot; rant about Cisco :)</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>We ran into this in a recent deployment when IPSec traffic hit the ceiling. Figuring out the issue, then purchasing the &quot;fix&quot; (which required an IOS update) is not great. And even the process of adding the license to the device is off-putting. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just not worth the extra cost or the bruises. Between performance licensing and the feature licensing (Sec vs AXV vs V vs AX vs VSec), I am looking and using other things like Vyos and pfSense/TNSR. </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>The below was my experience with the 4000series back in 2015 when we were deploying them for IPSec tunnels on 100mbps full duplex circuits;</p>

<p>Throughput figures provided are total throughput so 100mbps performance on the platform would have only been sufficient for 50mbps full duplex circuit and as such insufficient so we had to make sure every router was capable of 200mbps for full duplex, and then we ran IPsec over the tunnels expecting uncapped throughput.</p>

<p>This was probably my fault at the time for not reading the documentation in full depth but without the additional Hseck license I was limited to 85mbps!  I do believe this was patched out in later revisions of IOS, but at the time it felt like Cisco were being underhanded with this and weren&#39;t upfront about this initially.</p>

<p>Cisco licensing used to be relatively easy to understand but in recent years it feels like its just disjointed and confusing.</p>
