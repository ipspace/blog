            <div class="comment-content"><p>Last month, I made a lab test with FX version using Spirent with 48x25Gbps. We got a maximum of ~68% of throughput without loss. If I&rsquo;m not wrong, it represents almost 1600 Mpps.
About the main focus of the blog post, I agree that the requirements are so important to spend money properly according to the project. &#x1F605;</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Just thinking out loud here, but if your measure is the current environment, wouldn&rsquo;t the current switches maximum pps be the limiting factor? I say this because going back to requirements if the goal is simply to replace the current implementation with no less than what it can do, this seems like a reasonable limitation. I would think the it is a reasonable assumption that most environments will grow, require more traffic, faster delivery, etc. as the source to destination interface SERDES ratio continues to increase, timely delivery becomes more and more important. Lower latency from
Experience can definitely decrease buffer utilization during burst. So the question really becomes what feature can we love without to benefit packet delivery? And at what cost financially? It always comes down to economics doesn&rsquo;t it. Anyways, great article as always!</p>
