On a somewhat tangential note, you wouldn&#39;t believe how many programmers claim there&#39;s no need for code comments because their code is obvious and self-documenting ;)</p>\n\n<p>If you have any specific question just send it my way; if you&#39;d like to implement a new feature in netsim-tools, open a GitHub issue and we&#39;ll go from there.</p>\n",
