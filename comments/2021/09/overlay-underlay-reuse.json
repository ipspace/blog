You could either ignore VMware recommendations and connect all management traffic to the underlay, or implement tenant networks with NSX-T, or live with the consequences of the decision to implement tenant networks on ToR switches. </p>\n\n<p>On a tangential topic, I&#39;ve been ranting against the idea of implementing tenant networks in hardware for over a decade, but of course nobody listens.</p>\n",

Alongside a commercial off-the-shelf self-service &quot;cloud management&quot; frontend for end users.</p>\n\n<p>So far i have seen that the Nexus9k BGP EVPN control-plane is far from 100% reliable and it is not hard at all to make it &quot;misbehave&quot; by, for example, pushing wrong or too much config, or deleting objects in the wrong order.\nIn this project this part is dynamic, because it is based on front-end end-user self-service.\nSo in this respect - misbehaving tenant VRF is one problem, but misbehaving vSAN, vSphere cluster, other fundamental infrastructure services is a totally different problem to have. In my view none of the &quot;benefits&quot; that VXLAN/EVPN gives are needed for the infrastructure services, hence skipping further abstraction layers and most importantly dependencies is the best decision.</p>\n\n<p>Does it make sense?</p>\n",
