            <div class="comment-content"><p>Another approach could be adding and running a script that clones a git repo where you store your data. Obviously this is not beneficial during development (every change had to be commited/pushed) but works well when the container is part of a CI/CD pipeline.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>&quot;Containers seem to be an an answer to every challenge one might have these days&quot;.  Yes, and unfortunately this post is case-in-point.  You are throwing the kitchen sink into what should probably be a VM.  Mounting your home directory in read-write mode into a container is a fantastic recipe for a really bad headache.  How do I know your container isn&#39;t going to post my SSH keys to PasteBin after I start it up?  I&#39;m not making an accusation; simply stating that not everyone on DockerHub is a saint.  Convenience often comes at the price of security, and that is a dangerous tradeoff these days.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>&quot;You are throwing the kitchen sink into what should probably be a VM&quot; &lt;&lt; Sure, I have another recipe somewhere to build a Ubuntu VM with Vagrant, or you could use almost the same recipe.</p>

<p>Some people are OK with VMs. I use them because I had to set up Vagrant/Virtualbox on my Mac anyway, so why bother with Docker. Other people prefer containers. There is no right answer.</p>

<p>&quot;...simply stating that not everyone on DockerHub is a saint&quot; &lt;&lt; Agreed. You know how you can easily get around that? Build your own container after vetting the build recipe you got off the Internet. That&#39;s why my build recipes (Dockerfiles) are on GitHub.</p>
