            <div class="comment-content"><p>that happens when marketing wins over engineering, and both the vendor you mentioned are the champions in this. it&#39;s time for someone (like Ivan) to explain you can&#39;t do things on a shoestring. </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>For some additional historical context, similar to this L2/L3 demarcation there was the convergence of &quot;Service Delivery Platforms&quot; and &quot;Edge Routers&quot; around 2002: https://www.lightreading.com/ethernet-ip/edge-routing-gets-service-friendly/d/d-id/581040</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Re router vs switch, I think we indeed need to place things in their historical context to get a clear distinction. People who argue that MPLS is tunneling for example, miss the point because they argue out of context. Tunneling is a blanket term, so it can be attributed to anything, but the history of MPLS shows clearly it was an evolution of ATM, and so, it should be associated with virtual circuit, not tunnel. </p>

<p>Going by that, a router was originally defined as a device that moves packets based on L3 information, and a switch, layer 2. Whether the function is performed in hardware or software is beside the point.  So anything that makes use of L3 or higher-layer headers is a router. A layer 3 or Layer 7 switch therefore, is just marketing BS. </p>

<p>As for the Cat6500, our core and Internet border routers are both Cat6807-XL, a beefed-up form of Cat6500, and they&#39;re rock solid because we don&#39;t turn on a lot of nightmarish featurism like those Dmytro described. Cat6500 architecture is close to an engineering masterpiece, with the crossbar having a 3x speedup (for supervisor 720), so its work-conserving capacity is high. Even now we don&#39;t have routers of similar size having better architecture, if not worse -- in this regard, the promise of whitebox switching enabling innovation in hardware seems to have fallen flat. And another thing should serve as a proxy for SDN&#39;s expected performance: A Cat6500 (with supervisor engine 720) without DFC has a switch capacity of 30Mpps, while one with DFC, 400Mpps. </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I think the main difference between routers and switches is the variety of supported interface types. For instance, the router can support at least two interface types from the list: sdh, pdh, atm, ethernet, microwave, voice, serial, etc.
In addition, routers are usually more versatile in terms of feature sets.</p>
