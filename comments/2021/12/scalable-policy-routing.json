Diagrams fixed.</p>\n\n<p>As for weight:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It&#39;s not a BGP attribute;</li>\n<li>It&#39;s not standardized because it is internal to a box;</li>\n<li>It&#39;s available in BGP implementations from multiple vendors (at least Arista EOS).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I left weight as the preferred solution in the text, but added a footnote explaining it is not available in all BGP implementations. I also added alternative mechanisms (LocPref, IGP cost) to the main text.</p>\n",
