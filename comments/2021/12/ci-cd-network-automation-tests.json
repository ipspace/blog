Virtual routers are far from being the same as physical routers. In most of the simulators, you can only test platform independent features.\nBut do you have a clear understanding of which features are platform dependent? Sometimes it is not that easy to find out...\nThere are also potential software only features that are removed in a hardware assisted architecture. So it is not just a one way problem.</p>\n",
