            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Ivan, this sentence is not always correct: ....while VMware NSX-T requires all controllers to be in one location.</p>

<p>NSX-T manager appliances running the controller supports also a distributed design option over three locations (typically with three subnets) without or with (preference ) front LB (for management purpose) to avoid in case of a location failure the lost of the majority. For sure all needs to be within supported RTT.</p>

<p>Maybe you consider this in your blog too
