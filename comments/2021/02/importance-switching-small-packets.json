You and Ivan are are an explosively powerful mix. :) <br />\nTotally agree with you on small packets. <br />\nA couple of things though for the time being: <br />\nI just want to take a stand for once in defense of the high-end vendors as they are asked for hundreds of sometimes pretty exotic features by their big Service Provider customers and therefore the code and the chipset gets as you pointed out extremely populated with stuff. I have the impression it is inevitable and it&#39;s not just made on purpose to make more money as such.  I reckon they&#39;d rather avoid it if they could. <br />\nThe other thing is if you can open up another blog soon on the interesting. \nstatement: &quot;Self-similar traffic also makes big buffer mostly useless,&quot; :)    </p>\n\n<p>Last thing: I might be naive but our market is in need even more urgently now that the scenario is getting fuzzier and fuzzier of an independent testing facility for functionality AND performance.  Universities should be involved and the vendors too of course. Stringent test procedures and well documented and thus reproducible. In short, proper stuff.   </p>\n\n<p>Cheers/Ciao <br />\nAndrea  </p>\n",
