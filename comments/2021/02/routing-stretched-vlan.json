Not good, but not a big deal.</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine you spread them across two data centers. &quot;Not good&quot; becomes &quot;WTF&quot; as all inter-VLAN traffic goes to the other side to be routed.</p>\n\n<p>Enter the magic world of HSRP filtering: if you filter HSRP hello packets on the DCI link, the routers don&#39;t know someone else is using the same IP/MAC address on the other side.</p>\n\n<p>Is this sane? Definitely not. Does it work? Sort-of. Is it promoted by a large networking vendor? You bet.</p>\n\n<p>For more details just google for &quot;HSRP filtering&quot; &#x1F60A;</p>\n",
