For sure all needs to be within supported RTT.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe you consider this in your blog too\nOliver</p>\n\n<p>Maybe </p>\n",

This is a nice Vmware doc about the relevant NSX-T multi location solutions and the starting point for any person working with NSX. \nCheers Oliver</p>\n",

If a vendor decides not to publish a design document that in itself might indicate the potential quality of that design, and I would never advise anyone to use it.
