            <div class="comment-content"><p>Wow, I wasn&#39;t expecting a blog post for my use case...
I&#39;m not offended, I was expecting a kick in the ass :-D</p>

<p>I knew the choice was bad, but didn&#39;t knew how to make it work better.
I&#39;ll lab it and see if we can still enhance the production network.</p>

<p>Thanks for your knowledge.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>@mrh: Imagine you have four core switches acting as routers. They run HSRP/VRRP/whatever, and only one of the becomes active forwarder. Not good, but not a big deal.</p>

<p>Now imagine you spread them across two data centers. &quot;Not good&quot; becomes &quot;WTF&quot; as all inter-VLAN traffic goes to the other side to be routed.</p>

<p>Enter the magic world of HSRP filtering: if you filter HSRP hello packets on the DCI link, the routers don&#39;t know someone else is using the same IP/MAC address on the other side.</p>

<p>Is this sane? Definitely not. Does it work? Sort-of. Is it promoted by a large networking vendor? You bet.</p>

<p>For more details just google for &quot;HSRP filtering&quot; &#x1F60A;</p>
