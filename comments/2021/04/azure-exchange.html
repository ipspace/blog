            <div class="comment-content"><p>Exchange 4.0 was an basically an upgrade for MS Mail 3.0, which was really competing against CC Mail. When Lotus Notes came out there was really no easy upgrade path from CC Mail, so customers were going to be starting from scratch anyway. Many enterprise customers already owned Microsoft BackOffice because of SQL server, so many choose to go the Microsft route. It is fair to say that Exchange 4.0 was not widely adopted, but Exchange 5 was out with a year and it really took off after that. To the best of my recollection Netscape never had an email server product, if so I never came across it at any of my customers.  </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Netscape had server products (including a Mail server) and many were available on multiple platforms, but others (like their calendar server) were only available on Solaris, alienating their Windows customers.  They claimed to want to partner with enterprises, but then stood firm on embracing Internet standards leaving out features like email read receipt, which enterprises were already familiar with in Microsoft Mail.  Netscape was as much responsible for their own demise as Microsoft.</p>
