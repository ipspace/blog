So rather than worry about some possible 5 tupple connection, you create an image that&rsquo;s only able to do what it is supposed to.  Then, being contained in its name space, it can only do what it should within the bounds it is supposed to be in.  </p>\n\n<p>This way, the application takes on some of the responsibilities of maintaining security, and you&rsquo;re not in a place where you must rely on the network to save you. </p>\n\n<p>Oh, and don&rsquo;t discount certificates as a way of securing communication.  There are a number of offerings that facilitate this in a programmatic way. </p>\n",
