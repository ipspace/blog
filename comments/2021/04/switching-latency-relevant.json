Using a congestion control mechanism that keeps buffer utilization (and thus buffer delay) low, such as Datacenter TCP, is probably much more relevant than having a low forwarding latency in the intermediate devices. For example, an average occupancy of 20 packets per input buffer increases latency by 24 &mu;s when using 10G, way larger than typical zero-load forwarding latency.</p>\n",
