  html: Hi,<br /><br />I listened to the podcast and found it interesting, thank you.<br
    /><br />One thing that stuck in my mind was the mention that IPv6 anycast is &quot;hard&quot;.<br
    /><br />I know from experience that anycasting DNS (IPv4) does introduce complexity
    and multi-homing servers can sometimes be tricky.<br /><br />I am contemplating
    IPv6 anycast for our company&#39;s new DNS deployment and I want to know, are
    there any significant challenges over and above those of IPv4 anycast?<br /><br
    />Thank you!
