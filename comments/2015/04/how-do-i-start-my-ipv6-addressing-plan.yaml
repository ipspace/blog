  html: My rules of thumb:<br /><br />If the routing and firewalling between the VRFs
    (the different subnets in the WAN sites) is happening centralized in the data
    centers (since most of the traffic is northbound anyway), then I&#39;d use Type
    First addressing = one big subnet/supernet for each VRF, summarized in the WAN
    edge. This is how my customer implementations usually work (currently in IPv4-only
    world).<br /><br />If the routing and firewalling between the VRFs is happening
    locally in each site, then I would consider using Location First addressing.<br
    /><br />Wildcard-style masking with IPv6 addresses would be great, yes!<br />

  html: 'We actually use type-first addressing, for the reason you mentioned: simplified
    security enforcement. Our firewall up until very recently couldn&#39;t do discontiguous
    wildcards for IPv4 or IPv6, so using location-first would&#39;ve been way more
    complexity than needed. Not sure about our shiny new ASA, but it&#39;s not really
    relevant anymore cause we&#39;ve got this now and it works just fine. We have
    maybe 20 different subnet types (&quot;security zones&quot;) and 30 sites, so
    routing table size was never really a concern (especially since most sites are
    stubs).<br /><br />When I implemented IPv6 two years ago (I think, time flies...)
    I applied the same structure directly to IPv6 (with hex instead of base 10) and
    to me it&#39;s just pretty =)<br /><br />For example, zone 10 (administrative
    clients):<br />IPv4 10.10.site.0/24<br />IPv6 2001:db8:123:0a[site-in-hex]::/64<br
    /><br />Zone 110 (VoIP):<br />IPv4 10.110.site.0/24<br />IPv6 2001:db8:123:6e[site-in-hex]::/64'

  html: "Ivan,<br /><br />Very excited to see you cover my favorite IPv6 topic (shameless\
    \ book plug: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/IPv6-Address-Planning-Designing-Future/dp/1491902760/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430322720&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ipv6+address+planning\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\">IPv6 Address Planning, O&#39;Reilly</a>) with your usual high\
    \ level of expertise and practical guidance!<br /><br />A couple of considerations\
    \ perhaps of value to your enterprise readers:<br /><br />I\u2019ve run into many\
    \ enterprise administrators who will default to considering the use of ULA space\
    \ internally, i.e., the private/RFC 1918 equivalent, in IPv6 along with NAT66\
    \ at the enterprise perimeter. The reason typically given for this is a combination\
    \ of \u201Cthat\u2019s how we do it in IPv4\u201D along with some variation on\
    \ the \u201Csecurity through obscurity\u201D argument stemming from a general\
    \ discomfort for using \u201Cpublic\u201D (GUA) addresses internally. But there\u2019\
    s really no valid security reason for this configuration.<br /><br />Also, most\
    \ enterprises should consider getting a Provider Independent (PI) allocation from\
    \ their RIR (the requirements vary from region to region). Having a portable allocation\
    \ can help avoid unnecessary renumbering.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Tom"
