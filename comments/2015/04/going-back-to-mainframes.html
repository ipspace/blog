            <div class="comment-content">Love the SNA quote.  I usually equate OF to other switching technologies that worked similar (ATM, FR, etc.) but it is, fundamentally, the same thing.<br />I am more interested in trying to centralize the management plane and use standardized protocols and interfaces (NETCONF, YANG, Thrift, etc.) to inject config rather than completely messing with the CP.  </div>

            <div class="comment-content">It was the network folks who perfected the art of distributed system&#39;s while app folks were monolithic till few yrs back. Apps have become so much distributed that network started to fall behind and started to focus on the In_the_Box_Mentality. These are obvious from Network services which are more or less centralized. To add to the problem, network guys invited more protocols to make things really complex. Now the clock is ticking back!!.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I don&#39;t believe these technology transitions have much to do with the technology, but rather more to do with trying to break the stanglehold that one or two vendors have on the market.  It was IBM back in the good old mainframe days and it is pretty much Cisco now, in the networking arena anyway.  The other driver is always politics and who owns what, who controls what and so on.<br />All the virtualisation technology was invented by IBM and used on mainframes years ago, JCL decks and scripting languages like REXX was used as the orchestration glue to run the systems.  The hardware is smaller and the languages have changed, however, concepts, problems etc. are still the same.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Yep, I also come from the mainframe era 25 years ago. Subsequent to that I have been through two other central controller like implementations - ATM LANE and Infiniband. Both failed. Distributed control planes will prevail again but the industry will continuously try to re-invent and rebrand failed technology.</div>
