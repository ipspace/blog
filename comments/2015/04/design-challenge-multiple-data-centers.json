It&#39;s possible that&#39;s just a rate limit on a modern transport platform, but unless it was a direct migration from a SONET platform it&#39;s an odd rate to use.<br /><br />Dark fibre plus a passive xWDM mux is often not that expensive either, possibly cheaper than a 10g metro circuit would be.<br />",

      "html": "We have used SRM combined with Recoverpoint over leased 10Gb links, 350+ miles between data centers with enough success to make it our current standard for &quot;DR&quot; apps. Always looking at other data replication products as they emerge. Beyond that, the app owners sometimes also utilize database replication, but we don&#39;t do much more than provide the plumbing for that. So far SRM has worked pretty well, especially considering that the DR site uses different IPs than the primary data center, so there is a re-IP. Also, a layer of global-DNS to point users to the right location after a DR move has occurred. YMMV.",

ZFS does block level differential replication, but it&#39;s not realtime.  You take a snapshot and it will just sync the changes to a remote host.  Tools like Veeam will do incremental VM backups as well and are highly integrated into ESX.   There are obviously VMWare DR tools already mentioned which work as well.    ESX has the ability to track just changed blocks so you aren&#39;t backing up the entire file.   <br /><br />Of course if you have a VM writing like 500GB a day to disk or something you are SOL. :) <br /><br />",

          "html": "Yes and no, while it&#39;s a nice enough tech and the features can make it nice and easy to debug (as long as the problem isn&#39;t clocking) it pretty much died at OC192, with many of the transmission systems never making it past OC48.<br /><br />And just because the protocol works doesn&#39;t mean the equipment still will, old equipment really does start to get unreliable in aggregate, and older gear often has fixed optics which will be wearing out by now.<br /><br />But, as reminded by someone out-of-band, this sort of transmission system may well still be reasonable outside of major markets. I&#39;m perhaps a little too used to my world where a single 10g is barely worth caring about.",

The expression &quot;telecom reliability&quot;, is not invented for fun, and it delivers something yet to be surpassed.<br /><br />It all depends on what is needed. <br />If you can live with slow reacting, sloppy and &quot;we hope the best&quot; delivery, then routed/switched networks is the way to go. :-)",
