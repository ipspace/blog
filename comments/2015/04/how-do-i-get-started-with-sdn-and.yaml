    html: I too am going through the Cisco ACI book as well, not bad and gives a good
      insight into ACI, good and ugly.  I suggest Ivan&#39;s training first, as using
      them myself for real world grounding, his links and the free training form VMware,
      plus read this book from Cisco which is good and covers storage and Nexus 1000v.   <br

  html: 'I currently reading through Cisco Press &quot;Policy Driven Data Center with
    ACI, The: Architecture, Concepts, and Methodology&quot;  so far it has a pretty
    decent introduction to what network virtualization is all about. Mainly focused
    on Cisco ACI, but provides understanding about other virtualization technologies'

  html: Another free and useful resource is the VMware Hands On Labs (labs.hol.vmware.com),
    where you&#39;ll find several different labs on NSX.  Just provide your email
    address and you&#39;ll have several hours to play around in a real lab environment
    with a lab guide.  And you can come back and try more labs (or the same lab) as
    many times as you want.<br /><br />Thanks for the mention, Ivan.<br /><br />Cheers,<br
