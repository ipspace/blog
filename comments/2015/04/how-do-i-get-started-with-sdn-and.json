I suggest Ivan&#39;s training first, as using them myself for real world grounding, his links and the free training form VMware, plus read this book from Cisco which is good and covers storage and Nexus 1000v.   <br /><br />Data Center Virtualization Fundamentals - Cisco Press 2014",

Just provide your email address and you&#39;ll have several hours to play around in a real lab environment with a lab guide.  And you can come back and try more labs (or the same lab) as many times as you want.<br /><br />Thanks for the mention, Ivan.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Brad",
