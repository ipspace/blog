      "html": "My rules of thumb:<br /><br />If the routing and firewalling between the VRFs (the different subnets in the WAN sites) is happening centralized in the data centers (since most of the traffic is northbound anyway), then I&#39;d use Type First addressing = one big subnet/supernet for each VRF, summarized in the WAN edge. This is how my customer implementations usually work (currently in IPv4-only world).<br /><br />If the routing and firewalling between the VRFs is happening locally in each site, then I would consider using Location First addressing.<br /><br />Wildcard-style masking with IPv6 addresses would be great, yes!<br />",

      "html": "We actually use type-first addressing, for the reason you mentioned: simplified security enforcement. Our firewall up until very recently couldn&#39;t do discontiguous wildcards for IPv4 or IPv6, so using location-first would&#39;ve been way more complexity than needed. Not sure about our shiny new ASA, but it&#39;s not really relevant anymore cause we&#39;ve got this now and it works just fine. We have maybe 20 different subnet types (&quot;security zones&quot;) and 30 sites, so routing table size was never really a concern (especially since most sites are stubs).<br /><br />When I implemented IPv6 two years ago (I think, time flies...) I applied the same structure directly to IPv6 (with hex instead of base 10) and to me it&#39;s just pretty =)<br /><br />For example, zone 10 (administrative clients):<br />IPv4 10.10.site.0/24<br />IPv6 2001:db8:123:0a[site-in-hex]::/64<br /><br />Zone 110 (VoIP):<br />IPv4 10.110.site.0/24<br />IPv6 2001:db8:123:6e[site-in-hex]::/64",

      "html": "Ivan,<br /><br />Very excited to see you cover my favorite IPv6 topic (shameless book plug: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/IPv6-Address-Planning-Designing-Future/dp/1491902760/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430322720&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ipv6+address+planning\" rel=\"nofollow\">IPv6 Address Planning, O&#39;Reilly</a>) with your usual high level of expertise and practical guidance!<br /><br />A couple of considerations perhaps of value to your enterprise readers:<br /><br />I\u2019ve run into many enterprise administrators who will default to considering the use of ULA space internally, i.e., the private/RFC 1918 equivalent, in IPv6 along with NAT66 at the enterprise perimeter. The reason typically given for this is a combination of \u201cthat\u2019s how we do it in IPv4\u201d along with some variation on the \u201csecurity through obscurity\u201d argument stemming from a general discomfort for using \u201cpublic\u201d (GUA) addresses internally. But there\u2019s really no valid security reason for this configuration.<br /><br />Also, most enterprises should consider getting a Provider Independent (PI) allocation from their RIR (the requirements vary from region to region). Having a portable allocation can help avoid unnecessary renumbering.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Tom",
