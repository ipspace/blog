    html: No idea. They have zero public documentation on their web site, which makes
      me totally uninterested in whatever it is they happen to be doing.

  html: Can PLUMgrid be compared to Nuage VSP in term of scalability? or it has all
    the burdens of a totally centralized SDN?<br /><br />They don&#39;t seem to use
    the intermediate &quot;VSC&quot;-thing that Nuage does, but they push the flow
    paths into their vswitches like Nuage.<br />

  html: 'Seems like there are 2 issues with the current line of thinking.<br /><br
    />1) Centralized Controller model.<br />2) OF scaling.<br /><br />With #1, seems
    like Centralized model such as ODL does not fly while well distributed model is
    required. Container world have embraced distributed model well. OVN taking the
    container world approach for VM&#39;s. I am not sure how OVN is different than
    using BGP RR model (a distributed model again).<br /><br />With #2, OF scaling
    is real problem for the underlay.  '
