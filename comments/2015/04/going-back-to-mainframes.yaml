  html: 'Love the SNA quote.  I usually equate OF to other switching technologies
    that worked similar (ATM, FR, etc.) but it is, fundamentally, the same thing.<br
    />I am more interested in trying to centralize the management plane and use standardized
    protocols and interfaces (NETCONF, YANG, Thrift, etc.) to inject config rather
    than completely messing with the CP.  '

  html: Is this what happen when young dudes try to take over the world? They have
    to repeat all the same mistakes?

  html: It was the network folks who perfected the art of distributed system&#39;s
    while app folks were monolithic till few yrs back. Apps have become so much distributed
    that network started to fall behind and started to focus on the In_the_Box_Mentality.
    These are obvious from Network services which are more or less centralized. To
    add to the problem, network guys invited more protocols to make things really
    complex. Now the clock is ticking back!!.

  html: I don&#39;t believe these technology transitions have much to do with the
    technology, but rather more to do with trying to break the stanglehold that one
    or two vendors have on the market.  It was IBM back in the good old mainframe
    days and it is pretty much Cisco now, in the networking arena anyway.  The other
    driver is always politics and who owns what, who controls what and so on.<br />All
    the virtualisation technology was invented by IBM and used on mainframes years
    ago, JCL decks and scripting languages like REXX was used as the orchestration
    glue to run the systems.  The hardware is smaller and the languages have changed,
    however, concepts, problems etc. are still the same.

  html: Yep, I also come from the mainframe era 25 years ago. Subsequent to that I
    have been through two other central controller like implementations - ATM LANE
    and Infiniband. Both failed. Distributed control planes will prevail again but
    the industry will continuously try to re-invent and rebrand failed technology.
