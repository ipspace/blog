  html: 'Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Actually I wrote a tech article about it last year because
    I didn&#39;t found good documentation about it. So I wrote about how Ntopng is
    working with nProbe and how to set up a Ntopng box capturing sFlows from every
    edge of the Network to get some overview. <br /><br />Here is the link, I think
    it is complementary to your work in some way : https://easyipv6.wordpress.com/2014/08/22/how-to-configure-ntopng-for-collecting-sflow-packets/<br
