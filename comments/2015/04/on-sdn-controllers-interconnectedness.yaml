    html: 'Really good one. In Petr&#39;s design, the SDN controller talks to every
      BGP router, so a bug in the controller would affect all routers (even though
      you could still implement protection mechanisms on the routers like maximum
      number of prefixes accepted from the BGP controller).<br /><br />However, compared
      to &quot;centralized control plane&quot; architectures, the BGP-based SDN has
      a crucial advantage: if the controller fails (or you kill it when it goes crazy),
      the network settles down to &quot;business-as-usual&quot; behavior.'

    html: 'Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Disclaimer: I work for HP networking and we do sell
      SDN controllers, apps, and OpenFlow hardware.<br /><br />It was great chatting
      with you at Interop last week. I think you&#39;re criticism of centralized controllers
      is spot-on, assuming that you&#39;re talking about an architecture where all
      control plane functionality is performed by the controller. <br /><br />HP has
      recognized this potential issue issue and has taken the approach of a hybrid
      control plane. Essentially, we put higher priority flow rules into the devices
      to enable exception based actions with a last priority rule that will forward
      off to the normal pipeline. <br /><br />If traffic goes through the OpenFlow
      table and doesn&#39;t match on any other rules, the last rule will say &quot;do
      what you would normally do&quot; and use the forwarding behavior defined by
      the traditional network control plane. The end result being, exactly as you
      described above. In the event that the controller goes away the network will
      settle down to &quot;business-as-usual&quot; behavior.<br /><br />We&#39;re
      still early on, but I think it&#39;s important to recognize that there are ways
      for us to mitigate some of the more obvious limitations of centralized controller
      architectures while still reaping the benefits.<br /><br />see you on the twitters!<br

  html: (Dons asbestos suit.) <br /><br />But what happens at the intersection of
    BGP and SDN?  For example, it seems to me that in Petr Lapukhov&#39;s BGP data
    center design, the BGP route reflector is a de facto SDN controller.  Would that
    approach then behave as you describe SDN rather than as you describe BGP?

    html: Not just Juniper and ALU, everyone (apart from VMware NSX ... at least so
      far) is going down that route, including next version of Hyper-V.

  html: This sounds like a page from the architecture whitepaper of a MP-BGP federated
    SDN controller, such as Opencontrail or Nuage. They use BGP to loosely couple
    their controllers, unlike previous generation controllers that use tighter coupling,
    for pretty much exactly the reasons you describe. Well that, and other BGP advantages
    such as scalability and provenness.<br /><br />No accident that Juniper and ALU
    went down that route, from experience they understand what is required to keep
    networks alive better than most of the originators of controllers based on Openflow
    or proprietary solutions.
