  html: As history repeats itself maybe we can look forward to someone reinventing
    frame relay and a virtual gateway to connect to it so that our SDNs can connect
    circa 1995. Past is future!<br /><br />https://books.google.com/books?id=2xAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=at%26T+sdn+service&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6zw1VZ-lC6ywsASwsoEQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwADgK

  html: Yep I remember the AT&amp;T, Lotus and Novell Server cloud solution offered
    back in 1994 etc. More like a  rough IaaS or hosting soluting back then. With
    AT&amp;T Frame-Relay network to your main and branch offices you can connect to
    AT&amp;T hosted Novell servers that ran Lotus applications etc. Multi-tenant via
    DLCI and bare metal server per client. It didn&#39;t take off due to security
    and the protocols and pipes of that time were too fat. But again, nothing new.

  html: I still think people invested in selling the SDN and Network Virtualisation
    &#39;Revolution&#39; are forgetting what the &#39;V&#39; in VLAN stands for....
    :p Networking has been virtual for decades, before servers were too. Now is just
    about scale out and automate up...
