    html: Perfectly valid question. Most of them assume the additional exposure of
      the network is limited due to ACLs and IPsec (and transport VRF if you use one).
      Some customers with higher security requirements use very specific ACLs that
      limit source IP addresses, and use per-peer IPsec keys or certificates.<br /><br
      />Obviously it&#39;s possible that there will be 0-day in Cisco IOS that will
      allow an intruder to send unidirectional traffic cloaked as IPsec, bypass all
      IPsec checks, and jump across VRFs (and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to learn
      3-letter agencies have it). However, while you should never say never, I do
      think other attack vectors are more likely.

    html: Also on the subject of attacks, DDoS. Internet uplinks are obviously more
      open to that than private WAN circuits (which should be essentially off-limits
      to outside equipment). We&#39;ve been hit with a DDoS attack more than once,
      and I&#39;m really glad we don&#39;t generally use IPSec tunnels over the internet
      for remote site transport. Would&#39;ve been rather bad if our internal transport
      networks had been hit aswell.<br /><br />And yeah, you could theoretically have
      backup WAN links, but in that case you&#39;d be paying MORE for the solution
      in total, not less. I see no scenario in which we&#39;d replace our backbone
      with VPN tunnels.

  html: Traditional WAN circuits also have significantly less attack surface.  Do
    Enterprises using fully Internet-based or Hybrid WANs have a Plan B for the possibly
    distant, but ultimately inevitable 0-day or PSIRT?  Does their business case analysis
    include the business impact of such an event?  Or are they assuming the the network
    is safe because the traffic is encrypted in IPSEC, and their router has ACLs limiting
    the traffic?<br /><br />Please note that I don&#39;t work for or have any interest
    in pushing FUD on behalf of carriers.  This is my own, genuine FUD.

  html: Also, the very existence of IPSEC CAC suggests risks for DoS attacks that
    the ACLs won&#39;t necessily protect against and can leverage encryption as part
    of the attack.

  html: I have a gut feeling that the cost mainly shift from the network (WAN) to
    the customer edge as the savings in circuit cost are to a large degree offset
    by the cost of security equipment. It depends on the use case, but in most instances
    using a WAN circuit makes business sense from a cost and from a performance (SLA)
    point of view. The cost of WAN circuits have come down quite a bit over the last
    decade while the cost of providing real security in a L3-L7 environment has skyrocketed.<br
    /><br />Please note that I do not work for a carrier and that for me security
    add-ons in routers and switches tend to be insufficent to provide real security.
