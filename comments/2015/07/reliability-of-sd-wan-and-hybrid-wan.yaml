  html: Hi Ivan, have you had any exposure to Barracuda&#39;s TINA protocol? Apparently,
    it runs on the NextGen FW, creates an overlay tunnel similar to some SD-WAN solutions

  html: As one of the people making comments on the original post, I&#39;d like to
    thank you for providing this update.<br /><br />Internet VPNs can&#39;t be ignored,
    and will prove to be at least part of the right solution for some Enterprises.  The
    cost difference is irresistible.<br /><br />But that also means it will attract
    a lot of folks looking to put &quot;I saved $$$&quot; on their resume and then
    move on before the disaster strikes.<br /><br />It would be really great to see
    a realistic business case analysis taking into account things like the additional
    cost of securing and monitoring Internet connections at hundreds or thousands
    of sites vs. maybe less than 10.  Or the cost of the Plan B for weathering enterprise-wide
    or near enterprise-wide Internet outages measured in days, where you&#39;re running
    on your backup solution (assuming it really was tested and works).  <br /><br

  html: 'What do you think is the value of being able to set *Application Performance*,
    in terms of Business Level Objectives, and let a solution such as SALSA by Ipanema
    Technologies ensure that the best path, priority, queue and other rules are all
    applied to guarantee your business runs smoothly in a hybrid networking environment? '
