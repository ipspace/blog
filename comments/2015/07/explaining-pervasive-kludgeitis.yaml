  html: IMO this is how kludges keep surviving.  A company consists of say 8 people.
    The company makes money by driving around in a bus.  Let&#39;s say they make $100USD
    for every km they drive.  The bus driver and co-pilot are usually in the later
    part of their careers and can see their retirement stop is 300km away.  At some
    point the other passengers notice the radiator making a hissing sound.  These
    passengers know that the best thing for long term health of the company is to
    stop and replace the radiator before the coolant leaks in to the transmission
    fluid and destroys the entire drivetrain.  They present the radiator replacement
    project to the driver and co-pilot.  The driver and co-pilot are content to ignore
    the problem and keep driving the bus hoping they reach their retirement stop 300km
    away before the bus fails.  Basically, the driver / co-pilot care more about their
    own well-being than that of the whole company.  They are happy to cash out and
    leave the passengers with a total jalopy.  In some companies that awkward 300km
    plays out over the course of many years.  It is rare to find organizations where
    the leaders truly put the overall health of the group above their own personal
    interest (see stock buyback schemes exploding in recent years.)
