It just transmits packets in software and they just get to the endpoint like the software has told them to. This could be RFC 1149 or 2549. It&#39;s software, see? It&#39;s not called HD-WAN. You don&#39;t need hardware, aka physical network. You just need a horned-pony API and a bash script to put all your curl commands. All you SDN haters need to wake up to the real world. And all you hardware vendors will be bankrupt. And also stop twisting cables, you are wasting time. ",
