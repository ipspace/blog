  html: 1.4Mpps mentioned in that article is far from what a Linux stack can actually
    deliver.<br /><br />Here is an article (Google Translate required) - where a guy
    describes how to make an app that can capture **9** Mpps.<br /><br />http://habrahabr.ru/post/261161/

  html: Overall I find this incoherent. You start off about an opinion of many, that
    switching from kernel to user space forwarding is necessary for good performance
    while your tone implies this isn&#39;t true. The link you post explains how to
    achieve good performance and you summarize this into three &quot;tricks&quot;.
    All involve using more than one core so we can conclude that the kernel stack
    scales well at least.<br /><br />You move on to an analysis of VM performance.
    Most don&#39;t achieve good performance as they make the mistake of relying on
    kernel calls and not &quot;optimising it&quot;. You mention that Juniper vMX is
    optimized. Since vMX is using DPDK and SR-IOV to achieve good performance I&#39;m
    not sure where we stand. Is the kernel good enough or not?<br /><br />What is
    the point of the article? If you don&#39;t want to reach a conclusion on one being
    better than the other I think you need to better explain the pros and cons of
    each respective solution. For example, DPDK won&#39;t help you much if you are
    trying to optimise your web server but if you are trying to build a virtual router
    or load balancer it probably is the tool for the job.<br /><br />Also, I find
    the topic of &quot;good performance&quot; to be an interesting one and really
    quite subjective. You mention 1Gbps being good enough for most but I don&#39;t
    that mean we can talk about it as &quot;good performance&quot; in absolute terms.
    Is the kernel performing well when you need 10 cores to achieve wire speed 10GE
    if you can do the same with Snabb switch on a single core?

  html: I&#39;m confused....  you are either forwarding your packets using the kernel&#39;s
    IP forwarding feature, or you are using something else.<br /><br />My understanding
    is that Vyatta  does the same as other distributions and just sets IPtables rules
    for any firewall restrictions, and relies on the kernel to do forwarding,<br /><br
    />And Juniper vMX doesn&#39;t do that.<br /><br />So you&#39;re saying you think
    Vyatta is optimized, and it&#39;s OK  to just use the kernel&#39;s IP forwarding
    features when implementing a firewall?<br /><br />Do you have any pointers then,  to
    how I would go about optimizing it,  if I wished to engineer a graphical firewall
    frontend based on a Linux kernel doing the packet forwarding,   since whatever
    Vyatta does is deemed good enough?<br /><br />I don&#39;t think Vyatta uses a
    modified Linux kernel,   so  If the kernel is doing all the forwarding;   I am
    wondering  literally what sort of things you think their optimization consists
    of.<br /><br />

    html: True - Unix (and consequently Linux) were designed for servers (or control
      plane processes). To get around this weakest link, you have to bypass Linux
      as much as possible - by downloading forwarding information into hardware (the
      Cumulus way) or doing packet processing in user-mode processes running on dedicated
      cores (the DPDK/PF_RING way).

  html: Regarding letter (D) weakest links....Linux OS was designed to operate end
    stations / servers, not traffic forwarding nodes like routers / switches.  Do
    you think this will be exposed soon as the &quot;weakest link&quot; in networking
    industry?

  html: The thing is, if I start with that same single-threaded 300kpps of 128B UDP
    on a Mellanox CX3 card, I get to 3.6Mpps just doing LD_PRELOAD=libvma.so.<br /><br
    />Mellanox engineers I&#39;ve spoken with claim this will scale to 37Mpps with
    multi-threaded senders.
