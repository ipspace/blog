The cost difference is irresistible.<br /><br />But that also means it will attract a lot of folks looking to put &quot;I saved $$$&quot; on their resume and then move on before the disaster strikes.<br /><br />It would be really great to see a realistic business case analysis taking into account things like the additional cost of securing and monitoring Internet connections at hundreds or thousands of sites vs. maybe less than 10.  Or the cost of the Plan B for weathering enterprise-wide or near enterprise-wide Internet outages measured in days, where you&#39;re running on your backup solution (assuming it really was tested and works).  <br /><br />",
