It covers partially the surrounding technologies that are linked. For example, Xen and VMware or ipv4 and ipv6, some knowledges are transposable and some are not. It&#39;s my point of view.",

It seems easy to research different technologies and begin to develop an understanding and some expertise.<br /><br />I worry that many products are so specialized that learning about them is mostly vendor-specific knowledge,  and it could be a waste of time.<br /><br />For example:  Nobody I work for is going to fork over the cash for a Palo Alto firewall,  so it seems like there is no point in attempting to add their product to my skillset,   unless the training material will cover a broader area in IT that is not product-specific.<br /><br />What is hard and confounding is how to pick which technologies, products, or principles are a productive and beneficial usage of time to actually spend time learning about.....<br /><br />Is there really anything obvious adjacent to   Redhat Linux, Windows Server/Exchange/MS SQL administration, vSphere ESXi admin/design,  JunOS/Datacenter Networking, PIX firewall administration,  Storage networking,  NFS/iSCSI/FC/FCoE,  SAN storage array Administration?<br /><br />",

On the other side, the theoretical learning will help you getting the basics to build a solid and trustfull knowledge on. As ever, a mix of both is the best.
