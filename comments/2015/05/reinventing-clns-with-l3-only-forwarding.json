          "html": "It __might__ work but (A) would require changes to host OS (which is a major showstopper in virtualized environments) and (B) would have severe performance limitations as opposed to doing the same L3 forwarding we always did with slightly modified control plane. I&#39;m not aware of any reasonably-priced box that could do PPPoE at terabit speeds (as opposed to 10K$ 10GE switches which can do L3 forwarding at those speeds).<br /><br />Finally, there&#39;s the MTU issue - familiar to anyone who had to implement TCP MSS clamping on a DSL router.",

          "html": "PPP is a bad solution, since it use a binary escaping from HDLC. This will result in making a constant bit rate workload into a variable bit rate transport. Bell Labs invented the generic framing procedure, that is an ITU standard (G.7041) and used in optical networks. This could replace all the various HDLC based framings and keep the characteristics of the bit rate. However, this requeries a hunting curcuit for fining the start of a frame, so it is not a good fit for software only implementations. ",

      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br />regarding this post and http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/04/rearchitecting-l3-only-networks.html<br /><br />what if one used pppoe on the end hosts?<br />It is probably supported everywhere (both on the OS and network side) and the router would need to redistribute the host connected on the other end.<br />If the host moves, ppp would timeout and the route would be removed.<br /><br />PS. I&#39;m not a ppp expert at all, so apologies if I am missing some important points that would not allow this to work!<br /><br />ciao<br />Gabriele",
