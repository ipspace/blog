On top of that, when you contact the vendor directly (I&#39;m being general here, not just Brocade), you usually have the first sales person pass it on to the second, maybe a third, because they&#39;re not sure themselves.<br />That takes time and gives a bad impression because a simple quote for a list of requirements can take weeks or more.<br />Vendors should really work on this. Customers can live with the fact that a certain functionality is not available (yet) or costs more. But being unclear just gets on everyone&#39;s nerves.",

The MLX code is more mature and marketing convincing people to pull out their MLX and replace them with VDX is bogus. <br />On a side note I upgraded NOS from 3.0.1 to 5.0.1c and my 6740 kept rebooting randomly during spikes. Not doing any layer3 just layer2 and it would crash!!!! <br /> Went down to 4.1.3b and is stable again. I would wait to upgrade to 6.0.",
