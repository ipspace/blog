  html: I wish VTPv3 was implemented on NXOS. For the typical DC, that would have
    solved the VLAN issue... ;)

  html: 'There is a difference between configuration based programmability, where
    config level constructs are being instantiated into the network element and thus
    influence the state, and state based programmability, where the actual state is
    being touched directly, bypassing the configuration constructs. For the former
    case, a programmatic API indeed is another form of CLI, and while it has its own
    benefits, it still depends and relies and is bound by the capabilities and procedures
    of the underying configuration components. While the latter approach allows for
    the flexibility to bypass the configuration completely and deal with the actual
    state directly. Here it becomes programmable in the direct sense of the word -
    the state is injected or modified by the programming entity, and configuration
    component of the element does not influence the process. Can this lead to potential
    conflicts? Certainly, it can and it does. It is just a powerful tool, and it certainly
    can be abused. However, even in such misuse scenario reverting back to sane state
    is less complex (just discard the programmed and derived state instead of trying
    to remove configuration fragments). '

    html: How about https://ripe71.ripe.net/archives/video/152/ ;)<br /><br />As for
      &quot;resource provisioning for non-network teams&quot;, look at numerous Neutron
      plugin implementations.<br /><br />Finally, totally agree that &quot;you need
      a solid foundation to build this on&quot;, but as usual the vendor marketers
      are telling everyone who&#39;s willing to listen that fairies and unicorns will
      make it work.

  html: Could someone give a concrete example of network programmability in action?
    I think it&#39;s always explained in a theoretical sense in way that it will cure
    all evils, but we don&#39;t see a concrete implementation. To me it sounds like
    scripting changes to allow network resource provisioning for non-network teams.
    It sounds good, but I think you will still have to have a solid foundation to
    build this on.

    html: Yes, this is definitely very doable in Python, and it might be even simpler
      if you&#39;d use Ansible.<br /><br />Alternatively, you could use Puppet or
      Chef on Nexus switches to get the job done.

  html: Hi Ivan, I am new to DevOps concept. in my small world, I would like to do
    things as below, using script if it&#39;s available<br /><br />1. run a script
    from Ubuntu or any Linux machine which opens up ssh session to my nexus 7k or
    5k switch. go to Ethernet1/10 and make it switchport access vlan 10, switchport
    mode access<br />2.  second script should do validation like &quot;show int eth1/10&quot;
    sh run int e1/10 and print the output to email group called noc@abc.com <br /><br
    />if I do this automation in my small world, I can skip waking up at 4 AM in morning
    every alternate day and have the script do its work. so that I can spend my time
    to other projects of my company.<br /><br />is this doable via python? my switches
    are running 5.1.0 or 5.2.0 IOS for 7k and 5k. I need to know python is compatible
    with that IOS ?<br />please provide me guidance for this<br /><br />Thanks<br
    />visio chambers
