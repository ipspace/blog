      "html": "There is a difference between configuration based programmability, where config level constructs are being instantiated into the network element and thus influence the state, and state based programmability, where the actual state is being touched directly, bypassing the configuration constructs. For the former case, a programmatic API indeed is another form of CLI, and while it has its own benefits, it still depends and relies and is bound by the capabilities and procedures of the underying configuration components. While the latter approach allows for the flexibility to bypass the configuration completely and deal with the actual state directly. Here it becomes programmable in the direct sense of the word - the state is injected or modified by the programming entity, and configuration component of the element does not influence the process. Can this lead to potential conflicts? Certainly, it can and it does. It is just a powerful tool, and it certainly can be abused. However, even in such misuse scenario reverting back to sane state is less complex (just discard the programmed and derived state instead of trying to remove configuration fragments). ",

I think it&#39;s always explained in a theoretical sense in way that it will cure all evils, but we don&#39;t see a concrete implementation. To me it sounds like scripting changes to allow network resource provisioning for non-network teams. It sounds good, but I think you will still have to have a solid foundation to build this on.",

I need to know python is compatible with that IOS ?<br />please provide me guidance for this<br /><br />Thanks<br />visio chambers",
