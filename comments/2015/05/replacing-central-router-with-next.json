I am working on a Network segmentation project which includes a NGFW in the data center but we will only be running IPS / IDS with Application Controls for security policy. At the Internet edge we will run full Service NGFW stack with Advanced threat / URL , etc. etc.  Our Info sec group has been quick to suggest a  Zone  for just about every server which essentially moves VLAN routeing to the firewall away from the cores. <br /><br />I am fighting this suggesting, 3 Zones with a &quot;small&quot; number of Zones within those Zones.  For example USER ZONE( Layer3 Switch includes MPLS routers for all User branch offices) routed connection to Data Center NGFW / DEV ZONE(L3 Switch ) routed  connection to Data Center NGFW / PRODUCTION ZONE( L3 Switch) routed connection to Data Center NGFW.<br />This would give us 3 Large Zones and the ability to write policy between any combination of them  - USER &lt;--&gt; DEV , DEV &lt;--&gt; PROD, PROD &lt;--&gt; USER.<br /><br />Servers deemed sensitive enough for their own smaller zones will all be dual homed with L2 backup network with Access to media servers. <br /><br /><br /> ",
