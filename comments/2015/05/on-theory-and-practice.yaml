  html: 'Theory and practice<br /><br />Theory is when you think you know something
    but it doesn&#39;t work.<br />Practice is when something works but you don&#39;t
    know why.<br />Usually we combine theory and practice: nothing works and we don&#39;t
    know why. '

  html: Answer would be as many interface on that router and if you create a loopback
    and assign them into a different area for fun ! then you can have thousands. But
    it doesn&#39;t mean you should of course :) Even in theory there is no numeric
    answer for &quot; what you should &quot; depends of topology,change rate , other
    control plane interactions , type of devices etc but , numeric answer would be
    estimated based on Router LSA size and desire to prevent fragmentation..
