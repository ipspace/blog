  html: The problems becom, when your clients don&#39;t support 802.1x (or big amount
    of them). Well, if it is not difficult, it is sure expensive...

  html: Well I think everyone should use 802.1X. I have deployed it at many sites
    and I call it the SDN of the campus! (I know some will slap me for it) <br /><br
    />The reason why I call it the SDN of the Campus, is that one of the things SDN
    gives you is automations and fast services enablement. <br /><br />And that is
    what 802.1X gives you in the Campus network. (Automation + Security)<br /><br
    />User/machines will be placed in the correct vlan based on some policies (authentication
    + status + etc)<br /><br />Devices that don&#39;t have an 802.1X supplicant can
    be profiled based on MAC address, but even more if you use the correct tools.
    So this shouldn&#39;t be a problem.<br /><br />You always read that 802.1X is
    difficult and complex, I don&#39;t agree. If you have a good network design your
    802.1X controller configuration can be very easy.<br /><br />The most important
    thing that is forgotten most of the time is that most advanced features are a
    combination of switch features and controller features.<br /><br /><br />

    html: Here&#39;s the basic description of how one would implement a control-plane
      protocol with OpenFlow:<br /><br />http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/06/implementing-control-plane-protocols.html<br
      /><br />You&#39;d have to find an open-source 801.2x authenticator and integrate
      it with pox. Good luck!

  html: 'Hello,<br /><br />I&#39;m university study and I&#39;m doing my final project.
    I would like implement EAP-TLS on pox controler to autenticate my clients with
    digital certificate. I would like to use a FREERADIUS to autenticate the users.  What
    can I do to implement 802.1x on pox controler on mininet for it to works with
    OpenFlow?<br /><br />Thanks a lot for your help, '
