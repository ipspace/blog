    html: Yes, the core transport would work properly (or at least IPv4 and IPv6 would
      break at the same time ;)... unless of course you&#39;re running IPv4 natively
      and IPv6 over MPLS, in which case you already treat them differently.

  html: Kind of....a dumb question.<br /><br />When one has dual stack at the edge,
    and 6PE in the core, wouldn&#39;t that essentially help keep the stacks working
    properly as long as one can still have labeled routes resolving and pushing traffic?
