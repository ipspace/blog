  html: 'So true and to add<br />1), Many of the the switches even from the late 90s,
    00s and last 5 yeas have a ton of features built in(beyond R/S) but are never
    used. Remember CMS on Cisco switches?(if you were a small shop yoiu had a built
    in secure NMS right there from a GUI to manage your network and even push policy/configs)
    You had Interface Macros/profiles etc all these &quot;programmable&quot; extras
    just sitting there for box by box use or centralized use if someone spent the
    time with an NMS system to utilize these features. <br /><br />2). Then there
    was the issue at one point in the last 20 years that most shops didn&#39;t want
    that &quot;plug and play&quot; switch? Why? Our old friend STP or any routing
    protocol, if all L3. Clients got burned early on with the PnP switch approach
    causing some convergence related outage so now out of policy and possibly security
    anything getting connected to the network still must be scrubbed/provisioned not
    &quot;discovered&quot; prior being added. Maybe just a mindset now but we should
    be past that these days as you pointed out. <br /><br />Big Switch Networks does
    some of that and I know there will be different uses of LLDP for this or any protocol
    with TLV to add a little extra to the sauce for discovery auto configure purposes. '

  html: Why would the vendors invest in simplifying configuration and deployment when
    there hasn&#39;t been any demand for it from the network engineering community?
    <br /><br />We - network engineers - are notorious for favoring deliberate complexity;
    foolishly believing that it gives us job security.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Juniper has supported unnumbered P2P ethernet links with
    OSPF for about 10 years now.<br /><br />Have you seen Junos Fusion? It&#39;s based
    on IEEE 802.1BR and has all of the automation and plug-and-play functionality
    you want.

  html: 'Interesting article, I completely agree with you regarding all sorts of automation
    that are not yet deployed but definitely they should. But I have a slightly different
    perspective regarding &quot;crazy stuff like SDN, APIs, Puppet/Chef&quot;: in
    fact that&#39;s the point - instead of buiilding a very expensive box with all
    features that you might or might not need for your business, buy a cheap one and
    do whatever you want for your internal purpose. In my humble opinion, the final
    goal is to spread the incomings of big vendors like Cisco (which doesn&#39;t completely
    agree with the ideas of openness and cheap) to others that provide different solutions.'

  html: Well, people need to be careful what they ask for, since it could materialize...<br
    /><br />L3 is not the universal answer for everything, and properly engineered
    L2 could perform much better in many situations.<br /><br />Let&#39;s take the
    example of TRILL - internally, it does IP-like routing of packets via shortest
    paths, so it performs all required L3 functionalities behind the scenes. At the
    same time, it can autoconfigure nicknames (2-byte &quot;IP addresses&quot;), so
    addition of a new switch is no problem. And it doesn&#39;t need to care about
    LACP, since it can natively load-balance over multiple equal-cost paths.<br /><br
    />As you said - if you push all the complexities onto the network edge, it&#39;s
    totally irrelevant, what protocol the core clos fabric runs - as long as it responsively
    moves packets over the shortest paths. And the only difference between TRILL and
    IP is, that TRILL uses 2-byte nicknames, while IP uses 4-byte IPv4 or 16-byte
    IPv6 addresses. Routing protocol (IS-IS) is the same.<br />

    html: I agree with you (as always - this is getting boring ;).<br /><br />However,
      why should I do IP address management on intra-fabric links if I don&#39;t have
      to. Also, keep in mind that you&#39;re years ahead of everyone else. Not many
      people consider their network devices lego blocks that they&#39;ll use in their
      DIY solution; many enterprise customers bark at &quot;some assembly required&quot;
      idea.

  html: Everything boils down to standarization. If you can standarize your deployment,
    you can template it and, if you can template, you don&#39;t care if your vendor
    support unnumbered interfaces or not or if your base configuration requires 100
    lines or 1000 lines.<br /><br />And for the LLDP example that you mentioned, you
    can easily mimic that behavior yourself with ZTP in EOS (EOS supports loading
    a python script instead of a configuration file during the ZTP process).

  html: Alcatel Lucent Enterprise has an auto-configuration feature which can detect
    linkagg, spb network and access ports, routing adjacencies etc.

  html: Mmmmm, thats a bit narrow minded, no offense.<br /><br />Vendors do what customers
    demand, they have a long list of things to do and they make decisions to prioritize
    based on rational business reasons, its not a conspiracy. <br /><br />Programmability
    and automation additions are all ways to get this done. Take a chhll pill.<br
    /><br />Rant is easy.

  html: I would also add that Doug Hanks and Juniper are making a lot of this a reality
    with OpenCLOS and ZTP. Good stuff
