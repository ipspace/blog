      "html": "Well I think everyone should use 802.1X. I have deployed it at many sites and I call it the SDN of the campus! (I know some will slap me for it) <br /><br />The reason why I call it the SDN of the Campus, is that one of the things SDN gives you is automations and fast services enablement. <br /><br />And that is what 802.1X gives you in the Campus network. (Automation + Security)<br /><br />User/machines will be placed in the correct vlan based on some policies (authentication + status + etc)<br /><br />Devices that don&#39;t have an 802.1X supplicant can be profiled based on MAC address, but even more if you use the correct tools. So this shouldn&#39;t be a problem.<br /><br />You always read that 802.1X is difficult and complex, I don&#39;t agree. If you have a good network design your 802.1X controller configuration can be very easy.<br /><br />The most important thing that is forgotten most of the time is that most advanced features are a combination of switch features and controller features.<br /><br /><br />",
