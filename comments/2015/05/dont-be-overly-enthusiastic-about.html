            <div class="comment-content">Very stressful. On top of that, when you contact the vendor directly (I&#39;m being general here, not just Brocade), you usually have the first sales person pass it on to the second, maybe a third, because they&#39;re not sure themselves.<br />That takes time and gives a bad impression because a simple quote for a list of requirements can take weeks or more.<br />Vendors should really work on this. Customers can live with the fact that a certain functionality is not available (yet) or costs more. But being unclear just gets on everyone&#39;s nerves.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;ve seen companies pull out perfectly good network running MLXs because of marketing / sales bluff convinced them to upgrade to VDX (imo downgrade). The MLX code is more mature and marketing convincing people to pull out their MLX and replace them with VDX is bogus. <br />On a side note I upgraded NOS from 3.0.1 to 5.0.1c and my 6740 kept rebooting randomly during spikes. Not doing any layer3 just layer2 and it would crash!!!! <br /> Went down to 4.1.3b and is stable again. I would wait to upgrade to 6.0.</div>
