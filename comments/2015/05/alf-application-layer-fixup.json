          "html": "I remember a similar issue with the server-side email filtering language SIEVE: in its early days, it used 2000/tcp by default, but later did move to 4190/tcp. 2000/tcp is still in use by legacy configurations, but later became assigned to Cisco&#39;s Skinny protocol. As a result, an ASA in place may accept the connection (client thinks &quot;server accepts the tcp connection), the ASA doesn&#39;t read skinny protocol packets and hence closes the connection (clients thinks &quot;server closed connection&quot;). Of course, the SIEVE server doesn&#39;t ever see an incoming connection from that client - and so one can easily spend days debugging this.",

      "html": "My one experience with &#39;fix&#39;ups was on a Cisco ASA doing remote user vpn..  When I installed it I never disabled the default inspection stuff (What harm could they do?).<br /><br />Much later, after what should have been an uneventful update on some windows servers, no one could access email (MAPI) over the vpn.  Turns out the update changed a default rpc port or something causing the ASA to think the traffic was malformed skinny packets, and drop it.<br /><br />",
