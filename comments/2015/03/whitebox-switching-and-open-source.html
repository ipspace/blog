            <div class="comment-content">I like this point especially.<br /><br />&quot;On the other hand, the real beauty of Linux-based network operating systems (Cumulus Linux, Arista EOS and to a smaller extent Junos) is the ability to take any one of the zillion off-the-shelf packages and install it on your switch.&quot; <br /><br />Novell NLM anyone? <br /><br />or <br />What about the certification of approved &quot;packages&quot; to install on your shining open source switch that is supporting a critical application.<br /><br />Believe it or not sometimes the proprietary can be more secure.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Depending on how you read the ONF definition for SDN - https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/sdn-definition, one could extract some the items listed and claim this is SDN although the definition is for an &#39;SDN architecture&#39;. I think the following statement is the closest to what we are actually seeing: &quot;Cumulus NOS contributes to some aspects of an SDN architecture&quot; and I would add an architecture is not built around a single product especially for SDN.<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan, your post is perfect example of interpretation :-)<br />I could do the same and argue that &quot;SDN architecture is:&quot; somehow defines what an SDN architecture is supposed to be based around. <br /><br />Anyway, it&#39;s your blog and your way of &quot;discussing&quot; things by being a critic, nothing wrong here, just the Internet attitude I suppose.<br /><br />Carry on as we need the hype to be addressed.<br /><br />I, therefore, make you knight of SDN (although it does not make me king of SDN...maybe this needs to get full approval from his holiness Martin Casado)<br /><br />Long live SDN ! Long live Rocket turtle !</div>

            <div class="comment-content">@Anonymous:Now that&#39;s classic stupid, everyone has some cisco or other incumbent box including Google. I talk to customers on a daily basis there is nothing wrong with l2/l3 based networks with good NMS, they just want to invest and keep the software that they have learnt to maintain and swap out the underlying hardware when the time comes for refresh. ONF and its definition of SDN does not mean squat in the real world ruled by OpEx and CapEx savings. Technology can do all tricks but what matters is the cost of the ticket ! </div>

            <div class="comment-content">We have been working on an interesting SDN open source project http://www.openmul.org/prism-sdn-router.html. We are trying to build a scale-out SDN solution with multiple data plane and single control plane abstraction. Once we are able to solve exporting legacy switch tables to controller using Openflow, this will give a real run for the money for these so called fake SDN solutions.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan, I agree with many of your points, but I think your conclusion &quot;open-source networking and software-hardware disaggregation have nothing to do with network automation or software-defined networks&quot; misses an important point.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/2894263/sdn/big-switch-networks-cto-rob-sherwood-on-sdn-in-2015-the-time-is-now.html" rel="nofollow">Art Fewell&#39;s  recent interview with Rob Sherwood</a> has an interesting exchange in which Rob states, &quot;I think OpenFlow is very valuable but it&#39;s also, it&#39;s a technical solution to a business problem that we&#39;ve had. This is to say, if you flashed back 7, 8 years when I started working on this; the idea that you could actually buy a switch and put your own software on it and there was enough hardware documentation and enough open source software to make that happen, it was actually, it just wasn&#39;t even on the table. The next best thing that we could hope for was a remote API into the low level forwarding plane on the box. That was how the OpenFlow was designed. Fast forward to today, we have things like, if I could put a small plug-in for my open source project, Open Network Linux. You can grab something like that and either deploy our OpenFlow, or write your own OpenFlow, or write something else.&quot;<br /><br />You <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/09/the-four-paths-to-sdn.html" rel="nofollow">Four Paths to SDN</a> article listed &quot;Vendor-specific APIs&quot; as one of the paths to SDN, but raised the objection that relying on a vendor specific API results in vendor lock in. Moving to Linux APIs to interface with network hardware avoid vendor lock in and allows operators to benefit from the Linux ecosystem of &quot;zillion off-the-shelf packages&quot; and as the ecosystem expands, hopefully zillions more. The Linux netlink API provides a good abstraction for interfacing with routing which is used by open source distributed routing agents like Quagga or Bird, or if you want a standardized remote API, you could use something like <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3549.txt" rel="nofollow">IETF Forces protocol</a>.<br /><br />Open networking hardware and Linux is moving SDN from being primarily concerned about protocols (which are required to communicate with closed systems) to APIs and software which seems to me the essence of software defined networking.</div>
