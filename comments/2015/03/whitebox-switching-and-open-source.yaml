  html: I like this point especially.<br /><br />&quot;On the other hand, the real
    beauty of Linux-based network operating systems (Cumulus Linux, Arista EOS and
    to a smaller extent Junos) is the ability to take any one of the zillion off-the-shelf
    packages and install it on your switch.&quot; <br /><br />Novell NLM anyone? <br
    /><br />or <br />What about the certification of approved &quot;packages&quot;
    to install on your shining open source switch that is supporting a critical application.<br
    /><br />Believe it or not sometimes the proprietary can be more secure.

    html: What Vignesh wrote is wrong and stupid.  SDN is marketing term.  Cumulus
      is a network operating system.  You can call it what you want but the inventors
      of &quot;SDN&quot; were actually focused on network virtualization and not all
      of this other stuff.

    html: 'Depending on how you read the ONF definition for SDN - https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/sdn-definition,
      one could extract some the items listed and claim this is SDN although the definition
      is for an &#39;SDN architecture&#39;. I think the following statement is the
      closest to what we are actually seeing: &quot;Cumulus NOS contributes to some
      aspects of an SDN architecture&quot; and I would add an architecture is not
      built around a single product especially for SDN.<br />'

    html: The ONF definition of SDN is very clear (and useless) - read the first paragraph
      on the page you quoted (under the &quot;What is SDN&quot; heading).<br /><br
      />After that they tout the supposed beauties of their architecture, not list
      the criteria you could use to figure out whether something is SDN or not.

    html: Ivan, your post is perfect example of interpretation :-)<br />I could do
      the same and argue that &quot;SDN architecture is:&quot; somehow defines what
      an SDN architecture is supposed to be based around. <br /><br />Anyway, it&#39;s
      your blog and your way of &quot;discussing&quot; things by being a critic, nothing
      wrong here, just the Internet attitude I suppose.<br /><br />Carry on as we
      need the hype to be addressed.<br /><br />I, therefore, make you knight of SDN
      (although it does not make me king of SDN...maybe this needs to get full approval
      from his holiness Martin Casado)<br /><br />Long live SDN ! Long live Rocket
      turtle !

      but it&#39;s obviously impossible to make any conclusions in an anonymous conversation
      (&quot;just the Internet attitude&quot; as you say).

    html: Don&#39;t we quote Facebook and Google as example of SDN. They do develop
      their software and buy white-box hardware. This as a definition of SDN one could
      argue as wrong but definitely not stupid especially from a business model standpoint.

    html: '@Anonymous:Now that&#39;s classic stupid, everyone has some cisco or other
      incumbent box including Google. I talk to customers on a daily basis there is
      nothing wrong with l2/l3 based networks with good NMS, they just want to invest
      and keep the software that they have learnt to maintain and swap out the underlying
      hardware when the time comes for refresh. ONF and its definition of SDN does
      not mean squat in the real world ruled by OpEx and CapEx savings. Technology
      can do all tricks but what matters is the cost of the ticket ! '

  html: SDN is a business model of not buying HW and SW from same vendor. Underneath
    this definition Cumulus would still qualify as SDN.

  html: We have been working on an interesting SDN open source project http://www.openmul.org/prism-sdn-router.html.
    We are trying to build a scale-out SDN solution with multiple data plane and single
    control plane abstraction. Once we are able to solve exporting legacy switch tables
    to controller using Openflow, this will give a real run for the money for these
    so called fake SDN solutions.

  html: Anonymous comments are a way for people to say things they are not so sure
    of because there is no blame or risk of getting exposed, so its really useless.
    <br /><br />Ivan, If i were you, I would disable Anonymous comments because they
    are rarely important and are always considered &quot;internet attitude&quot; of
    trolling.

  html: Ivan, I agree with many of your points, but I think your conclusion &quot;open-source
    networking and software-hardware disaggregation have nothing to do with network
    automation or software-defined networks&quot; misses an important point.<br /><br
    /><a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/2894263/sdn/big-switch-networks-cto-rob-sherwood-on-sdn-in-2015-the-time-is-now.html"
    rel="nofollow">Art Fewell&#39;s  recent interview with Rob Sherwood</a> has an
    interesting exchange in which Rob states, &quot;I think OpenFlow is very valuable
    but it&#39;s also, it&#39;s a technical solution to a business problem that we&#39;ve
    had. This is to say, if you flashed back 7, 8 years when I started working on
    this; the idea that you could actually buy a switch and put your own software
    on it and there was enough hardware documentation and enough open source software
    to make that happen, it was actually, it just wasn&#39;t even on the table. The
    next best thing that we could hope for was a remote API into the low level forwarding
    plane on the box. That was how the OpenFlow was designed. Fast forward to today,
    we have things like, if I could put a small plug-in for my open source project,
    Open Network Linux. You can grab something like that and either deploy our OpenFlow,
    or write your own OpenFlow, or write something else.&quot;<br /><br />You <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/09/the-four-paths-to-sdn.html"
    rel="nofollow">Four Paths to SDN</a> article listed &quot;Vendor-specific APIs&quot;
    as one of the paths to SDN, but raised the objection that relying on a vendor
    specific API results in vendor lock in. Moving to Linux APIs to interface with
    network hardware avoid vendor lock in and allows operators to benefit from the
    Linux ecosystem of &quot;zillion off-the-shelf packages&quot; and as the ecosystem
    expands, hopefully zillions more. The Linux netlink API provides a good abstraction
    for interfacing with routing which is used by open source distributed routing
    agents like Quagga or Bird, or if you want a standardized remote API, you could
    use something like <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3549.txt" rel="nofollow">IETF
    Forces protocol</a>.<br /><br />Open networking hardware and Linux is moving SDN
    from being primarily concerned about protocols (which are required to communicate
    with closed systems) to APIs and software which seems to me the essence of software
    defined networking.
