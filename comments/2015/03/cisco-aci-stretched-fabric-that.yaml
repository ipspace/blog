  html: 'I completely share your enthusiasm about Cisco&#39;s ACI. I would add that
    it revolutionized the SDN technology, with -but not limited to - its group-based
    policy contribution. This GBP is currently being incorporated into 2 major open-source
    projects - OpenStack &amp; OpenDaylight.<br />You&#39;ll probably be interested
    by the Lippis report about ACI: http://lippisreport.com/2015/03/lippis-report-223-an-open-approach-to-network-automation/'

    html: Are you sure?   I thought it was precisely the opposite.<br /><br />The
      QFX5100 uses just the Trident II -- which is &quot;known&quot; (for varying
      values of &quot;known&quot;) to NOT support VXLAN routing. The N9K leverages
      both the Trident II, as well as custom Cisco silicon -- the latter being specifically
      able to handle VXLAN routing.

    html: Hi Phil,<br />That VXLAN routing leaf stick is required in standalone(nxos)
      mode if you are runing older nxos code. However, with new VXLAN-EVPN/Anycast-GW
      feature in code 7, you don&#39;t need that stick any more.

  html: 'One of the issues with ACI and the current crop of Nexus 9K TOR switches
    is they cannot do &quot;routed VXLAN&quot; where there are models from other vendors
    like the Juniper QFX5100 that do.  So any kind of inter-VXLAN traffic in the current
    ACI infrastructure needs to be punted to a GW on a stick setup, which is less
    than optimal.   If your inter-VXLAN GW exists in another datacenter, it could
    be very messy.   <br /><br />Unless I&#39;m misunderstanding the current limitations,
    but the designs I&#39;ve seen always show another device on a stick acting as
    a way to route between VXLANs.  '

    html: Help me figure out in what context that was. BTW, it seems ACI is not doing
      proxy ARP, I was told they&#39;re transforming broadcast ARP into unicast ARP.

    html: That is correct - turns into a unicast on the ACI fabric since all endpoints&#39;
      locations are known; therefore no need to flood in the fabric.

  html: With the recent implementation of BGP EVPN VXLAN control plane (http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-9000-series-switches/white-paper-c11-733737.html?_ga=1.45902372.1882588252.1422623251):<br
    />- the VM MAC/IP addresses are distributed in the fabric (and even inter-fabric),
    meaning that all leaf switches can proxy ARP<br />- the VM mobility is transparently
    supported<br />- now, &quot;Nexus 9300 switches with the ALE ASIC offer the capability
    to route VXLAN overlay traffic at the leaf, unlike traditional Broadcom Trident
    II based platforms, which cannot VXLAN route the packet&quot;.<br />

    html: Forgive my ignorance but what would be the benefit in using EVPN in ACI
      mode? Don&#39;t you get the basic control and data-plane structure of ACI by
      using EVPN instead anyway (in NX-OS mode)

    EVPN in Q4<br /><br />BTW up until now we really like ACI.<br /><br />I just setup
    our second ACI pod.
