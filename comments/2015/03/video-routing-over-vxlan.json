      "html": "Ivan, <br /><br />The problem referred in the video is because of routing done at dest VTEP. If the solution is architect-ed such a way that routing is done at source VTEP and bridging at dest VTEP then we may not hit the problem at all. We may have to deal with different problem (ARP scaling).",
