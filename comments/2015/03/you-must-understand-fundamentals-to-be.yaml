  html: I agree with you, I think for being a good engineer or any other profession,
    you have to have a strong foundation and solid learning.

    html: I have yet to see an SDN system that would be less complex than well-designed
      traditional IP routing. Do I need to say more?

    html: I think the idea is to deploy faster, not to debug/troubleshoot easier.
      Having a way to tap into the network at any spot via a controller is nice, but
      it doesn&#39;t solve all issues. At some point there will probably be a bunch
      of third-party and/or native tools to make things easier, but visibility into
      the forwarding (which seems to be the selling point of SDN solutions in terms
      of troubleshooting) is not be-all end-all of troubleshooting solutions.

    html: I agree, SDN and NFV are being primarily driven by businesses faster time
      to market and CAPEX reduction requirements. I&#39;m willing to bet no consideration
      was given to network management, operational complexity and its impact on support
      costs and customer experience.<br /><br />SDN is also a vague term that seems
      to encompass all areas of networking. It would be more valuable if the problem
      was decomposed into different areas for example SDN for data centre, for campus
      and for WAN or break it up into Edge vs Core SDN. In my opinion these areas
      would have significantly different solutions.

  html: Agree completely. But is not main purpose of SDN is to to make debugging &amp;
    troubleshooting easy from centralized location ?. If one needs large set of high
    quality network engineers then why would one choose complex SDN deployments at
    all ?

    html: This is the fundamental issue with all these lovely abstraction tools I
      have seen - the end result of simplicity for the service consumer can be present
      but at the expense of immense complexity on the provider side.  <br />As Ivan
      says these marketing VPs are blind to this, yes we might need fewer level 1
      folk to provision services but the level 2 &amp; 3 people need to be more skilled
      / expensive than before.

  html: It&#39;s all about the protocols, know your protocols and you will be solid.<br
    /><br />Nope Ivan you need not say any more. Spot on.  Just reading the Cisco
    Press &quot;The Policy Driven Data Center with ACI&quot; and to be frank on first
    purse what a mess. <br /><br />Forget about the HW ASIC+ on the 9k and all the
    juggling between the NFE, ALE, ASE and Buffer boost, odd over subscription and
    a recast version of what sounds like WFQ, plus your previous ACI posts.  Look
    at how this is all orchestrated and controlled between the APN profiles, Tenants
    and EPGs, subjects, contracts, lables, bundles special multicast EPGs and all
    the rest of the Progresso soup and you wonder WT@#%$%^ were they thinking.  I
    think in one of your older posts you called it spaghetti ;)  See chapter 3 The
    Policy Data Center and chapter 4 Operational Model and you will see what I am
    talking about.   I do get it and it makes sense but you think they could have
    come up with a better approach/system to simplify.<br /><br />Regards...

    html: That&#39;s why in most telcos there are different operational groups for
      initial deployment and ongoing maintenance and support. If you are going to
      deploy SDN without a proper SDLC, then best of luck.

  html: Great post Ivan. The design and deployment is getting more complex with additional
    integration points in the SDN world (virtual machine managers, orchestration,
    automation tools etc.). While automation has the potential to reduce the number
    of network engineers during the run/operate phase,  when things go wrong (and
    they often do), you will need a specialist with sound fundamentals to fix the
    problem. All this means network engineers need deeper as well as wider skills
    to survive the  brave new world.

    html: It depends on where you are in your IT automation journey.<br /><br />If
      you&#39;re still deploying everything by hand, and hand-crafting VMs from ISO
      images, then DCIM is the way to go. It gives you a somewhat consistent view
      of your data center, and you can deploy something like a VLAN across multiple
      boxes without ever logging into one.<br /><br />If however your server/application
      people got further along on their path toward DevOps, they might start getting
      annoyed that they can deploy a VM in 5 seconds, but it still takes dozens of
      GUI clicks to get a new VLAN deployed. In those environments the need to program
      networking devices becomes pretty urgent.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />Ivan

  html: I just went through some Cisco webinar, I believe it was on VIRL and they
    were showcasing the use of the API and python to add a vlan. I do some Python
    myself and have used the NXOS api for some simple devops menu like use. But for
    the most part if you are an enterprise and have Prime DCIM to use to add vlans
    for example why go through the coding process. It was a bad example IMHO.
