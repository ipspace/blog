      "html": "Definitely it depends on this one... Also, I assume we are discussing outbound traffic as inbound traffic would be very difficult to measure, depending on how far from our AS we could consider the network as converged.<br /><br />The first step is to detect the failure. Design for Loss of Signal (LoS), so don&#39;t use any converters, MUXes that do stupid things etc. Ask the provider to run BFD.<br /><br />I&#39;m assuming that under normal circumstances, the secondary router would have the iBGP routes with a higher local pref but the eBGP routes already in the BGP table. So when Upstream A fails, the primary router would only have to send Withdraw message and the secondary router would start to use the external routes. The secondary router would then have to send those routes to the primary router through iBGP.<br /><br />So some time could be shaved off the convergence if the secondary router attracts all the traffic instead of traffic going to the primary router and then across the iBGP peering. Not knowing what the network looks like, this could be achieved by modifying HSRP priority based on some tracking of an interface or route, conditionally advertising a default route and so on.<br /><br />BGP PIC and Best external would definitely be helpful though if supported on the platform.",

Exabgp can handle advertising a full table fairly easily, whether you get it directly from a live network or build a config with 500K paths in it.    We still use a full mesh, with 57 routers, and each router sees approximately 3M unicast paths, with 500K+ best paths after it&#39;s all said and done.  I simulate all 57 routers in exabgp and use linux TC to simulate the latency between the peers.  <br /><br />You can imagine on cold boot there is a lot of churn going on as best paths are replaced with better paths, forwarding tables have to be updated, etc.  However with modern CPUs convergence is still under 2 minutes once everything comes up  <br /><br />With a RR in the middle and having just a single neighbor advertising the best 520K odd paths, the convergence is 10-15 seconds.
