  html: '@Frank<br /><br />http://www.inside-it.ch acted as publisher and sold some
    ad space to cover cost. Inside-IT has a strict Code of Ethics, including a Chinese
    wall. None of the adverstisers saw the publication before it was made available
    to the general public. You might have noticed, that not a single vendor is named
    in the entire document and thus no indirect marketing is involved. <br /><br />Providing
    the document for free to the general public was made possible through the ads.
    The number of ads is limited and the placement is in a way, that does not interefere
    with the reader&#39;s flow. The ads did not have any influence on the content,
    though. No payments were made by the advertisers to me. <br /><br />By providing
    important evaluation criteria, the document actually might not be in the interest
    of the sales departments of the advertisers,as the less a customer knows, the
    easier the sale. The document is rather to the benefit of the (non-paying) reader
    and potential buyer.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I had been contracted by Inside-IT'
