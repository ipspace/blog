  html: Parts of the ISP I work for do use automation for provisioning (DSLAMs and
    BRAS boxes - thousands of them). The problem I see arising from this is two part.
    1. The OSS they use is most common reason for delays as it keeps failing for no
    apparent reasons. 2. when it fails, guys almost lost the proficiency with CLI
    to do the troubleshooting and/or correcting of the issues. <br /><br />That is
    my 2p worth of thought on this subject.<br /><br />
