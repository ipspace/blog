    html: Arista supports VXLAN routing on the 7150 switch, which is based on Intel
      FM6000 chipset. Obviously FM6000 doesn&#39;t have the same hardware limitations
      as other more popular chipsets.

    html: 'The second part is easy: http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/02/performance-of-hypervisor-based-overlay.html<br
      /><br />I have no opinion on Geneve (the encapsulation), apart from &quot;why
      do we need yet another encapsulation?&quot; Once I see a real-life use case
      I might start forming one.<br /><br />Kind regards...'

  html: Excellent Video. All of your sessions should have those animations very good
    to visualize the process. I like the Cisco &quot;purpose built&quot; solution.
    Where is my whitebox;)<br /><br />Any thought or future posts considering the
    following:<br />Geneve<br />https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gross-geneve-00<br
    />http://blogs.vmware.com/cto/geneve-vxlan-network-virtualization-encapsulation<br
    /><br />And utilizing any of the options of an Intel XL710 10/40 gigabit Ethernet
    chipset?<br /><br />Regards..<br /><br />

    html: Absolutely true... as I explained in the first blog post linked to from
      this one ;)<br /><br />And yeah, ARP scaling will eventually kill you if you
      use distributed routing approach in large deployments.

  html: Ivan, <br /><br />The problem referred in the video is because of routing
    done at dest VTEP. If the solution is architect-ed such a way that routing is
    done at source VTEP and bridging at dest VTEP then we may not hit the problem
    at all. We may have to deal with different problem (ARP scaling).
