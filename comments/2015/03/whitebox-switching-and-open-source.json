This is to say, if you flashed back 7, 8 years when I started working on this; the idea that you could actually buy a switch and put your own software on it and there was enough hardware documentation and enough open source software to make that happen, it was actually, it just wasn&#39;t even on the table. The next best thing that we could hope for was a remote API into the low level forwarding plane on the box. That was how the OpenFlow was designed. Fast forward to today, we have things like, if I could put a small plug-in for my open source project, Open Network Linux. You can grab something like that and either deploy our OpenFlow, or write your own OpenFlow, or write something else.&quot;<br /><br />You <a href=\"http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/09/the-four-paths-to-sdn.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Four Paths to SDN</a> article listed &quot;Vendor-specific APIs&quot; as one of the paths to SDN, but raised the objection that relying on a vendor specific API results in vendor lock in. Moving to Linux APIs to interface with network hardware avoid vendor lock in and allows operators to benefit from the Linux ecosystem of &quot;zillion off-the-shelf packages&quot; and as the ecosystem expands, hopefully zillions more. The Linux netlink API provides a good abstraction for interfacing with routing which is used by open source distributed routing agents like Quagga or Bird, or if you want a standardized remote API, you could use something like <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3549.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">IETF Forces protocol</a>.<br /><br />Open networking hardware and Linux is moving SDN from being primarily concerned about protocols (which are required to communicate with closed systems) to APIs and software which seems to me the essence of software defined networking.",
