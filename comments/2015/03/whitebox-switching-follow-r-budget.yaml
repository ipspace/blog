    html: It&#39;s their entire business. I was not able to find relevant numbers
      per market segment.

    html: 'And that makes your conclusion somewhat of a leap - the dollars Dell do
      spend on R&amp;D may be disproportionately on storage and networking.  Likewise
      a bunch of Cisco&#39;s greater spend will be on voice/conferencing/servers etc.  '

    html: Simon, I think you&#39;re right, however the most probable assumption would
      be that HP and DELL are also spreading their R&amp;D costs among different products.
      And the difference isn&#39;t even 5% (which is already a lot) but rather 17-19%.
      Doubt that the point of this analysis was to provide some hard proof, but approximation
      looks interesting  and even &quot;explains&quot; how Arista is keeping up with
      a game<br />Just my 2c

    html: '@Simon: You&#39;re absolutely right, but I wasn&#39;t able to find per-product
      line numbers. Cisco is reporting sales per product segment, but not the associated
      expenses, and most other companies aren&#39;t even that forthcoming. This back-of-the-napkin
      calculation was thus the best I could do, and as Anonymous pointed out, most
      companies would have to do R&amp;D in most product categories they carry.<br
      /><br />Also, the difference is significant - Cisco (without acquisitions) is
      spending twice as much on R&amp;D as HP with less than half their sales volume.'

  html: I&#39;m curious if your Dell and HP Sales and R&amp;D numbers cover their
    entire business or just their networking offerings.

  html: 'HP has traditionally spent about 2.5-3% of their revenue on R&amp;D, you
    can look at more data here:  <br /><br />http://www.zdnet.com/article/hps-r-d-spending-back-to-2008-levels/<br
    /><br />It&#39;s considered low compared to a lot of other tech companies, but
    again it&#39;s hard to say what that means.  They make a bit deal about spending
    $3B/year on R&amp;D.   They are doing a lot of R&amp;D in the area of silicon
    photonics which will play an increasingly important role in networking.  '
