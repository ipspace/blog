      "html": "For the dual stack edge / dmz deployments I have done in the past, everything is hard coded, the addresses, even custom Link Locals for location id,  turn off RD, use the flow label as a tag per zone for integrity and apply some policers when we get some erratic v6 numbers. From the address we know who is who, zone, and who doesn&#39;t belong between all zones.   Kind of like a custom LAA job.  Interesting on the MLD issues on larger enterprise side. I recall the issue but haven&#39;t been involved in any enterprise dual stack or green field deployments where the numbers are big enough to cause an issue. Great post for an update on the issue and the link to Occasionally Coherent blog about this.",
