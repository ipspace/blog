            <div class="comment-content">@Frank<br /><br />http://www.inside-it.ch acted as publisher and sold some ad space to cover cost. Inside-IT has a strict Code of Ethics, including a Chinese wall. None of the adverstisers saw the publication before it was made available to the general public. You might have noticed, that not a single vendor is named in the entire document and thus no indirect marketing is involved. <br /><br />Providing the document for free to the general public was made possible through the ads. The number of ads is limited and the placement is in a way, that does not interefere with the reader&#39;s flow. The ads did not have any influence on the content, though. No payments were made by the advertisers to me. <br /><br />By providing important evaluation criteria, the document actually might not be in the interest of the sales departments of the advertisers,as the less a customer knows, the easier the sale. The document is rather to the benefit of the (non-paying) reader and potential buyer.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I had been contracted by Inside-IT</div>
