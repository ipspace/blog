Having a way to tap into the network at any spot via a controller is nice, but it doesn&#39;t solve all issues. At some point there will probably be a bunch of third-party and/or native tools to make things easier, but visibility into the forwarding (which seems to be the selling point of SDN solutions in terms of troubleshooting) is not be-all end-all of troubleshooting solutions.",

I&#39;m willing to bet no consideration was given to network management, operational complexity and its impact on support costs and customer experience.<br /><br />SDN is also a vague term that seems to encompass all areas of networking. It would be more valuable if the problem was decomposed into different areas for example SDN for data centre, for campus and for WAN or break it up into Edge vs Core SDN. In my opinion these areas would have significantly different solutions.",

Look at how this is all orchestrated and controlled between the APN profiles, Tenants and EPGs, subjects, contracts, lables, bundles special multicast EPGs and all the rest of the Progresso soup and you wonder WT@#%$%^ were they thinking.  I think in one of your older posts you called it spaghetti ;)  See chapter 3 The Policy Data Center and chapter 4 Operational Model and you will see what I am talking about.   I do get it and it makes sense but you think they could have come up with a better approach/system to simplify.<br /><br />Regards...",

      "html": "Great post Ivan. The design and deployment is getting more complex with additional integration points in the SDN world (virtual machine managers, orchestration, automation tools etc.). While automation has the potential to reduce the number of network engineers during the run/operate phase,  when things go wrong (and they often do), you will need a specialist with sound fundamentals to fix the problem. All this means network engineers need deeper as well as wider skills to survive the  brave new world.",

It gives you a somewhat consistent view of your data center, and you can deploy something like a VLAN across multiple boxes without ever logging into one.<br /><br />If however your server/application people got further along on their path toward DevOps, they might start getting annoyed that they can deploy a VM in 5 seconds, but it still takes dozens of GUI clicks to get a new VLAN deployed. In those environments the need to program networking devices becomes pretty urgent.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />Ivan",

I do some Python myself and have used the NXOS api for some simple devops menu like use. But for the most part if you are an enterprise and have Prime DCIM to use to add vlans for example why go through the coding process. It was a bad example IMHO.",
