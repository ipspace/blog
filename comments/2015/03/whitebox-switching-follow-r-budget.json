And the difference isn&#39;t even 5% (which is already a lot) but rather 17-19%. Doubt that the point of this analysis was to provide some hard proof, but approximation looks interesting  and even &quot;explains&quot; how Arista is keeping up with a game<br />Just my 2c",

Cisco is reporting sales per product segment, but not the associated expenses, and most other companies aren&#39;t even that forthcoming. This back-of-the-napkin calculation was thus the best I could do, and as Anonymous pointed out, most companies would have to do R&amp;D in most product categories they carry.<br /><br />Also, the difference is significant - Cisco (without acquisitions) is spending twice as much on R&amp;D as HP with less than half their sales volume.",

They make a bit deal about spending $3B/year on R&amp;D.   They are doing a lot of R&amp;D in the area of silicon photonics which will play an increasingly important role in networking.  ",
