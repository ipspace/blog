            <div class="comment-content">And that makes your conclusion somewhat of a leap - the dollars Dell do spend on R&amp;D may be disproportionately on storage and networking.  Likewise a bunch of Cisco&#39;s greater spend will be on voice/conferencing/servers etc.  </div>

            <div class="comment-content">Simon, I think you&#39;re right, however the most probable assumption would be that HP and DELL are also spreading their R&amp;D costs among different products. And the difference isn&#39;t even 5% (which is already a lot) but rather 17-19%. Doubt that the point of this analysis was to provide some hard proof, but approximation looks interesting  and even &quot;explains&quot; how Arista is keeping up with a game<br />Just my 2c</div>

            <div class="comment-content">@Simon: You&#39;re absolutely right, but I wasn&#39;t able to find per-product line numbers. Cisco is reporting sales per product segment, but not the associated expenses, and most other companies aren&#39;t even that forthcoming. This back-of-the-napkin calculation was thus the best I could do, and as Anonymous pointed out, most companies would have to do R&amp;D in most product categories they carry.<br /><br />Also, the difference is significant - Cisco (without acquisitions) is spending twice as much on R&amp;D as HP with less than half their sales volume.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">HP has traditionally spent about 2.5-3% of their revenue on R&amp;D, you can look at more data here:  <br /><br />http://www.zdnet.com/article/hps-r-d-spending-back-to-2008-levels/<br /><br />It&#39;s considered low compared to a lot of other tech companies, but again it&#39;s hard to say what that means.  They make a bit deal about spending $3B/year on R&amp;D.   They are doing a lot of R&amp;D in the area of silicon photonics which will play an increasingly important role in networking.  </div>
