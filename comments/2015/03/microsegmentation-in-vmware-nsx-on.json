      "html": "Excellent show, very informative. Brad&#39;s NSX knowledge and Ivan&#39;s question were a perfect mix. Very compelling and I have recommended the dist FW solution a couple of times, but I like the non use of overlay&#39;s as a segment solution for multi tier applications and the movment.   Going through the ACI review now and their policy use of the VXLAN reserved bits gives one some &quot;reservation&quot;. .<br /><br />Oh I Ivan. I like the &quot;evil bit&quot; comment. I have to remember that one.<br /><br />Good show fellas",
