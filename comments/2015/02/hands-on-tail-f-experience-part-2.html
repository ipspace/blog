            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;m very interested to hear about NCS...   doesn&#39;t seem to be much concrete information published about it.    I originally figured that this was vaporware.<br /><br />I don&#39;t suppose Tail-F would think about releasing  A  &#39;Try Out&#39; version  for learning how the modelling works and what it can do with 2 or 3 routers,  and perhaps some detailed documentation....<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
