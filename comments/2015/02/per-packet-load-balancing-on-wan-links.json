      "html": "My previous employer used to do this with &#39;bonded&#39; ADSL lines - we used to ensure that each ADSL was fixed rate (even then you could never guarantee an actual fixed rate over old copper) but would always tell sales/customers that it would only ever perform as well as the slowest link - they didn&#39;t care - at least until it wasn&#39;t performing well enough. <br /><br />IIRC we sometimes got better results with per-dest but it was never perfect.  Damn, I hated that product. ",

If the network just does normal flow-based load-balancing, the routers on the asymmetrical link will simply load-balance the subflows as they normally would, and each subflow will increase its window size until it fills its pipe.",

      "html": "Exactly right, per-packet load balancing over stateless networks does not work. Being &quot;on both sides&quot; takes care of the reassembly and reorder. In addition, the injection of packets on sending is done on the basis of an intelligent algorithm that take into account the state {bandwidth, packet loss, jitter, latency} of each connected link and the application being sent. This greatly reduces the reorder problem.",
