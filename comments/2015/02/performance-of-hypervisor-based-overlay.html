            <div class="comment-content">Also be very careful with shared storage and client mounted storage in a hypervisor or shared environment. Depending upon use case latency can be the killer moreso that throughput here (storage / voice). Disable TSO/GSO/LRO/GRO on guests and on hypervisor if mounting remote storage and for non-local flows. However, watch the video below to see the 3-5Gbps observed limits vs.10Gbps... profound consequences for VXLAN and any encapsulation/fragmentation I would have thought etc...<br /><br />                 === *OLDY BUT A MUST WATCH* ===<br /><br />Virtual Networking Performance: LinuxConfAU 2011 &quot;Stephen Hemminger (Linux Kernel Dev&quot; also of Vyatta <br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acHXGURF070<br />4m55s 15 Rules :)<br />7m40s LRO not good for any routing/classifying.. only for guest to guest...<br /><br />Note: VMWare: http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=2055140</div>

            <div class="comment-content">RPS (in software) also makes quite a difference if RSS isn&#39;t available, but obviously at the cost of CPU overhead. You should try and get Tom Herbert of Google on the podcast; that would be something for those of us digging deeper into this subject. <br /><br />As per Donal, worth noting most offload features will probably cause problems if you are forwarding/routing.<br /><br />Cheers</div>
