  html: CPU L1 cache has a lot of similarities to TCAM, so the performance scalability
    concerns make a lot of sense.  Dedicating a core or 2 to forwarding gives you
    a dedicated cache.  <br /><br />Keeping the table sizes small is important - really
    not too dissimilar to the same concerns you&#39;d have in a ToR switch.  Some
    tricks like conversational-based L2 &amp; L3 push to cache might help here.

    html: '#1 - Almost. Memory is always limited unless you have an ideal Turing machine
      ;) ... but I don&#39;t expect anyone to build a virtual network that would be
      large enough to exceed the memory size of modern servers ;))<br /><br />#2 -
      Coming to that one (tomorrow). The actual performance hit depends on whether
      NIC hardware supports TCP offload over tunnels or not, but there won&#39;t be
      much difference in performance (if any - due to all other things that need to
      be done) based on the lookup table sizes.<br /><br />#3 - As always, the answer
      is &quot;it depends&quot;. In most environments, the hypervisors have some spare
      CPU capacity, but of course it&#39;s always better to have dedicated hardware
      (particularly if it&#39;s bundled with the default server hardware configuration).'

  html: Ivan.<br /><br />Reading both the threads, You suggest that <br /><br />1)
    Scale is not a problem as there is always unlimited memory on hypervisor.  <br
    /><br />2) There is no performance difference between tunnels (NVO) &amp; non-tunnels
    (VLANs or no VLANs) but Performance depends on CPU cache size. If size-of-table
    &gt; CPU-cache then there is performance hit. <br /><br />3) Another angle to
    the discussion is cost. Which of the following is less expensive ? <br /> - Burning
    extra CPUs for forwarding.<br /> - NIC offloads<br /> - Is dedicated hardware
    better ?

  html: I believe the Linux/BSD kernels have the concept of a &quot;forwarding cache&quot;,
    which is a small hash table based on 5 or 7-tuple that fits in a few cache lines.
    This holds forwarding information for recently seen flows.<br /><br />Wouldn&#39;t
    this mean that forwarding latency on software based hosts does in fact scale with
    the number of *flows*, decreasing rapidly when there are enough flows to require
    hash table accesses to L2/L3 cache?<br /><br />OVS, DPDK, and other user-space
    forwarding techniques could be different than kernel-based forwarding I suppose.
