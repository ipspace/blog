Lets move our old friends of protocols and their FSM, arp, lacp, insert here  bla bla bla over here now to do the same thing.  Yes I was shoveling some slush today after a Northeast winter blast.",

But of course, the switch needs to have match fields and set-field/copy-field actions implemented for ARP fields. <br /><br />KR",

However, I realized that Big switch&#39;s idea of adding local ARP table + agent to the switch is probably one of the several ways this issue could be resolved. <br />With new OF switches coming out that can support million flows - I think adding an arp rule shouldn&#39;t be a problem.",
