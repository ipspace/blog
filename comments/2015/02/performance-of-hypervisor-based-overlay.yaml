  html: 'Also be very careful with shared storage and client mounted storage in a
    hypervisor or shared environment. Depending upon use case latency can be the killer
    moreso that throughput here (storage / voice). Disable TSO/GSO/LRO/GRO on guests
    and on hypervisor if mounting remote storage and for non-local flows. However,
    watch the video below to see the 3-5Gbps observed limits vs.10Gbps... profound
    consequences for VXLAN and any encapsulation/fragmentation I would have thought
    etc...<br /><br />                 === *OLDY BUT A MUST WATCH* ===<br /><br />Virtual

  html: RPS (in software) also makes quite a difference if RSS isn&#39;t available,
    but obviously at the cost of CPU overhead. You should try and get Tom Herbert
    of Google on the podcast; that would be something for those of us digging deeper
    into this subject. <br /><br />As per Donal, worth noting most offload features
    will probably cause problems if you are forwarding/routing.<br /><br />Cheers
