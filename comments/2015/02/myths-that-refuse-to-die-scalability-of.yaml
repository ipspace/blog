    html: KK, I&#39;m talking about the impact of large-scale deployments on performance,
      not about actual performance figures. The point is that there&#39;s little forwarding
      performance difference between small and large deployments.<br /><br />On the
      topic of hash table sizing - most implementations resize the table once the
      load factor exceeds a certain limit. Resizing is admittedly hard in real-time
      environments, but even Wikipedia lists a few tricks you can use.

  html: 'Are we comparing apples-to-apples ?.<br /><br />Comparison should be made
    between bare-metal with *No TCP* offload to a system having vSwitch in it. Obviously,
    one may need to burn more CPUs for this.<br /><br />Comparing vSwitch performance
    with TCP-offloaded system seems not right but comparing Offloaded-vSwitch + TCP
    to pure TCP offloaded system is a probably right. Intelligent NICs have scalability
    limit too, so is it beneficial to have intelligent NICs or have them on HW boxes
    ? I am not sure if there any pointers that take in to consideration for all the
    variables like #CPUs, Offload, vSwitch table size, cost.<br /><br />Finally,<br
    /><br />Performance &amp; Scalability are inversely proportional after certain
    point. If one can size vSwitch to 4K, works without performance impact for 4K
    flows only (assuming hashing works perfectly). Anything more than 4K will have
    performance issue. Of-course, one could off-set it by adding more CPUs.<br />'

    html: There were two parts of the argument:<br /><br />(A) Doing tunnel encapsulation
      in software is expensive<br />(B) Hypervisor-based tunnels don&#39;t scale,
      it&#39;s better to do them on the ToR switches.<br /><br />This blog post is
      focused on (B), tomorrow I&#39;ll cover (A) ;)

    html: Join to Angelos message. I&#39;ve got the same point from watching video.<br
      /><br />Waiting for post about (A).<br />

  html: Hello Ivan,<br /><br />I am not sure about this, but from what i understood,
    Sunay was only saying that forwarding in software is not optimized for tunnels,
    but only for direct TCP/IP/Ethernet. As a result, the third bullet in your list
    is actually (as currently implemented) quite expensive.<br />Due to this expense,
    they are trying to offload the third step of the list (the &quot;adding tunnel
    encapsulation&quot; part) away from traditional OS kernels which are not optimized
    for this function.<br /><br />These are not my opinions, this is just what i understood
    from reading and watching the video.
