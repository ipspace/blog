          "html": "Need some more coffee but think he was just suggesting multi-tenancy should be enforced with other things besides L2 and the network should focus on routing traffic to endpoints. The interwebs works because it focuses on L3, why all the duct tape and bandaids inside the datacenter. However, if everything was truly peer-to-peer on a shared L3 medium, multi-tenancy would require encryption at the endpoints (ex. SSL vs. L2 vlan). i.e. EndpointA in Tenant Group 1 in DC1 needs to securely communicate with Endpoint B also in Tenant Group 1. Industry came close to a *full* peer-to-peer world with IPV6 as one of goals was to increase address space and reduce need for multiplexing with PAT/SNAT (i.e. let go of idea of end nodes in tenant domains sharing same address space ... they all get their own unique address which are ephemeral as mac addresses).  However, until the holy grail where all endpoints (client/server apps) let go of L2, assume L3 world and use encryption on all their communication (both intra-tenant and public),  PAT/SNAT (which requires the &quot;dreaded&quot; state) is a pretty nice fenced house with one way door. Although I have to say, as a tenant, even if I have my own firewall (iptables) and diligently communicate securely with all my peers (SSL), being bare on exposed on the internet taking 10G of L7 attacks on my own front door doesn&#39;t sound so fun :-). As the old saying goes, the internet is unfortunately a lot nastier than most neighborhoods so even though a lock on your door is good,  sometimes funneled ( or dreaded &quot;state&quot; )  access through a gated community is certainly nice.  back to coffee++  ",

      "html": "Well, your article as well as Mark Burgess&#39;s blog both point to a serious failure of the networking industry to deliver ubiquitous state-of-the art L2 technology.<br /><br />Back in 2001 (i.e. long before VPLS), the group of IXP operators proposed to redesign L2 according to L3 best-practices - by replacing thick yellow cable emulation and all Spanning tree stuff with IS-IS based routing of ethernet packets. Guess what - no vendor was interested. When Radia Perlman in 2004 presented the first TRILL proposal to IEEE, it was - rejected.<br /><br />Several years later, two next-gen L2 standards were finalized - TRILL (based on L3 principles) and SPB (enhanced STP). Yet worse, every major vendor implemented its own next-gen L2 solution, of course totally incompatible with any of the standards. In the meantime, hacks like M-LAG (vPC) were developed to workaround apparent defficiences of outdated L2 technology.<br /><br />In such a mess, it&#39;s no surprise that people consider L2 unusable and try to avoid it whereever possible. Hypervisor vendors decided to fix the problem in their own domain by yet another method (VXLAN, NVGRE,...) but this requires new NIC hardware and only works in DC environment. As such it&#39;s no solution to the main problem, since advanced L2 is needed in every LAN to get rid of thick yellow cable emulation and STP limitations.<br /><br />Just FYI, in September 2014 we implemented TRILL-based infrastructure in the Slovak Internet eXchange. After 5 months of production, our experience shows that even though TRILL delivers standard L2 interface on the edge ports, inside it operates on exactly the same principles as any L3 network, utilizing field-proven IS-IS protocol for ethernet frame routing and TTL &amp; RPF checks to prevent network meltdown.<br /><br />So decent L2 technology definitely exists today - but the main problem is that the networking industry is unable to converge on single technical solution due to commercial reasons. This couldn&#39;t be fixed by resorting to L3.<br />",

      "html": "I wrote a much longer post which got lost but to summarize.  <br /><br />L2 overlays came from VMs moving or being spun up wherever there was free compute.   It needed L2 because somewhere else another application or network element like a FW or LB was setup based on that VM/service having a specific IP.  That&#39;s the crux of the issue.   <br /><br />The L2 overlays are getting better.  Vendors are solving tromboning using anycasted default GWs, VXLAN can work with L3 directly into a VRF instead of just building a L2 overlay.  VXLAN-GPE supports direct v4/v6 encapsulation.  We have moved the underlay from L2 to L3.  <br /><br />However it will take an orchestration system to redirect endpoints as needed, or at least reprogram DNS entries if that&#39;s a valid option.  Contextream has a solution based on NVO3 overlays coupled with LISP.   So LISP takes care of the endpoint moving behind another IP address.  However LISP doesn&#39;t have great support, so maybe DNS is the answer, along with more intelligent upstream devices which don&#39;t care what IP something is at.   Junos Contrail is a L3 overlay, not a L2 overlay, and does so by using host routing over tunnels with a VNID/MPLS label as an identifier.  A firewall instance doesn&#39;t need to be in the same subnet as the end host, it just needs to know the tunnel to get to it.   Now it would be easier without tunnels altogether, but we aren&#39;t there yet.   <br />",
