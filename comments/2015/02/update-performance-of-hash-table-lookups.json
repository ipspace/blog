      "html": "CPU L1 cache has a lot of similarities to TCAM, so the performance scalability concerns make a lot of sense.  Dedicating a core or 2 to forwarding gives you a dedicated cache.  <br /><br />Keeping the table sizes small is important - really not too dissimilar to the same concerns you&#39;d have in a ToR switch.  Some tricks like conversational-based L2 &amp; L3 push to cache might help here.",

          "html": "#1 - Almost. Memory is always limited unless you have an ideal Turing machine ;) ... but I don&#39;t expect anyone to build a virtual network that would be large enough to exceed the memory size of modern servers ;))<br /><br />#2 - Coming to that one (tomorrow). The actual performance hit depends on whether NIC hardware supports TCP offload over tunnels or not, but there won&#39;t be much difference in performance (if any - due to all other things that need to be done) based on the lookup table sizes.<br /><br />#3 - As always, the answer is &quot;it depends&quot;. In most environments, the hypervisors have some spare CPU capacity, but of course it&#39;s always better to have dedicated hardware (particularly if it&#39;s bundled with the default server hardware configuration).",

      "html": "Ivan.<br /><br />Reading both the threads, You suggest that <br /><br />1) Scale is not a problem as there is always unlimited memory on hypervisor.  <br /><br />2) There is no performance difference between tunnels (NVO) &amp; non-tunnels (VLANs or no VLANs) but Performance depends on CPU cache size. If size-of-table &gt; CPU-cache then there is performance hit. <br /><br />3) Another angle to the discussion is cost. Which of the following is less expensive ? <br /> - Burning extra CPUs for forwarding.<br /> - NIC offloads<br /> - Is dedicated hardware better ?",

      "html": "I believe the Linux/BSD kernels have the concept of a &quot;forwarding cache&quot;, which is a small hash table based on 5 or 7-tuple that fits in a few cache lines. This holds forwarding information for recently seen flows.<br /><br />Wouldn&#39;t this mean that forwarding latency on software based hosts does in fact scale with the number of *flows*, decreasing rapidly when there are enough flows to require hash table accesses to L2/L3 cache?<br /><br />OVS, DPDK, and other user-space forwarding techniques could be different than kernel-based forwarding I suppose.",
