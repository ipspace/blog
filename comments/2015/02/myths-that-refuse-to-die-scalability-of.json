The point is that there&#39;s little forwarding performance difference between small and large deployments.<br /><br />On the topic of hash table sizing - most implementations resize the table once the load factor exceeds a certain limit. Resizing is admittedly hard in real-time environments, but even Wikipedia lists a few tricks you can use.",

      "html": "Are we comparing apples-to-apples ?.<br /><br />Comparison should be made between bare-metal with *No TCP* offload to a system having vSwitch in it. Obviously, one may need to burn more CPUs for this.<br /><br />Comparing vSwitch performance with TCP-offloaded system seems not right but comparing Offloaded-vSwitch + TCP to pure TCP offloaded system is a probably right. Intelligent NICs have scalability limit too, so is it beneficial to have intelligent NICs or have them on HW boxes ? I am not sure if there any pointers that take in to consideration for all the variables like #CPUs, Offload, vSwitch table size, cost.<br /><br />Finally,<br /><br />Performance &amp; Scalability are inversely proportional after certain point. If one can size vSwitch to 4K, works without performance impact for 4K flows only (assuming hashing works perfectly). Anything more than 4K will have performance issue. Of-course, one could off-set it by adding more CPUs.<br />",

      "html": "Hello Ivan,<br /><br />I am not sure about this, but from what i understood, Sunay was only saying that forwarding in software is not optimized for tunnels, but only for direct TCP/IP/Ethernet. As a result, the third bullet in your list is actually (as currently implemented) quite expensive.<br />Due to this expense, they are trying to offload the third step of the list (the &quot;adding tunnel encapsulation&quot; part) away from traditional OS kernels which are not optimized for this function.<br /><br />These are not my opinions, this is just what i understood from reading and watching the video.",
