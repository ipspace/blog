  html: 'Thanks for taking the time to talk with us Ivan!  If your readers are interested,
    all of our OpenFlow extensions are actually available in open source.  Just check
    out the descriptions in our &quot;Loxi&quot; OpenFlow library project here: https://github.com/floodlight/loxigen/tree/master/openflow_input'

  html: Good post Ivan, It just seems with all the &quot;this and that&quot; for control
    and data plane enhancing and scaling it comes across as just shoveling the slush
    after a winter mix of snow/rain from one side of the driveway to another. Lets
    move our old friends of protocols and their FSM, arp, lacp, insert here  bla bla
    bla over here now to do the same thing.  Yes I was shoveling some slush today
    after a Northeast winter blast.

    html: You cannot generate ARP replies with existing OpenFlow actions (if that&#39;s
      what you had in mind). ARP request has to be sent to the controller, and that
      kills scalability.

    html: I agree with you that ARP request has to go to the controller for the first
      time but then controller can install an ARP rule in the OVS switch to handle
      the future ARP messages.  If host moves then controller can purge the old ARP
      rule and insert the new rule in the new switch

    html: Hello.<br /><br />I recently came accross this article about building an
      openflow router with OVS:<br />http://dtucker.co.uk/hack/building-a-router-with-openvswitch.html<br
      /><br />They used a flow table 105 &quot;ARP responder&quot; to send out ARP
      replies for their virtual default gateway address.<br />Couldn&#39;t this be
      used to send any arbitrary ARP reply?<br />The controller could install a flow
      entry into the &quot;ARP responder&quot; flow table every time the switch receives
      an unknown ARP request ...<br /><br />They used OF 1.3. But of course, the switch
      needs to have match fields and set-field/copy-field actions implemented for
      ARP fields. <br /><br />KR

    html: 'From their description: &quot;In this table we use some OVS-Jitsu to take
      an incoming ARP Request and turn it into an ARP reply&quot; - seems to be an
      OVS-specific extension.<br /><br />Also. look at the sample flow tables (at
      the bottom of the post). Table 105 uses NXM flows (Nicira extensions).<br /><br
      />I would love to see ARP handling within standard OpenFlow, but it&#39;s not
      there yet...<br /><br />'

  html: Thanks Ivan... I read posts closely and I think they are very helpful. However,
    I realized that Big switch&#39;s idea of adding local ARP table + agent to the
    switch is probably one of the several ways this issue could be resolved. <br />With
    new OF switches coming out that can support million flows - I think adding an
    arp rule shouldn&#39;t be a problem.

    html: 'All exploits that were possible in the past are still possible in the brave
      new world. Just because something is centralized doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s secure.<br
      /><br />It is, however, easier to enforce consistent policy across the whole
      network, which _could_ make certain exploits harder and/or impossible. See,
      for example, http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/10/ipv6-first-hop-security-ideal-openflow.html<br
      /><br />Note: I&#39;m not saying BSN is doing anything along those lines, I&#39;m
      just saying it can be done ;)<br />'

  html: Just made me wonder about the security exploits possible. We had arp poising
    in the past can similar &quot;hi-jinx&quot; be done via deadly OVS/any controller
    deployed ARP rule?
