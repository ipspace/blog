    html: I had the same interpretation. Overlays are an abomination so let&#39;s
      replace them with... NAT.

    html: 'Need some more coffee but think he was just suggesting multi-tenancy should
      be enforced with other things besides L2 and the network should focus on routing
      traffic to endpoints. The interwebs works because it focuses on L3, why all
      the duct tape and bandaids inside the datacenter. However, if everything was
      truly peer-to-peer on a shared L3 medium, multi-tenancy would require encryption
      at the endpoints (ex. SSL vs. L2 vlan). i.e. EndpointA in Tenant Group 1 in
      DC1 needs to securely communicate with Endpoint B also in Tenant Group 1. Industry
      came close to a *full* peer-to-peer world with IPV6 as one of goals was to increase
      address space and reduce need for multiplexing with PAT/SNAT (i.e. let go of
      idea of end nodes in tenant domains sharing same address space ... they all
      get their own unique address which are ephemeral as mac addresses).  However,
      until the holy grail where all endpoints (client/server apps) let go of L2,
      assume L3 world and use encryption on all their communication (both intra-tenant
      and public),  PAT/SNAT (which requires the &quot;dreaded&quot; state) is a pretty
      nice fenced house with one way door. Although I have to say, as a tenant, even
      if I have my own firewall (iptables) and diligently communicate securely with
      all my peers (SSL), being bare on exposed on the internet taking 10G of L7 attacks
      on my own front door doesn&#39;t sound so fun :-). As the old saying goes, the
      internet is unfortunately a lot nastier than most neighborhoods so even though
      a lock on your door is good,  sometimes funneled ( or dreaded &quot;state&quot;
      )  access through a gated community is certainly nice.  back to coffee++  '

    html: You have to ensure that a tenant retains its privacy (which can be done
      with packet filters), not that it gets private IP addresses (which would require
      NAT or some sort of tunnels).<br /><br />Like Mark wrote in his essay, you cannot
      dictate what your room# will be in the hotel. We should stop assigning overloaded
      meanings to IP addresses.

    html: "True. Side effect of multiplexing.  The point was really more agreeing\
      \ to the premise that application owners have come around and want less L2 (spanning),\
      \ not more.  They\u2019ve practiced, taken off their training wheels and quickly\
      \ adapted to the stateless L3 chaos monkey AWS environments and are looking\

      \ /><br />See you are definitely not alone<br /><br />Will only be a matter\
      \ of time until they self service their own tenancy/privacy/group membership\
      \ up the stack  (ex. whether peer-to-peer encryption or identity based/certificate\

  html: 'From the linked article:  &quot;Virtualization of addresses does not need
    to interfere with that, if we simply use a service that implements private namespaces
    on top of public IP addresses, there is no need even for tunnels (Russian doll
    encapsulation).&quot;<br /><br />Isn&#39;t he basically describing NAT/PAT without
    using those terms?  Am I missing something here?'

  html: Mark Burgess&#39;s blog seems to be a tirade against overlays and slavishly
    virtualizing the physical network, whereas your blog seems to suggest that overlays
    might the solution with L2 only going to the vswitch, with presumably L3 in physical
    network (and the overlay slavishly virtualizing the physical)-- so these are completely
    opposite conclusions!<br /><br />Or am I missing something?<br />

  html: Well, your article as well as Mark Burgess&#39;s blog both point to a serious
    failure of the networking industry to deliver ubiquitous state-of-the art L2 technology.<br
    /><br />Back in 2001 (i.e. long before VPLS), the group of IXP operators proposed
    to redesign L2 according to L3 best-practices - by replacing thick yellow cable
    emulation and all Spanning tree stuff with IS-IS based routing of ethernet packets.
    Guess what - no vendor was interested. When Radia Perlman in 2004 presented the
    first TRILL proposal to IEEE, it was - rejected.<br /><br />Several years later,
    two next-gen L2 standards were finalized - TRILL (based on L3 principles) and
    SPB (enhanced STP). Yet worse, every major vendor implemented its own next-gen
    L2 solution, of course totally incompatible with any of the standards. In the
    meantime, hacks like M-LAG (vPC) were developed to workaround apparent defficiences
    of outdated L2 technology.<br /><br />In such a mess, it&#39;s no surprise that
    people consider L2 unusable and try to avoid it whereever possible. Hypervisor
    vendors decided to fix the problem in their own domain by yet another method (VXLAN,
    NVGRE,...) but this requires new NIC hardware and only works in DC environment.
    As such it&#39;s no solution to the main problem, since advanced L2 is needed
    in every LAN to get rid of thick yellow cable emulation and STP limitations.<br
    /><br />Just FYI, in September 2014 we implemented TRILL-based infrastructure
    in the Slovak Internet eXchange. After 5 months of production, our experience
    shows that even though TRILL delivers standard L2 interface on the edge ports,
    inside it operates on exactly the same principles as any L3 network, utilizing
    field-proven IS-IS protocol for ethernet frame routing and TTL &amp; RPF checks
    to prevent network meltdown.<br /><br />So decent L2 technology definitely exists
    today - but the main problem is that the networking industry is unable to converge
    on single technical solution due to commercial reasons. This couldn&#39;t be fixed
    by resorting to L3.<br />

  html: Best quote from the essay:<br /><br />&quot;I see people arguing for a dynamic
    infrastructure. That is wrong thinking. Infrastructure and foundations are meant
    to be stable. What you build on top of that can be dynamic.&quot;

  html: I wrote a much longer post which got lost but to summarize.  <br /><br />L2
    overlays came from VMs moving or being spun up wherever there was free compute.   It
    needed L2 because somewhere else another application or network element like a
    FW or LB was setup based on that VM/service having a specific IP.  That&#39;s
    the crux of the issue.   <br /><br />The L2 overlays are getting better.  Vendors
    are solving tromboning using anycasted default GWs, VXLAN can work with L3 directly
    into a VRF instead of just building a L2 overlay.  VXLAN-GPE supports direct v4/v6
    encapsulation.  We have moved the underlay from L2 to L3.  <br /><br />However
    it will take an orchestration system to redirect endpoints as needed, or at least
    reprogram DNS entries if that&#39;s a valid option.  Contextream has a solution
    based on NVO3 overlays coupled with LISP.   So LISP takes care of the endpoint
    moving behind another IP address.  However LISP doesn&#39;t have great support,
    so maybe DNS is the answer, along with more intelligent upstream devices which
    don&#39;t care what IP something is at.   Junos Contrail is a L3 overlay, not
    a L2 overlay, and does so by using host routing over tunnels with a VNID/MPLS
    label as an identifier.  A firewall instance doesn&#39;t need to be in the same
    subnet as the end host, it just needs to know the tunnel to get to it.   Now it
    would be easier without tunnels altogether, but we aren&#39;t there yet.   <br

  html: Hi, <br />your post intrigues me... <br />How can you get rid of L2 when you
    have remote sides that need DHCP over public internet .. or when you run hotspots
    ? <br />
