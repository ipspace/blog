  html: 'I believe that FCoE (or any converged storage &amp; networking solution,
    including iSCSI or whatever storage solution) is the paradigmatic example of QoS
    requirement in the DC. The Enhanced Transmission Selection (802.1Qaz) in Data
    Center Ethernet handles specifically this case by guaranteeing bandwidth reservations
    for different traffic classes. Also, since some storage solutions (FC) or different
    traffic types (VoIP) do not run over TCP, they also designed a congestion avoidance
    mechanism in layer-2 (802.1Qau, congestion notification). '

    html: '&quot;Would it make sense to create a separate network for IP/distributed
      storage with Ethernet being so cheap?&quot; - absolutely. A lot of people (including
      Amazon) are doing that.'

  html: 'Good post Ivan. This discussion keeps coming up. Equipment vendors keep talking
    up their DC QoS features, but I don&#39;t see need to QoS in DC unless there is
    distributed storage....Would it make sense to create a separate network for IP/distributed
    storage with Ethernet being so cheap? '

    html: 'Exactly this (after translating it). Microbursts require QoS. There are
      plenty of applications, especially in the data center, that assume a lossless
      environment and will not act well without QoS, even on 10 GE. Luckily the policy
      usually doesn&#39;t have to be complex: just have a lossless queue somewhere.'

  html: 'Not sure if applicable to DC, but the author of http://habrahabr.ru/post/246791/
    (in russian) makes a case from SP perspective: there is a problem of microbursts
    and oversubscription in thei network.'

  html: Also see that with NFV vCPE use case, SP customers are looking for QoS features
    needed on End VNFs acting as vCPE (not end applications). Is QoS applicable in
    this scenario??

    html: '&quot;Depends of the DC&quot; &lt;&lt; In principle of course I have to
      agree<br /><br />&quot;if we are talking about DC with VDI&quot; &lt;&lt; hope
      you&#39;ll have 10GE links to the servers and 40GE or 100GE uplinks. How much
      traffic does a VDI session generate?'

  html: 'Depends of the DC.. For example, if we are talking about DC with VDI, there
    is no big difference from office network. And QoS should be implemented. <br />Also,
    as it was mentioned here - microburst can added some small issues time to time. '
