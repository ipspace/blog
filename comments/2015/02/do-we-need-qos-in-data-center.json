      "html": "I believe that FCoE (or any converged storage &amp; networking solution, including iSCSI or whatever storage solution) is the paradigmatic example of QoS requirement in the DC. The Enhanced Transmission Selection (802.1Qaz) in Data Center Ethernet handles specifically this case by guaranteeing bandwidth reservations for different traffic classes. Also, since some storage solutions (FC) or different traffic types (VoIP) do not run over TCP, they also designed a congestion avoidance mechanism in layer-2 (802.1Qau, congestion notification). ",
