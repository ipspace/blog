An architecture using centralized control plane is the wrong tool for this job.<br /><br />Long-lived high-band sessions are an obvious exception.",

      "html": "Really good post. <br /><br />I agree the real question is really what do you want to accomplish with LB balancing. Would you point me to articles that describe what are the main use cases for LB?<br /><br />Openflow doesn&#39;t really do L4 forwarding efficiently as you explained. But it MAY(or not) be a better programming interface than scripts. I have the feeling that there&#39;s still value in OpenFlow Based LB because it&#39;s cheap. One could use ECMP groups to spread load to anycast server farms as you mentioned, and then use a software load-balancer to do the rest of the job. I&#39;d assume that&#39;d be much cheaper than 100K Vendor Hardware.",

Maybe find a programmer to integrate OpenFlow into Linux HAproxy...<br /><br />Amazon must be doing something SDN-like for their ELB services, so it&#39;s an interesting question that someone out there has probably managed to do.<br /><br />In the real world it will be much easier (maybe cheaper too) to just install an F5/A10/Netscalar/HAproxy solution.<br />",
