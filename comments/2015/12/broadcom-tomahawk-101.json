They did that to try to keep up with the forwarding rate implied by the sum of the interface rates. If that&#39;s true, I suspect that the 16 MB of packet buffer has 4 MB attached to each core. The max buffer available to any flow is capped by what its core can give it. This is all written like its &quot;something I know.&quot; It really is a question. Is this how the buffer falls out? Older Tridents are all single forwarding core design.<br /><br />Jim Warner, Univ Cal Santa Cruz",
