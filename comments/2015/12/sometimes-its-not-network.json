      "html": "Nowdays network is tightly coupled with applications and sometimes it is difficult to figure out the difference between the cause &amp; effect - is the network the the root cause OR application &#39;decided&#39; to change its behaviour due to a sw bug and network responded accordingly (misleading the troubleshooter). So it&#39;s good to know the network from the traffic pattern perspective - know what is normal behaviour. ",

Most people myself included would have given up after pinging the router and server because going deeper would have generated blank stares. What amazes me the most is that Cloudflare has people with patience to do such a thorough investigation.",

      "html": "It&#39;s also worth noting that sometimes the problem could be ISP equipment. I&#39;ve recently had to troubleshoot a 10M fiber TLS WAN issue where I was getting the allotted bandwidth, but as soon as I put any decent load over the WAN, our packet round trip time jumped from idling at 1-2ms  to 300-500ms (normally we would get between 15-25ms at a good load). After days of troubleshooting and removing as much equipment as possible between sending/receiving ends, I concluded that it must be a problem with the ISP equipment. Sure enough, they insisted their equipment was  functioning properly.. After it was all said in done, it ended up being a Layer 1 issue - the ISP&#39;s Fiber to Ethernet Media converter.. ugh!  .. and yes, IPerf came in handy!",
