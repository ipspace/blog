            <div class="comment-content">All this sounds like the old switching methods as you mention. And Cisco&#39;s CEF was created as an improvement of fast-switching. But this isn&#39;t new. So no.. this can&#39;t be what is meant as &quot;flow-based forwarding&quot; this discussion?!<br /><br />Maybe what is meant is a &quot;flow/cache&quot; that&#39;s defining the full forwarding path - so only &quot;one&quot; router/control plane has to create a forwarding path(The forwarding decision only has to be made once regardless of the number of hops) for the flow to the destination.. like a virtual circuit.. perhaps I&#39;m talking gibberish.<br /><br />I&#39;m confused and intrigued at the same time.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">It sounds like we have a &#39;solution&#39; (loosely defined &#39;flow-based forwarding) and we are looking for a problem;)<br /><br />I would start with defining the problem and then talk about the solutions. Maybe following this path we could understand the originally cited &#39;flow-based forwarding&#39; superiority over regular forwarding;)<br /><br />Again, we are still talking about definition of the &#39;flow-based forwarding&#39; which actually may depend on marketing trends (&#39;coolness&#39; factor) </div>

            <div class="comment-content">Flow-based forwarding sounds like what many firewalls already do with session tables. If a session is already established, it skips everything except the session lookup and sends the packet. This only works because firewalls keep state, whereas routers and switches do not, and arguably should not.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Flow-based forwarding at the first sight looks like a kind of approximation of channel forwarding as defined in G.800 Section 8.1. It is contrasted with destination forwarding as described in Section 8.2. If you look into G.809 that defines what is a flow and its related terminology, then you could see that flow-based forwarding is a kind of funny terminology. Because it has nothing to do with how the forwarding is done from the outside perspective. It just wants to emphasize a special way of internal optimization. But actually, it is still destination forwarding. Since a flow is defined as an aggregation of one or more traffic units with an element of common routing, the proper term could be &quot;flow-based routing&quot;. But not forwarding... <br />In fact, this confusion between forwarding and routing is reflected in all of the caching problems you have mentioned...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The definition I use is that a &quot;flow&quot; is <b>unidirectional</b> and <b>stateless</b> series of packets from a source to a destination. This is in keeping with Cisco NetFlow&#39;s definition which dates back to 1996 (see <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,243,667.PN.&amp;OS=PN/6,243,667&amp;RS=PN/6,243,667" rel="nofollow">US patent 6,243,667</a>).<br /><br />If you want bidirectional or stateful, then you&#39;ve got a &quot;session&quot; or &quot;connection.&quot; i.e., something that hates asymmetry. Juniper&#39;s &quot;flow-based forwarding&quot; is a misnomer. It really is &quot;session-based forwarding.&quot;<br /><br />OpenFlow distorts it in a different direction by letting you customize which packet headers constitute a &quot;flow&quot; (i.e., a TCAM entry). Source-only, destination-only, source+dest L2/L3/L4, etc. OpenFlow would be more appropriately named OpenTCAM&quot;.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">MLS? Did you mean MPLS?<br /><br />The vulnerability of cache-fast-path forwarding is not limited to routers/switches. My company handles several hundred Mbps of traffic coming from hundreds of millions of unique mobile devices. Our platform of choice is Illumos (Solaris), and its networking stack would melt down the kernel with excess memory utilization in the &quot;DCE cache&quot; (next-hop cache) because of the sheer number of entries in the cache.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The side comment about LISP being cache-based confuses me (Assuming LISP = Location/Identity separation). As I understood it, LISP is packet-by packet forwarding, but with core routers using 64 of the 128 bits of an IPv6 address as the destination address and ignoring the rest, and edge routes doing the reverse. This does not need any caching that I see (tough caching CAN be used, if anyone sees value in caching lookup results - same as any packet-based lookup-and-forward router).<br />What am I missing here? </div>

What&#39;s old is new again, &amp; it doesn&#39;t work any better than it did 15 years ago.<br /><br />Funny thing is, I recently found myself wanting a feature from the crusty old Cat6500 PFC3:  microflow policing<br /><br />http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/prod_white_paper0900aecd803e5017.html<br /><br />Of course it was based on netflow TCAM, which was usually exhausted within a few seconds of activating any feature that depends on it on a box with any decent amount of traffic, but for low-bandwidth stuff it did work.<br /><br />I don&#39;t see any reason why modern NPs like Juniper Trio couldn&#39;t implement this...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Clearly this is an implementation of cache based forwarding, and optimising on the pipeline lookup stages &amp; follow on processing. This idea was also deployed by Tasman ISR, acquired by Nortel later (FYI a non-Cisco/Juniper product). <br />Nevertheless, a Openflow based switching pipeline can also benefit from a cache based early lookup and reduced inline service pipeline.(surely nobody IMO does it)<br />So technically the Juniper feature is not a flow based forwarding idea,  but a cache/netflow/sflow/tuple based forwarding pipeline optimisation. <br />Technically again this &#39;cache&#39; can be made out of a TCAM space, with match parameters and actions , so *internally* the Openflow semantics can be used to program the TCAM(if being used as a cache). Do recall that once the lookup fails in the TCAM space, the OF rules allows you to jump to legacy routing/switching pipeline.<br />A related concept is here ;<br />http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/a-radical-new-router/0<br /></div>
