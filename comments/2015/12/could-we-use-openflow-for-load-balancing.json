          "html": "According to Kemp whitepaper, they use information from the SDN controller to identify bottlenecks between the load balancer and individual servers in the server farm. <br /><br />Looks like a solution in search of a problem to me. Throwing more bandwidth at the problem is probably cheaper and definitely less complex.",

      "html": "Even with simple L3/L4, a pure openflow load-balancer would require the controller be involved in every connection setup. It might be able to outperform a 1997-era LocalDirector, but not much else.<br /><br />More realistic is a slow/fast-path approach. E.g., a standalone load-balancer directs the initial connection setup and then uses openflow to fast-path the remainder of the connection. I&#39;m guessing this is how NSX&#39;s distributed load-balancer will work.<br /><br />HP&#39;s SDN App Store does have a <a href=\"http://h20195.www2.hp.com/V2/getpdf.aspx/4AA4-5984ENW.pdf?ver=1.0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kemp load-balancer</a> adapted for OpenFlow. The solution brief indicates that openflow is used for load and health measurements only, not for connection setup or for fast-path mode.",

      "html": "You can use OpenFlow for ECMP routing, which can be used as a crude form of load distribution ( with multiple static routes to the same virtual IP, via different real server IPs ). It is only  &quot;balanced&quot; in a statistical sense, there is no mechanism to detect liveness of servers, and the return path may get asymmetrical - which limits the applicability to a select set of use cases",

      "html": "Jen Rexford and team had a <a href=\"http://cial.csie.ncku.edu.tw/st2014/pdf/OpenFlow-Based%20Server%20Load%20Balancing%20Gone%20Wild.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">fun paper</a> about this idea at HotNets a few years ago -- it&#39;s a quick and insightful read:  <br /><br />Ivan&#39;s comment about the possibility of doing this in a storage context are exactly right -- Coho Data (my company) does this in an enterprise storage product today.  Using Openflow onto Arista ToRs, we are able to present a single IP address for NFS v3, but then dynamically steer traffic over large numbers of 10Gb storage nodes.  This turns out to be a pretty big win in enterprise contexts where you can&#39;t change the client storage protocol (e.g. to deploy pNFS), and where you want to scale traffic over large numbers of very fast flash devices.<br /><br />If you&#39;re interested, I recently did a <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/143189231\" rel=\"nofollow\">talk</a> on this aspect of our system, as well as some related challenges facing network connectivity/perf in storage systems..<br /><br />@andywarfield",
