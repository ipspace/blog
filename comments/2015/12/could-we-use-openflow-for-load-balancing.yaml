    html: According to Kemp whitepaper, they use information from the SDN controller
      to identify bottlenecks between the load balancer and individual servers in
      the server farm. <br /><br />Looks like a solution in search of a problem to
      me. Throwing more bandwidth at the problem is probably cheaper and definitely
      less complex.

  html: Even with simple L3/L4, a pure openflow load-balancer would require the controller
    be involved in every connection setup. It might be able to outperform a 1997-era
    LocalDirector, but not much else.<br /><br />More realistic is a slow/fast-path
    approach. E.g., a standalone load-balancer directs the initial connection setup
    and then uses openflow to fast-path the remainder of the connection. I&#39;m guessing
    this is how NSX&#39;s distributed load-balancer will work.<br /><br />HP&#39;s
    SDN App Store does have a <a href="http://h20195.www2.hp.com/V2/getpdf.aspx/4AA4-5984ENW.pdf?ver=1.0"
    rel="nofollow">Kemp load-balancer</a> adapted for OpenFlow. The solution brief
    indicates that openflow is used for load and health measurements only, not for
    connection setup or for fast-path mode.

  html: You can use OpenFlow for ECMP routing, which can be used as a crude form of
    load distribution ( with multiple static routes to the same virtual IP, via different
    real server IPs ). It is only  &quot;balanced&quot; in a statistical sense, there
    is no mechanism to detect liveness of servers, and the return path may get asymmetrical
    - which limits the applicability to a select set of use cases

    html: Andy any links to this article or this talk? A link to the summarised and
      technical content will be much appreciated.<br />Thanks

  html: 'Jen Rexford and team had a <a href="http://cial.csie.ncku.edu.tw/st2014/pdf/OpenFlow-Based%20Server%20Load%20Balancing%20Gone%20Wild.pdf"
    rel="nofollow">fun paper</a> about this idea at HotNets a few years ago -- it&#39;s
    a quick and insightful read:  <br /><br />Ivan&#39;s comment about the possibility
    of doing this in a storage context are exactly right -- Coho Data (my company)
    does this in an enterprise storage product today.  Using Openflow onto Arista
    ToRs, we are able to present a single IP address for NFS v3, but then dynamically
    steer traffic over large numbers of 10Gb storage nodes.  This turns out to be
    a pretty big win in enterprise contexts where you can&#39;t change the client
    storage protocol (e.g. to deploy pNFS), and where you want to scale traffic over
    large numbers of very fast flash devices.<br /><br />If you&#39;re interested,
    I recently did a <a href="http://vimeo.com/143189231" rel="nofollow">talk</a>
    on this aspect of our system, as well as some related challenges facing network
    connectivity/perf in storage systems..<br /><br />@andywarfield'
