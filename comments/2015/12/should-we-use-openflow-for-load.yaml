  html: 'If you want a L4 LB you are probably better off playing with ECMP, the hashing
    algorithm (enabling the resilient feature to avoid rehashing), next-hop groups
    and a script to test your services and enable/disable available next-hops. At
    least compared to using openflow : )'

    html: The real question is &quot;what do you want your LB to do&quot;, and if
      you want to do anything beyond baseline 5-tuple load balancing, hardware is
      not the way to go... at which point all the discussions about OpenFlow/P4/whatever
      become just a nice excuse to generate 2-column articles.<br /><br />L7 load
      balancing is a solved problem both at small scale and at Google/Facebook scale.
      An architecture using centralized control plane is the wrong tool for this job.<br
      /><br />Long-lived high-band sessions are an obvious exception.

  html: Perhaps forward looking this is a discussion of P4 rather than OpenFlow, possibly
    in concert with whatever Barefoot Networks is doing.

    html: You might find something relevant in this slide set:<br /><br />http://content.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Scalable<br
      /><br />I also covered L4-7 load balancing in more details in here:<br /><br
      />http://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DC30<br /><br />... or you could start with
      Wikipedia ;)

  html: Really good post. <br /><br />I agree the real question is really what do
    you want to accomplish with LB balancing. Would you point me to articles that
    describe what are the main use cases for LB?<br /><br />Openflow doesn&#39;t really
    do L4 forwarding efficiently as you explained. But it MAY(or not) be a better
    programming interface than scripts. I have the feeling that there&#39;s still
    value in OpenFlow Based LB because it&#39;s cheap. One could use ECMP groups to
    spread load to anycast server farms as you mentioned, and then use a software
    load-balancer to do the rest of the job. I&#39;d assume that&#39;d be much cheaper
    than 100K Vendor Hardware.

  html: Load balancers also monitor the service health of the destination server,
    so unless you integrate monitors into the controller then this isn&#39;t going
    to be easy at all. Maybe find a programmer to integrate OpenFlow into Linux HAproxy...<br
    /><br />Amazon must be doing something SDN-like for their ELB services, so it&#39;s
    an interesting question that someone out there has probably managed to do.<br
    /><br />In the real world it will be much easier (maybe cheaper too) to just install
    an F5/A10/Netscalar/HAproxy solution.<br />

    html: Nothing has changed in the last 2 years... apart from everyone moving from
      OpenFlow to the next shiny new thing.

  html: All these discussion had took place 2 years backs! So, now do we have any
    solutions for minimizing the latency ? has the limitations on theoretical part
    decreased ?
