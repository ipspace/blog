So no.. this can&#39;t be what is meant as &quot;flow-based forwarding&quot; this discussion?!<br /><br />Maybe what is meant is a &quot;flow/cache&quot; that&#39;s defining the full forwarding path - so only &quot;one&quot; router/control plane has to create a forwarding path(The forwarding decision only has to be made once regardless of the number of hops) for the flow to the destination.. like a virtual circuit.. perhaps I&#39;m talking gibberish.<br /><br />I&#39;m confused and intrigued at the same time.",

It is contrasted with destination forwarding as described in Section 8.2. If you look into G.809 that defines what is a flow and its related terminology, then you could see that flow-based forwarding is a kind of funny terminology. Because it has nothing to do with how the forwarding is done from the outside perspective. It just wants to emphasize a special way of internal optimization. But actually, it is still destination forwarding. Since a flow is defined as an aggregation of one or more traffic units with an element of common routing, the proper term could be &quot;flow-based routing&quot;. But not forwarding... <br />In fact, this confusion between forwarding and routing is reflected in all of the caching problems you have mentioned...",

Juniper&#39;s &quot;flow-based forwarding&quot; is a misnomer. It really is &quot;session-based forwarding.&quot;<br /><br />OpenFlow distorts it in a different direction by letting you customize which packet headers constitute a &quot;flow&quot; (i.e., a TCAM entry). Source-only, destination-only, source+dest L2/L3/L4, etc. OpenFlow would be more appropriately named OpenTCAM&quot;.",
