  html: All this sounds like the old switching methods as you mention. And Cisco&#39;s
    CEF was created as an improvement of fast-switching. But this isn&#39;t new. So
    no.. this can&#39;t be what is meant as &quot;flow-based forwarding&quot; this
    discussion?!<br /><br />Maybe what is meant is a &quot;flow/cache&quot; that&#39;s
    defining the full forwarding path - so only &quot;one&quot; router/control plane
    has to create a forwarding path(The forwarding decision only has to be made once
    regardless of the number of hops) for the flow to the destination.. like a virtual
    circuit.. perhaps I&#39;m talking gibberish.<br /><br />I&#39;m confused and intrigued
    at the same time.

  html: 'It sounds like we have a &#39;solution&#39; (loosely defined &#39;flow-based
    forwarding) and we are looking for a problem;)<br /><br />I would start with defining
    the problem and then talk about the solutions. Maybe following this path we could
    understand the originally cited &#39;flow-based forwarding&#39; superiority over
    regular forwarding;)<br /><br />Again, we are still talking about definition of
    the &#39;flow-based forwarding&#39; which actually may depend on marketing trends
    (&#39;coolness&#39; factor) '

  html: Flow-based forwarding sounds like what many firewalls already do with session
    tables. If a session is already established, it skips everything except the session
    lookup and sends the packet. This only works because firewalls keep state, whereas
    routers and switches do not, and arguably should not.

  html: Flow-based forwarding at the first sight looks like a kind of approximation
    of channel forwarding as defined in G.800 Section 8.1. It is contrasted with destination
    forwarding as described in Section 8.2. If you look into G.809 that defines what
    is a flow and its related terminology, then you could see that flow-based forwarding
    is a kind of funny terminology. Because it has nothing to do with how the forwarding
    is done from the outside perspective. It just wants to emphasize a special way
    of internal optimization. But actually, it is still destination forwarding. Since
    a flow is defined as an aggregation of one or more traffic units with an element
    of common routing, the proper term could be &quot;flow-based routing&quot;. But
    not forwarding... <br />In fact, this confusion between forwarding and routing
    is reflected in all of the caching problems you have mentioned...

  html: The definition I use is that a &quot;flow&quot; is <b>unidirectional</b> and
    <b>stateless</b> series of packets from a source to a destination. This is in
    keeping with Cisco NetFlow&#39;s definition which dates back to 1996 (see <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,243,667.PN.&amp;OS=PN/6,243,667&amp;RS=PN/6,243,667"
    rel="nofollow">US patent 6,243,667</a>).<br /><br />If you want bidirectional
    or stateful, then you&#39;ve got a &quot;session&quot; or &quot;connection.&quot;
    i.e., something that hates asymmetry. Juniper&#39;s &quot;flow-based forwarding&quot;
    is a misnomer. It really is &quot;session-based forwarding.&quot;<br /><br />OpenFlow
    distorts it in a different direction by letting you customize which packet headers
    constitute a &quot;flow&quot; (i.e., a TCAM entry). Source-only, destination-only,
    source+dest L2/L3/L4, etc. OpenFlow would be more appropriately named OpenTCAM&quot;.

  html: MLS? Did you mean MPLS?<br /><br />The vulnerability of cache-fast-path forwarding
    is not limited to routers/switches. My company handles several hundred Mbps of
    traffic coming from hundreds of millions of unique mobile devices. Our platform
    of choice is Illumos (Solaris), and its networking stack would melt down the kernel
    with excess memory utilization in the &quot;DCE cache&quot; (next-hop cache) because
    of the sheer number of entries in the cache.

    html: I don&#39;t think LISP is what you think it is ;) What you&#39;ve described
      is another proposal (probably Identifier-Locator Addressing; HIP might also
      be along these lines). LISP is tunneling with DNS-like tunnel endpoint discovery
      mechanism.

  html: 'The side comment about LISP being cache-based confuses me (Assuming LISP
    = Location/Identity separation). As I understood it, LISP is packet-by packet
    forwarding, but with core routers using 64 of the 128 bits of an IPv6 address
    as the destination address and ignoring the rest, and edge routes doing the reverse.
    This does not need any caching that I see (tough caching CAN be used, if anyone
    sees value in caching lookup results - same as any packet-based lookup-and-forward
    router).<br />What am I missing here? '

    html: For example, once you know that input/output ACLs permitted the first packet
      of a flow, there&#39;s no need to check the same ACLs for subsequent packets
      (modulo weird stuff like TCP flag checks or fragmentation checks etc.)

    /><br />Of course it was based on netflow TCAM, which was usually exhausted within
    a few seconds of activating any feature that depends on it on a box with any decent
    amount of traffic, but for low-bandwidth stuff it did work.<br /><br />I don&#39;t
    see any reason why modern NPs like Juniper Trio couldn&#39;t implement this...'

  html: Clearly this is an implementation of cache based forwarding, and optimising
    on the pipeline lookup stages &amp; follow on processing. This idea was also deployed
    by Tasman ISR, acquired by Nortel later (FYI a non-Cisco/Juniper product). <br
    />Nevertheless, a Openflow based switching pipeline can also benefit from a cache
    based early lookup and reduced inline service pipeline.(surely nobody IMO does
    it)<br />So technically the Juniper feature is not a flow based forwarding idea,  but
    a cache/netflow/sflow/tuple based forwarding pipeline optimisation. <br />Technically
    again this &#39;cache&#39; can be made out of a TCAM space, with match parameters
    and actions , so *internally* the Openflow semantics can be used to program the
    TCAM(if being used as a cache). Do recall that once the lookup fails in the TCAM
    space, the OF rules allows you to jump to legacy routing/switching pipeline.<br
    />A related concept is here ;<br />http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/a-radical-new-router/0<br
