      "html": "So basically marketing guys wrote the &quot;physical separation of the control from the data plane&quot; nonsense and now the people people with real-life networking experience have to &quot;redifine&quot; the definitions of control and data plane in context of SDN (where data plane includes control plane functions and control plane is actually a controller)? They could have just fixed the initial definition to make sense :) ",

You cannot kill the TCP/IP technology overnight. Managing it will remain the same, call it SDN, NMS or other.<br />Does SDN bring &quot;more programmability&quot;? More code? Who needs that? IF so, how does it simplify?<br />If not, what capabilities and visibility are missing in SDN?<br />Can anyone answer those?",
