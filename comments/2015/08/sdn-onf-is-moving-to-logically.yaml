  html: 'So basically marketing guys wrote the &quot;physical separation of the control
    from the data plane&quot; nonsense and now the people people with real-life networking
    experience have to &quot;redifine&quot; the definitions of control and data plane
    in context of SDN (where data plane includes control plane functions and control
    plane is actually a controller)? They could have just fixed the initial definition
    to make sense :) '

  html: The contributors are mentioned in the end of the ONF&#39;s document. And,
    surprisingly, there is nobody from Big Switch Networks :)

  html: 'We are in full agreement, as very often :)<br />People who have been building
    working and sustainable networks for long time know what it takes to do it properly.
    One can play politics and marketing for some time but when it comes to real deplyments,
    BS gets exposed rather quickly! '

  html: Very much appreciated, Ivan. We in the ONF architecture working group have
    been trying to get this more nuanced message out for quite a while now.

  html: When the NMS failed, they called it SDN. When collocation and off-premises
    hosting failed, they called it Cloud. IPv6 did not see the light due to several
    reasons. You cannot kill the TCP/IP technology overnight. Managing it will remain
    the same, call it SDN, NMS or other.<br />Does SDN bring &quot;more programmability&quot;?
    More code? Who needs that? IF so, how does it simplify?<br />If not, what capabilities
    and visibility are missing in SDN?<br />Can anyone answer those?

  html: Hi Ivan<br /><br />You blog opened my eyes!<br /><br /><br />For weeks I tried
    to understand what changes brings SDN (cloud and nfv as well) into architecture
    but without too much luck :)<br /><br />In my opinion all the new names, terms,
    products from vendors and OPEN things are a bit fake and only introduce confusion.<br
    /><br />Nevertheless I clearly see potential and usage for SDN, VNF and Cloud
    if deployed in a smart way.<br /><br />Michal<br /><br />PS <br />I thougt that
    you promote SDN Ivan ;)<br />
