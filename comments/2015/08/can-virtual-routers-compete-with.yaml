    html: Xeon+EZChip would be an awesome combo, particularly with modular OS on top
      of it (Cumulus comes to mind). We just need someone who wants to buy thousands
      of these boxes ;))<br /><br />As for Pluribus - if I got it right (and I have
      no idea, because they never got to the technical details in their Tech Field
      Day presentations), all they have in their proprietary hardware is extra 10GE
      lanes to the Xeon CPU, making it possible to do more than what you can squeeze
      on the PCI bus between Trident-2 and CPU. Obviously that advantage goes away
      the moment you deploy their SW on whitebox HW.

    html: Cumulus do seem best placed on the software side.<br /><br />For the hardware
      the best I&#39;ve seen is what I have in my personal lab, a 2 slot ATCA chassis
      with a Xeon box in one slot, and an EZchip based switch in the other. Of course
      this is all ancient kit, but current gen stuff does exist and is probably feasible.<br
      /><br />Shame there doesn&#39;t seem to be any vendors really looking to roll
      this up, would be a fun thing to build.

  html: Even more if you consider pps-per-tco$<br /><br />A recent (even five year
    old) asic-based vendor router is almost certainly using less power for the same
    traffic. This might not be as significant or matter that much if you don&#39;t
    need terabits of performance though.<br /><br />I do think it&#39;s a shame that
    there&#39;s not a vendor (at least that I&#39;m aware of) making a box which is
    a nice Xeon server with a fully-plumbed EZchip (one of the higher end ones capable
    of doing internet scale routing) with a decent SW plumbing layer on top. The software
    to do useful carrier internet routing on linux is finally getting complete enough
    you could consider deploying it.<br /><br />The pluribus ones come closest of
    those I&#39;m aware of, but have the downside of a second switch chip, and needing
    to run their OS.

    html: Agreed on both counts. However:<br /><br />* If you want to have reliable
      NFV deployment, you _SHOULD_ deploy VNFs (fancy names for VMs) on dedicated
      infrastructure and carefully manage the oversubscription;<br /><br />* While
      software-based forwarding always incurs more latency than hardware-based forwarding,
      I don&#39;t think it matters then moment the traffic hits the first WAN link.

    html: The latency impact will be mostly felt when Virtual Router is handling local
      traffic that didn&#39;t originate or terminate into VMs. One has to be careful
      to consider which flows will traverse the VR when replacing physical with virtual.
      Virtualized environments are generally not great with handling of tasks that
      require real-time scheduling.<br /><br />And for the sake of example, Juniper
      VSRX (Firefly) adds latency of 5-10 ms on very light loads. E.g. if it serves
      some lonely VoIP call late at night, quality will suffer.

    html: 5-10 msec latency just for traversing a VM is ridiculous, and has (IMHO)
      nothing to do with virtualization and all to do with suboptimal implementations.<br
      /><br />Thanks for the data point - it will definitely come handy ;)<br />Ivan

  html: Hosting routers on VM poses the same risks as doing any other things in a
    shared resource environment. I&#39;ve seen one VM influencing performance and
    causing network interruptions to other VMs on the same hypervisor. Also latency
    is generally higher in case of VM routers.

  html: With regards to SSL termination... &quot;openssl speed rsa2048&quot; does
    829 private-key ops (equivalent to RSA sig) per core per second on my 3-year-old
    laptop.<br /><br />So, let&#39;s round and guess 1500 *new* TLS connections per
    core per second on a modern server. Modern Xeon servers have at least 16 cores...<br
    /><br />Any application that is connecting and disconnecting that frequently is
    broken by design. The user experience would be terrible even without TLS overhead.
    Use keep-alive connections for HTTP, along with session resumption, and it really
    isn&#39;t a problem.<br /><br />We run a mid-size SaaS application doing SSL termination
    on just four Xeon cores spread across two load balancing nginx instances. They
    hover around 15%, and that includes handshakes and bulk crypto.<br /><br />CloudFlare,
    Google, Faceboox, etc. do NOT use hardware for SSL acceleration, because it just
    doesn&#39;t matter if you have HTTP keep-alive and session cache/ticketing enabled.
    I believe Google said turning on SSL increased their front-end server load by
    something like 2-3% overall.

  html: Two key things are AES-NI support in processor and modern TLS library that
    has good support for AES-NI. Without either of those, you&#39;re in slow train.
