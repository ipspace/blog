    html: Well, the title was a bit tongue-in-cheek ;)<br /><br />On a more serious
      note, I do think that all the BS that is circulating around does more harm to
      SDN than anything else (including ideas that are obviously faulty like &quot;centralized
      control plane&quot;), particularly if it&#39;s propagated by people who are
      supposed to know better.<br /><br />For more insightful content, do browse my
      other SDN-related posts. There are currently almost 230 of them and I&#39;m
      positive you&#39;ll find one or two interesting.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br
      />Ivan

  html: Not sure i understand why the post is titled &quot;The biggest Problem of
    SDN&quot;. I was looking at something really insightful. What i found instead
    was a general rant on how clueless some folks are when they speak about SDN --
    This really isnt a problem of SDN. Would you agree?

  html: LinkedIn reminds me of Internet in the late 90&#39;s - early 00&#39;s when
    it was finally reaching the broader audience and before spam filters were invented
    - when anyone could just send any email to anyone else or join a mailing group
    and start spamming there and no one wanted to do anything about it. Good articles
    on LinkedIN are like rare gems amongst a sh*tstorm of marketing fud, recruiter
    ads and pandemic new job congratulations. i feel like going there and endorsing
    someone for their &#39;IP&#39; skill.

    html: That would make way more sense, but unfortunately that doesn&#39;t seem
      to be where most controller development effort is spent.
