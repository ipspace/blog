What&#39;s more is that I&#39;ve found my experience in teaching others has helped me in landing higher-level positions where they want/require you to mentor more junior engineers.  So you&#39;re not only forcing yourself to learn technology, you&#39;re giving yourself yet another valuable skill.",

Boning up to teach something is a surefire motivator to make yourself an expert on said topic, because you don&#39;t want to end up looking like an idiot in front of your colleagues.<br /><br />;&gt;",

Even spending just 15-30 minutes a day (on average) learning something new during working hours will have profound effects over time - again like you said - compound interest - or in this case, compound expertise or compound skills overtime.<br /><br />I am only 10 years into my career, but, following a similar path to you, and looking forward to follow a similar path :)",

Most recently with all the huge industry focus on datacenters, &#39;cloud&#39; , &#39;sdn&#39; ... I have followed your blog and have to really thank you as you are one of the industry&#39;s lighthouses, someone who is able to once again, make sense out of all this universe of new terms and rubbish buzzwords and still focus on the fundamentals/ basics. I very seldom provide my opinion in blogs etc, but felt compelled after reading your latest posts to stop by and really thank you for being one of the industry&#39;s anchorpoints on these days where everything seems so fluid and ethereal.",
