There are currently almost 230 of them and I&#39;m positive you&#39;ll find one or two interesting.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Ivan",

Good articles on LinkedIN are like rare gems amongst a sh*tstorm of marketing fud, recruiter ads and pandemic new job congratulations. i feel like going there and endorsing someone for their &#39;IP&#39; skill.",
