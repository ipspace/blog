Everything is drama because every project assumes that network will solve the issues of badly written code. Everything is drama because every time a new piece of complicated infrastructure is put in place to resolve bad code, it makes thing more likely to fail. Everything is drama because, as Ivan often points out, the network is not like utilities, because if it was, none of these applications would work.<br /><br />The network is expected to be something that is simple and efficient, but at the same time provide all sorts of services and nerd knobs that points in the other direction.

I have seen the poorly written applications and the network was blamed and have had to prove otherwise, many times. It is true yes the network WAS the utility but has become more complex to change with the business and as a noted IP author mentioned in an SDN video &quot;the network is in the way&quot; is what enterprises view it as.<br /><br /> As a network vet of almost 30 years I heard the old mantra of IT has to become part of the business, not an expense, the network group has to become part of the business not an expense. Here is the kicker, maybe at this point in time some enterprises and network groups see SDN as that opportunity for the network team to become part of the business(with the developers etc) to help grow and guide the business and not just as another expense. However, there are some who will see SDN as the opportunity to remove/marginalize the network group or reduce that level of &quot;in your way&quot; or &quot;expense&quot; . Obviously there is no one size that fits all.",

We all know that management needs to change stuff, or they&#39;re not doing their job, execs need new ideas on how they are going to cut costs and make more money to give to the media so their companies share price goes up. <br /><br />Server admins/windows admins/and omg wtf are you thinking software developers running the network is laughable...I literally start LOL as soon as I even think about this!  I&#39;ve been hired to fix simple networks with just a few switches and a firewall or router that a server guy did and screwed up...I can&#39;t even imagine a complex DC or WAN environment that has multiple overlay networks running on top of it.  Even if they had a tool that builds it automatically what&#39;s going to happen when something breaks, and they need to troubleshoot networks on top of networks, that ride over the actual network (GRE or VXLAN over MPLS over L2/L3 network).

Have i missed something fundamental?  should i go back and read my CCNx books?  I just dont get it.  It just feels like another layer to work with and another set of workarounds to my broken apps...",
