    html: Don&#39;t forget that Netflix runs some pretty unusual load - all they do
      is transfer data from memory (or disk) to network. <br /><br />Most web sites
      spend orders of magnitude more time on processing data, so the SSL overhead
      becomes negligible.

    html: I am in violent agreement. TCP_sendfile optimizations only help when you
      serve tons of large-fle static content; most sites do not.<br /><br />Engineers
      should always test and measure rather than blindly follow the lore of the Interwebs.
      <br /><br />We used sample testing in production to roll out TLS for our streaming
      video, increasing the percentage every day. We never noticed any detectable
      increase in server CPU or end-user response time metrics. We&#39;re clearly
      not Netflix, but video is about 70% of traffic by volume.<br /><br />Most data
      centers have CPU capacity to burn anyway.

    html: 'The netflix argument is a boogeyman edge case. The hit from TLS is nowhere
      near 50% for anyone but Netflix.<br /><br />Googke observed a 1% CPU hit and
      a 2% bandwidth hit rolling out TLS for everything. They needed no new server
      hardware, much less custom ASICs.<br /><br />Source: http://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/06/25/overclocking-ssl.html<br
      /><br />For the SaaS company I work for, we also could not measure the impact
      of enabling TLS for everything on our existing VM-based infrastructure.'

  html: Netflix did some analysis of this (https://people.freebsd.org/~rrs/asiabsd_2015_tls.pdf)
    and while there continue to be improvements with SSL, with a 53% capacity hit
    it can require twice as many resources as unencrypted service.  That&#39;s probably
    not an issue for small sites, but a measureable (and cost) issue for larger sites.

  html: 'All the arguments are driven by price performance metrics. With 50% overhead
    for SSL in https/http  there, Firecloud SSL termination for masses also will be  dependent
    on price/performance metric of the service. '

  html: 'I ran across another article supporting this notion: hardware HSMs are not
    much faster than OpenSSL for most practical use cases, and drastically increase
    cost and complexity. <br />https://jimshaver.net/2015/04/24/openssl-vs-hsm-performance/<br
    />So unless you&#39;re willing/forced to go down the &quot;private keys are only
    ever in the HSM&quot; route, and pipe all of your traffic through the system that
    has the HSM, just use OpenSSL (or a modern version of IIS, as the Windows CryptoAPI
    seem to be almost as fast as OpenSSL).'
