TCP_sendfile optimizations only help when you serve tons of large-fle static content; most sites do not.<br /><br />Engineers should always test and measure rather than blindly follow the lore of the Interwebs. <br /><br />We used sample testing in production to roll out TLS for our streaming video, increasing the percentage every day. We never noticed any detectable increase in server CPU or end-user response time metrics. We&#39;re clearly not Netflix, but video is about 70% of traffic by volume.<br /><br />Most data centers have CPU capacity to burn anyway.",

The hit from TLS is nowhere near 50% for anyone but Netflix.<br /><br />Googke observed a 1% CPU hit and a 2% bandwidth hit rolling out TLS for everything. They needed no new server hardware, much less custom ASICs.<br /><br />Source: http://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/06/25/overclocking-ssl.html<br /><br />For the SaaS company I work for, we also could not measure the impact of enabling TLS for everything on our existing VM-based infrastructure.",

That&#39;s probably not an issue for small sites, but a measureable (and cost) issue for larger sites.",
