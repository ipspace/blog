    html: You wouldn&#39;t believe how many people pull all the Internet traffic through
      the central BFF (Big Fat Firewall) instead of using local Internet exit ;)

    html: 'Surely it&#39;s a massive issue to manage and control the ACLs on the local
      internet access routers (As surely a FW at each site is not realistic) with
      existing tools at any kind of scale? And that&#39;s before you even consider
      internet access being policy based rather than just unhindered outbound 80/443.<br
      /><br />I &quot;own&quot; a 300+ site WAN with your central BFF exit providing
      direct access for very specific use cases with general internet access via Proxy
      (McAfee) that enables AD group linked policy control so fairly painless once
      up and running. <br /><br />I know there are cloud based proxy services (Our
      laptops drop back to that control when off the corporate network) but the controls
      are significantly less fine grained. <br /><br />Just feels like I am missing
      something or people running that model have made comprises I&#39;m thinking
      of as deal breakers? '

    html: The reason for not using local Internet exit isn&#39;t the firewall (in
      my experience anyway), it&#39;s the proxy server. I haven&#39;t a full-featured
      cloud-based proxy server at any price (say, something that compares feature-for-feature
      to Cisco WSA; Cisco&#39;s own cloud proxy doesn&#39;t), and the non-comparing
      ones are already overpriced.

    html: To be fair, this &quot;everything is drama&quot; thing didn&#39;t come up
      out of thin air. Everything is drama because it is typical that nobody talk
      to the network until 4pm on Friday for a midnight implementation of an app that
      requires major network work. Everything is drama because every project assumes
      that network will solve the issues of badly written code. Everything is drama
      because every time a new piece of complicated infrastructure is put in place
      to resolve bad code, it makes thing more likely to fail. Everything is drama
      because, as Ivan often points out, the network is not like utilities, because
      if it was, none of these applications would work.<br /><br />The network is
      expected to be something that is simple and efficient, but at the same time
      provide all sorts of services and nerd knobs that points in the other direction.
      Those things don&#39;t mesh. That&#39;s why everything is drama.

    html: I agree with you Simon there too. I have been in the debates of &quot; Do
      you architect your network around your application or architect the application
      around the network&quot;. I have seen the poorly written applications and the
      network was blamed and have had to prove otherwise, many times. It is true yes
      the network WAS the utility but has become more complex to change with the business
      and as a noted IP author mentioned in an SDN video &quot;the network is in the
      way&quot; is what enterprises view it as.<br /><br /> As a network vet of almost
      30 years I heard the old mantra of IT has to become part of the business, not
      an expense, the network group has to become part of the business not an expense.
      Here is the kicker, maybe at this point in time some enterprises and network
      groups see SDN as that opportunity for the network team to become part of the
      business(with the developers etc) to help grow and guide the business and not
      just as another expense. However, there are some who will see SDN as the opportunity
      to remove/marginalize the network group or reduce that level of &quot;in your
      way&quot; or &quot;expense&quot; . Obviously there is no one size that fits
      all.

  html: Perimeter FW or even distributed virtual perimeter concept vs. many local
    logical FW concepts is the debate today.<br /><br />I agree with your post though.
    However, having been to many IT shops there are some where, I hate to say it,
    the network group acts like a good fellas gang and they are very difficult to
    work with the rest of the organization(everything is drama). Now in my travels
    this is the very exception but once in a while I encounter one group like this
    and I wonder if on the broader scale if this is becoming the norm. Thus, no wonder
    the enterprise want&#39;s to marginalize the network dept. away and move it to
    the developers for more control and cooperation and SDN is the dust to do it.
    Just an observation.

  html: I don&#39;t know if SDN is a solution to real-life enterprise problems but
    there is a need for change.  The cost to acquire and manage server and storage
    architectures has declined over time while networking stays stubbornly expensive.  Maybe
    it&#39;s because a network engineer has to deal with no less than five different
    OS, CLI, and management platforms to deal with ever-changing application requirements.  SDN
    is attempting to standardize all of this into a single programmable architecture.

    html: '@Ivan, SDN may not solve stupidity but it does, to some degree, solve the
      &quot;fat finger&quot; issue.  Some SDN solutions automatically configure interface
      characteristics (we all know that) and at the same time self label, so that
      vSwitch connected to the vNIC/pNIC labels the physical interface on the device
      and at the SDN controller.  All  learnt and discovered through automation..   This
      isn&#39;t earth shattering, but it is a step in the right direction. '

  html: SDN will give more control and flexibility over the network to the customer/user/network-admin.
    They will be able to program their equipment themselves, they will be able to
    tweak routing algorithms in the central controller. They get APIs to hook into
    the heart of the intelligence. They get more config-knobs. It&#39;s gonna be awesome.<br
    /><br />However, if you truly want to prevent what happened at UA, the exact opposite
    is needed. Less config. Less knobs. Less tweaks. Less &quot;smart stuff&quot;
    invented by indivuals or indivual customers.<br /><br />What you want is equipment
    that doesn&#39;t need any configuration. So nobody can make mistakes. Or at most
    very very minimal configuration. In stead of thinking how you can add more configuration
    options, protocols and knobs, the industry should try to *remove* as many config
    commands as necessary.<br /><br />Network engineers do a lot of smart stuff in
    their networks. I am convinced that some &quot;AI&quot; (just some smart algorithms)
    could do a better job. Is it necessary to configure all those time-out values
    ? Or could a router determine what the best value would be ? I bet half the configuration
    commands in today&#39;s routers could be removed.
