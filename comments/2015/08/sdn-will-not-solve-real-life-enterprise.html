            <div class="comment-content">Surely it&#39;s a massive issue to manage and control the ACLs on the local internet access routers (As surely a FW at each site is not realistic) with existing tools at any kind of scale? And that&#39;s before you even consider internet access being policy based rather than just unhindered outbound 80/443.<br /><br />I &quot;own&quot; a 300+ site WAN with your central BFF exit providing direct access for very specific use cases with general internet access via Proxy (McAfee) that enables AD group linked policy control so fairly painless once up and running. <br /><br />I know there are cloud based proxy services (Our laptops drop back to that control when off the corporate network) but the controls are significantly less fine grained. <br /><br />Just feels like I am missing something or people running that model have made comprises I&#39;m thinking of as deal breakers? </div>

            <div class="comment-content">The reason for not using local Internet exit isn&#39;t the firewall (in my experience anyway), it&#39;s the proxy server. I haven&#39;t a full-featured cloud-based proxy server at any price (say, something that compares feature-for-feature to Cisco WSA; Cisco&#39;s own cloud proxy doesn&#39;t), and the non-comparing ones are already overpriced.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Perimeter FW or even distributed virtual perimeter concept vs. many local logical FW concepts is the debate today.<br /><br />I agree with your post though. However, having been to many IT shops there are some where, I hate to say it, the network group acts like a good fellas gang and they are very difficult to work with the rest of the organization(everything is drama). Now in my travels this is the very exception but once in a while I encounter one group like this and I wonder if on the broader scale if this is becoming the norm. Thus, no wonder the enterprise want&#39;s to marginalize the network dept. away and move it to the developers for more control and cooperation and SDN is the dust to do it. Just an observation.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">To be fair, this &quot;everything is drama&quot; thing didn&#39;t come up out of thin air. Everything is drama because it is typical that nobody talk to the network until 4pm on Friday for a midnight implementation of an app that requires major network work. Everything is drama because every project assumes that network will solve the issues of badly written code. Everything is drama because every time a new piece of complicated infrastructure is put in place to resolve bad code, it makes thing more likely to fail. Everything is drama because, as Ivan often points out, the network is not like utilities, because if it was, none of these applications would work.<br /><br />The network is expected to be something that is simple and efficient, but at the same time provide all sorts of services and nerd knobs that points in the other direction. Those things don&#39;t mesh. That&#39;s why everything is drama.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I agree with you Simon there too. I have been in the debates of &quot; Do you architect your network around your application or architect the application around the network&quot;. I have seen the poorly written applications and the network was blamed and have had to prove otherwise, many times. It is true yes the network WAS the utility but has become more complex to change with the business and as a noted IP author mentioned in an SDN video &quot;the network is in the way&quot; is what enterprises view it as.<br /><br /> As a network vet of almost 30 years I heard the old mantra of IT has to become part of the business, not an expense, the network group has to become part of the business not an expense. Here is the kicker, maybe at this point in time some enterprises and network groups see SDN as that opportunity for the network team to become part of the business(with the developers etc) to help grow and guide the business and not just as another expense. However, there are some who will see SDN as the opportunity to remove/marginalize the network group or reduce that level of &quot;in your way&quot; or &quot;expense&quot; . Obviously there is no one size that fits all.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I don&#39;t know if SDN is a solution to real-life enterprise problems but there is a need for change.  The cost to acquire and manage server and storage architectures has declined over time while networking stays stubbornly expensive.  Maybe it&#39;s because a network engineer has to deal with no less than five different OS, CLI, and management platforms to deal with ever-changing application requirements.  SDN is attempting to standardize all of this into a single programmable architecture.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">@Ivan, SDN may not solve stupidity but it does, to some degree, solve the &quot;fat finger&quot; issue.  Some SDN solutions automatically configure interface characteristics (we all know that) and at the same time self label, so that vSwitch connected to the vNIC/pNIC labels the physical interface on the device and at the SDN controller.  All  learnt and discovered through automation..   This isn&#39;t earth shattering, but it is a step in the right direction. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">SDN will give more control and flexibility over the network to the customer/user/network-admin. They will be able to program their equipment themselves, they will be able to tweak routing algorithms in the central controller. They get APIs to hook into the heart of the intelligence. They get more config-knobs. It&#39;s gonna be awesome.<br /><br />However, if you truly want to prevent what happened at UA, the exact opposite is needed. Less config. Less knobs. Less tweaks. Less &quot;smart stuff&quot; invented by indivuals or indivual customers.<br /><br />What you want is equipment that doesn&#39;t need any configuration. So nobody can make mistakes. Or at most very very minimal configuration. In stead of thinking how you can add more configuration options, protocols and knobs, the industry should try to *remove* as many config commands as necessary.<br /><br />Network engineers do a lot of smart stuff in their networks. I am convinced that some &quot;AI&quot; (just some smart algorithms) could do a better job. Is it necessary to configure all those time-out values ? Or could a router determine what the best value would be ? I bet half the configuration commands in today&#39;s routers could be removed.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I don&#39;t know that it is a good thing if we have network engineers or your average dev &quot;tweaking&quot; routing algorithms. I know my own coding skills are severely eroded and none of our devs understand networking at all.<br /><br />Currently routing protocols, in my opinions, are well-behaved and robust, and have evolved more or less organically. I&#39;m sure quite a few sdn solutions use them under the hood too. </div>

Sarcasm on the Internet never works, unless you use a lot of emoticons. I forgot. I don&#39;t believe that many companies will have the time, money, expertise or confidence to truly program their equipment. And the ones that will attempt will run into some real troubles, if not only because of &quot;fat fingers&quot;.</div>

We all know that management needs to change stuff, or they&#39;re not doing their job, execs need new ideas on how they are going to cut costs and make more money to give to the media so their companies share price goes up. <br /><br />Server admins/windows admins/and omg wtf are you thinking software developers running the network is laughable...I literally start LOL as soon as I even think about this!  I&#39;ve been hired to fix simple networks with just a few switches and a firewall or router that a server guy did and screwed up...I can&#39;t even imagine a complex DC or WAN environment that has multiple overlay networks running on top of it.  Even if they had a tool that builds it automatically what&#39;s going to happen when something breaks, and they need to troubleshoot networks on top of networks, that ride over the actual network (GRE or VXLAN over MPLS over L2/L3 network). </div>

It all started with a few huge cloud service providers trying to (A) get features custom-written for their environment or (B) squeeze suppliers&#39;  margins.

            <div class="comment-content">Im probably missing the point here, and maybe have totally misunderstood the whole SDN thing (dont get me wrong, i understand how wonderful its going to be having SDN magic datacentres and glorious pixie dust IWANs), but I still dont understand how SDN is going to fix the plethora of broken applications I work with day in day out?  Have i missed something fundamental?  should i go back and read my CCNx books?  I just dont get it.  It just feels like another layer to work with and another set of workarounds to my broken apps...</div>
