    html: With CloudFlare, Akamai and a number of other CDN providers offering 6-to-4
      translation service, these excuses become totally lame.<br /><br />As for AWS,
      they started offering IPv6 on the outside years ago. Getting IPv6 running on
      the inside will take quite a while, as they do routing in their custom virtual
      switch.

  html: '&quot;We still have time to implement IPv6&quot; and &quot;Our provider does
    not support IPv6&quot; was what I got when I asked for IPv6 for two popular websites
    (see http://blog.quux.de/?p=1893 and http://blog.quux.de/?p=1898).<br /><br />Looks
    like many of the big cloud providers have no or only limited IPv6 support.IIRC
    there was a longer discussion about aws and IPv6 on the nanog mailing list earlier
    this year. '

    html: Oh no, not again... did anyone take a look at the calendar lately?<br /><br
      />SCE, ACE, vASA, IronPort, Nexus 5500, Nexus 1000V, ACI... will it never end?
      At least they fixed some of these products (and killed a few others).

  html: Is Cisco Meraki still considered a Startup? ;-)<br />But for sure, they will
    also suport IPv6 eventually .. (hopefully)
