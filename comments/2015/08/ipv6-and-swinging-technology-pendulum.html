            <div class="comment-content">A lot of the blame goes to the designers of the networking APIs in BSD Unix in the early 1980s, though how could they have known that their designs would live for so long. And then I and my colleagues in the WinSock cabal compounded the problem by slavishly following the BSD model in creating the network APIs for Windows. But our main objective was to unify a fragmented market; we weren&#39;t thinking of the future. Mea culpa.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Geoff!<br /><br />Thanks for dropping by and leaving a comment! It&#39;s a true honor to have you as one of my occasional readers.<br /><br />I don&#39;t blame the designers of BSD/WinSock API. It&#39;s evident the Socket API was v0.1, DNS was still on the drawing board when they released it, and those were the heady times of quick-and-dirty solutions that gave us headaches like FTP and SMTP.<br /><br />The real blame should fall on IESG that didn&#39;t push hard enough for higher-layer changes in mid-1990s when they embraced the IPng proposal. Looping through a set of network-layer addresses in application code is so obviously a broken abstraction (or maybe it&#39;s just the 20-20 hindsight ;).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Isn&#39;t it time to just finally admit that IPv6 isn&#39;t fit for purpose &amp; redesign again this time inviting network types and other interested parties to join the discussion?<br />IPv6 looks like IETF / ieee got jealous of IPv4 stealing the show and wanted to show off how they could do it better whilst ignoring anyone with an interest in it.<br />I believe IPv6 is fundamentaly flawed, from privacy concerns to the incomprehensible addressing scheme (i understand the reasons for using a hex numbered dotted notation, but is confiusing for non network types &amp; connecting to those new IoT devices at home will be a pain when its IP is 128 characters, a home dns server would make life easier) to the massive over allocation of addressing (who needs a /64 at home).<br />Enterprises with the skill, money, resources and motivation are dragging their heals on this adoption.<br />Home users with an increasing number of intra/inter connected devices and a basic router will suddenly find limitations or device name conflicts in the ipv6 world.</div>
