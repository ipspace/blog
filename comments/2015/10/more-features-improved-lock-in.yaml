    html: Thank you. My &quot;black &amp; white&quot; perspective hit me again...
      Fixed.

    html: You&#39;re right - and I fixed the &quot;proprietary&quot; part. However,
      &quot;implement it on your own RDBMS&quot; part shows we live in rather different
      realities.<br /><br />BTW, I did implement my own RDBMS once and got it into
      production, so I know a bit what I&#39;m talking about. Did you?

    html: Why would I do that since I can just use BSD-licensed, fee-free PostgreSQL?
      A waste of time unless you want to study RDBMSes on your own. But have my congratulations
      that you did it on your own, impressive.<br /><br />What I mean - since you
      have the code available, license-free, why don&#39;t you give that to your company
      programers and ask for similar algorithm in your product? Sorry but I don&#39;t
      understand the &quot;different realities&quot; part - why do you think it&#39;s
      impossible?

  html: How is this &#39;proprietary&#39;? Just read the code (BSD licensed...) and
    implement it on your own in your own RDBMS. No license fee needed.<br /><br />EIGRP
    is proprietary. EIGRP is vendor lock-in.

    html: ' Q. What is Cisco releasing?<br />A. Cisco is releasing the basic EIGRP
      to the IETF as an Informational RFC. This includes all the information needed
      to implement EIGRP, and its associated features, including High Availability
      (HA). <br /><br />So you lack more advanced EIGRP functionalities. To little,
      to late.'

  html: 'Perhaps by studying the history of server operating systems over the last
    30 years, and the transition from vertically integrated servers first with proprietary
    operating systems (IBM mainframes, VMS, etc), then with proprietary integrations
    of open source (Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, etc), and in the end to disaggregated software
    (Linux, Windows Server) we can see that it is far cheaper per-unit to do the software
    once than it is to replicate hundreds of millions of dollars per year of R&amp;D
    at every hardware vendor... <br /><br />Will leave it as an exercise for the reader
    to think through the industry structure under which the customers benefit from
    the industry only doing the software once.  Hint: a single vendor who maximizes
    marginal revenue (that&#39;s a college level economics textbook phrase) is not
    that structure.'

    html: I could say the same thing about &quot;claiming you can&#39;t be locked
      into an open-source product&quot;. The proof is left as an exercise for the
      interested reader.

    html: Actually, while you can lock yourself into any product, including OSS, with
      OSS you can always find and switch to alternatives, so the lock-in isn&#39;t
      really a problem. If you spend a 6 figure sum of money to deploy openstack and
      use it organization wide, you are effectively locked into it indeed, because
      switching to something else, would mean another huge expense. There is, however,
      no lock-in in terms of integrations, whom you choose to get support from etc.
      Compare that to Oracle for example, who try real hard to lock you into their
      own OS, hardware and application stack, by declining support for anything else
      and you&#39;ll see the difference between vendor lock-in and what I would call
      tech-oriented self lock-in.

  html: 'Claiming an opensource product introduces lock-in and is proprietary is rather
    dumb, didn&#39;t expect to see such a thing here. Don&#39;t believe me - just
