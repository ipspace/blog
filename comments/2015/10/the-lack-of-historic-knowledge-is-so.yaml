  html: This totally makes sense, however I can understand engineers who don&#39;t
    want to spend time studying technologies they will probably never use.. The networking
    world is so wide that you have to select some techs to focus on..

  html: For us coming from the CCIE world, everyone was raging about why Frame Relay
    was kept for so long. While not used any longer in most parts of the world, it
    did teach the concepts of NBMA. Something that is critical when working with DMVPN.
    Also, FR has some similar concepts to MPLS, making the gap to learn MPLS a bit
    lower.<br /><br />While I&#39;ve never touched Decnet, Appletalk or IPX (except
    on home PC) I try to keep aware of what existed in the past. Even I can see that
    history is repeating itself and many of the SDN startups are repeating the most
    basic mistakes of the past...

    html: ATDT - priceless ;)) Thanks for bringing this up!<br /><br />Now that I
      think about that, I started with ATDP :D... and I&#39;m positive there&#39;s
      AT command set hidden within every 3G modem (in the good old days you could
      use it to send SMS messages).

      AT commands to control GSM modem. It&#39;s really coll that this has not changed
      over the years.<br />

    tech support.<br /><br />(PSTN is still more reliable than 3G for OOB, assuming
    you test it often - anybody got a good automated test script?).

  html: As a 27 year old network (and systems, unfortunately) engineer, I am very
    interested in older/obsolete technologies. I think they&#39;re really cool and
    obviously still relevant even though no one uses them anymore. I do, however,
    not have the time to study them. At work I barely have time for current technologies,
    and outside of work... well let&#39;s just say I do my best to stay away from
    enterprise IT stuff. I care too much about my mental health ;)

  html: My son is studying computer science and during his networking classes he is
    overwhelmed by the number of technologies used in the past. For me it&#39;s easy
    to describe them because I started playing with ARCNET. BUT I am not surprised
    that someone might find it difficult (impractical) to study the past just because
    it is huge amount of knowledge...

      is that we have good-enough approximations that get results in reasonable time.

  html: Do I understand correctly that you consider MPLS Traffic Engineering a failed
    technology ? If so, I&#39;d love to see a post by you explaining why.<br /><br
    />I thought MPLS TE did the right things ? It aggregates small flows into very
    big flows. The tunnels are set up only once, not dynamically based on traffic.
    You configure tunnels only where you need them, not everywhere in the network.
    It got deployed. So why did it fail ? Did people stop using it ? Is it too complex
    to configure ? To troubleshoot ? Not worth the effort ? Curious.

    html: If, however, you have sound fundamental knowledge, it&#39;s much easier
      to deal with &quot;so much to learn&quot; because it&#39;s mostly reinvented
      old stuff.<br /><br />You either invest in learning about the old failures,
      or learn the hard way why that old stuff failed (without ever realizing the
      significance of that failure) when the shiny new stuff breaks down ;)

      fail at the fundamental level, I took myself the opposite approach, going back
      for the fundamentals and ask yourself as much as you can how it works everything.

  html: Maybe it&#39;s time to challenge your own belief on what a failure actually
    is. Is it truly a mistake or just an old link in a chain this is still evolving?
    I know there are ignorant people out there, but SDN is not just a big repeat of
    historical mistakes. This is something that has been progressing for awhile now,
    terminology and marketing lingo aside.

    html: Hi Ian,<br /><br />We could easily start listing great ideas, from CLNS
      per-host addressing (I still think it was a good idea) and OSI session layer
      (see http://blog.ipspace.net/2009/08/what-went-wrong-tcpip-lacks-session.html)
      to VAX/VMS operating system or Digital&#39;s RDB database or Banyan Vines directory
      service... but that wasn&#39;t the point.<br /><br />I am positive that all
      things I listed on that slide deserve to be there, and I could add a few more
      (like X.25). Some of them were successful because they solved problems we don&#39;t
      have anymore (very high error rate) or problems people thought needed solving
      (ATM QoS). <br /><br />In any case, we should understand what their shortcomings
      were, so that when someone tries to reinvent the technologies we don&#39;t have
      to rediscover the shortcomings. Agreed?<br /><br />As for the &quot;lessons
      learned&quot;, I would love to hear counter-arguments.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br
      />Ivan

    html: 'Agreed.  More of a blanket statement than any pointed issue with your list
      of failures.<br /><br />Lessons learned...  I think that #1 and #3 would be
      essentially semantic arguments and, while they might make for a wonderful conversation
      at the bar, are not terribly interesting on the Internet ( define &quot;scale&quot;
      in flow-based systems, for example ).  So let&#39;s talk about #2.<br /><br
      />There are semantics in play here as well, but I submit that the most evident
      reason hop-by-hop fails that I have encountered is the complexities involved
      in device administration rather and information security than in any inherent
      technical shortcoming in the _idea_ that all the information needed for forwarding
      is carried within the packet.  Following instructions in a label or header is
      simple, making sure that the rules about what that label or header _mean_ to
      the follower are consistent and trustworthy is hard.<br /><br />So, while there
      is a long and not particularly distinguished list of failed attempts to do this,
      the ones that I can think of failed because we weren&#39;t ready with the security
      and administration apparatus, not because they didn&#39;t actually work well
      or scale well.<br /><br />And, on the flip side, by using path based forwarding
      to defer dealing with those security and administration shortfalls we just kicked
      the can down the road for a generation.  <br /><br />Now we have examples of
      how to do ad-hoc tamper prevention and hyper-scale distributed node administration
      in real world situations, so it is perhaps reasonable that you could, for example,
      actually use IPv6+AH+hop-by-hop options and expect it would work. That is something
      of an ideal world argument, because it wouldn&#39;t work at all because we&#39;ve
      all set our devices to ignore options because we can barely agree on how to
      propagate routes in a trustworthy and non-destructive manner, much less how
      to trust the rich end of the IP header.  <br /><br />My point is that calling
      one better than the other is subjective when the &quot;better&quot; created
      a culture that is so afraid of a problem that they reject the solution. '

  html: 'While I generally agree with you, as an armchair historian of technology
    I&#39;d also point out that there many examples of &quot;good&quot; ideas that
    failed because they didn&#39;t work on their day&#39;s compute / memory / network
    that would likely work fine today.  And that what &quot;won&quot; many times did
    because it was good enough not because it was better than it&#39;s competition
    but because of externalities like price or access to code or presence/absence
    of proprietary ecosystem.  Things that certainly matter but don&#39;t really inform
    us about how to make good architectural decisions.<br /><br />Just because something
    failed commercially doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that what we should learn from
    that failure is that the technique itself was flawed.  I could probably form cogent
    arguments with each of your lessons learned as to why that lesson should be unlearned
    if I were in the mood to be a cantankerous old man. '

    was the network lpar one each with centralised control i.e vtam/ncp, one command
    and all the control moved from one site to the other non-disruptively. SDN is
    just old ideas recycled

    via &quot;partnership&quot; between education institutions and vendors in many

    I remember having a little BBS in 1989 using some BBS SW called pirate or black
    beard or something like that for my Novell and Token-Ring customers to dial in
    and obtain the latest desktop drivers for IPX and IBM NICs etc.  I love the analogies
    on the older tech and SDN. Especially IntServ... You Nailed it Ivan.

    html: That&#39;s funny, and true, to a certain extent - but the fundamental issue
      is that no matter how much you read and study up on this stuff, there&#39;s
      a huge chasm between abstract understanding and the hardcore, essential operational
      and architectural understanding gained from actually being forced to implement
      these technologies, watch them break in interesting and unexpected ways, and
      then be forced to fix them, on the fly.<br /><br />The situation with networking
      technologies today is highly analogous to the situation with automobile mechanics
      - it&#39;s only a tiny, shrinking percentage of aging practitioners who actually
      understand how the stuff works, the rest are just break/fix &#39;technicians&#39;
      who aren&#39;t called to a vocation, but rather schlepping through a job.

  html: I am optimist in this matter. Not sure if we have single expert in every area
    of networking. Probably we have many. <br /><br />Some fundamental ideas are the
    same in many areas of Computer Science (QoS vs job handling batch processing during
    the mainframe days - just to cite Comer&#39;s podcast).<br />I believe in smart
    people - every time I have difficult problem to solve, I simply approach very
    smart guy and ask for help. Many times the guy does not know the particular area
    I am working on. And it works - he/she can help just thinking differently (sees
    bits instead of adresses - citing the Comer again).<br /><br />Some people are
    simply bright. Some know a lot (also know history) and have some advantage over
    other. Not always they are the same people. We need both. <br />You can learn
    the history (but the industry does not care if the previous attempt of using the
    idea was a failure) but it&#39;s difficult to fight brain limits. <br />

  html: While I am a bit of a history buff myself, I would say that it is more useful
    to learn fundamental principles/algorithms of which the technology (networking
    in this case) is based upon on.  So a solid foundation of computer science would
    help a lot.<br /><br />The tradeoffs are that it raises the learning complexity
    so it increases effort and time (more compute) :)

  html: 29 years in the telecom world here ... sadly enough :)<br /><br />I come from
    the world of x21, x25, PDH, SDH and WDM,- I kind of like this very rigid world
    of rules,- even after many years of Ip and routers.<br />In old days we tested
    a STM-16 (eq 2.5G) system fully cascade wired for 2-3 week, kicking it, slamming
    the doors, jerking fibers/cables, connectors etc. Not a single bit error was accepted.<br
    />Now we send 10 pings ... only 2 dropped? Perfect job!!<br /><br />What will
    the international network world look like in 20-30 years? I believe somehow in
    the upcoming SDN philosophy. Centralized control and configuration with end-to-end
    perspective. <br />No need for each L3 device making it&#39;s own decisions. <br
    /><br />Could we imagine Tier1 providers having &quot;major&quot; SDN policies,-
    instructing tier2 SDN controllers ... to tier3 SDN controllers ... etc?<br /><br
    />Just thinking .... good old hierarchical and efficient thinking applied to ip
    traffic?

    hype.<br />If you believe that new is always better ( bad marketing hype ) than
    why bother remembering the past ? It&#39;s not only in protocols btw. In some
    firms it&#39;s also how they manage information about N-1 and N-2 products.
