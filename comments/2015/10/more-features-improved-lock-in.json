      "html": "Perhaps by studying the history of server operating systems over the last 30 years, and the transition from vertically integrated servers first with proprietary operating systems (IBM mainframes, VMS, etc), then with proprietary integrations of open source (Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, etc), and in the end to disaggregated software (Linux, Windows Server) we can see that it is far cheaper per-unit to do the software once than it is to replicate hundreds of millions of dollars per year of R&amp;D at every hardware vendor... <br /><br />Will leave it as an exercise for the reader to think through the industry structure under which the customers benefit from the industry only doing the software once.  Hint: a single vendor who maximizes marginal revenue (that&#39;s a college level economics textbook phrase) is not that structure.",

If you spend a 6 figure sum of money to deploy openstack and use it organization wide, you are effectively locked into it indeed, because switching to something else, would mean another huge expense. There is, however, no lock-in in terms of integrations, whom you choose to get support from etc. Compare that to Oracle for example, who try real hard to lock you into their own OS, hardware and application stack, by declining support for anything else and you&#39;ll see the difference between vendor lock-in and what I would call tech-oriented self lock-in.",
