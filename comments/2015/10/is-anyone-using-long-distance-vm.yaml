  html: Similar to what you already commented, the only case I have seen this working
    is in a Tier-4 &quot;twin datacenter&quot;, two buildings together connected using
    many layer-2 links. In fact, in such design hosts from the same pod were distributed
    between both buildings, and the two uplinks from each server connected to access
    switches in both buildings. In any case, I believe such design does not account
    as two independent DC&#39;s.

  html: My first question about LISP is always &quot;who&#39;s going to operate it
    and how much will they cost?&quot;. Does someone really want their highly experienced
    (i.e. costly) staff get involved in daily operations because the L1/L2 support
    can&#39;t even understand the technology?

  html: working in public sector, I always thought the DCs I manage are &#39;behind
    the times&#39; because we don&#39;t have any L2 DCI.  The truth however is that
    there has NEVER been a compelling use case - and it has NEVER been requested.  I
    am glad we never went down that rabbit hole.  It&#39;s also encouraging to see
    that our lack of interest in L2 DCI didn&#39;t result in us being left out in
    any way.

  html: Another from the public sector. I&#39;ve been running OTV (without LISP) since
    late 2011, for a small set of data-center vlans. The initial driver was migration
    from an old data-center, for which OTV worked very well. What remains are 2 data-centers,
    about 30 miles apart, still linked (standard L3, and OTV).<br /><br />Amazingly,
    I was able to hold the server team to no L2 on storage or vmotion (so moves are
    SRM or Hyper-V replication). Further, because I&#39;m not using LISP to steer
    host traffic, the OTV extension is only for &quot;DR lite&quot;.<br /><br />So,
    another datapoint for not using long distance VM mobility. I continue to push
    towards applications that don&#39;t depend on L2 or static IPs.

  html: Tried VMWare&#39;s SRM, along with storage replication and DHCP for the VMs.
    Isn&#39;t perfect, but it works well enough to call it a cold BC/DR strategy.
    More importantly, it worked well enough to obviate the need for long-distance
    DCI, which leadership was pushing for.

  html: A Gold/premium partner of HP/EMC/...  told us to lease fibers between 2 datacenters
    for running fibre channel for synchronizing two 3Par SANs some months ago...<br
    />I think he has never heard anything about DCI at all

  html: '8 years ago we demonstrated the feasibility of DR using live migration for
    enterprise workload (paper : http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1555346 ) . However
    the actual practicality and requirement for the setup to work was such that it
    was highly risky to run. You added so many new points of failure along the path
    that hardening the whole system was an order of magnitude more expensive than
    other more sensible solutions.'
