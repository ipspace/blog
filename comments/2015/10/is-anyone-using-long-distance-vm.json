      "html": "Similar to what you already commented, the only case I have seen this working is in a Tier-4 &quot;twin datacenter&quot;, two buildings together connected using many layer-2 links. In fact, in such design hosts from the same pod were distributed between both buildings, and the two uplinks from each server connected to access switches in both buildings. In any case, I believe such design does not account as two independent DC&#39;s.",

      "html": "working in public sector, I always thought the DCs I manage are &#39;behind the times&#39; because we don&#39;t have any L2 DCI.  The truth however is that there has NEVER been a compelling use case - and it has NEVER been requested.  I am glad we never went down that rabbit hole.  It&#39;s also encouraging to see that our lack of interest in L2 DCI didn&#39;t result in us being left out in any way.",

      "html": "Another from the public sector. I&#39;ve been running OTV (without LISP) since late 2011, for a small set of data-center vlans. The initial driver was migration from an old data-center, for which OTV worked very well. What remains are 2 data-centers, about 30 miles apart, still linked (standard L3, and OTV).<br /><br />Amazingly, I was able to hold the server team to no L2 on storage or vmotion (so moves are SRM or Hyper-V replication). Further, because I&#39;m not using LISP to steer host traffic, the OTV extension is only for &quot;DR lite&quot;.<br /><br />So, another datapoint for not using long distance VM mobility. I continue to push towards applications that don&#39;t depend on L2 or static IPs.",

However the actual practicality and requirement for the setup to work was such that it was highly risky to run. You added so many new points of failure along the path that hardening the whole system was an order of magnitude more expensive than other more sensible solutions.",
