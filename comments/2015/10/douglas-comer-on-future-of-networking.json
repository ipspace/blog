We should be pursuing both.  Throw as much bandwidth in to your network as you can, then call me.  I&#39;ll bring some colleagues and we will saturate your network; and when we do you&#39;ll wish you had some policies in place to drop our traffic and preserve other traffic; especially if you&#39;re transporting data related to maintaining human life.  Mr. Ferro seems to argue that because we can download Netflix movies without issue, we can abandon technologies like QoS and multicast.  There&#39;s a lot at stake running on top of IP today; like it or not.  With all due respect, I think some from the founding generation of the Internet overlook this because they remember when packet based comms was just a cool thing to have; like a radio in 1950...well today radio frequencies are used for life-critical systems and jamming is illegal.<br />",

Even RIP (seems to be less complex stuff) lacked of split-horizon at first and needed this hack later - so in this case researchers failed. Maybe is a good idea to release &#39;SDN&#39; later to test it in real life environments",
