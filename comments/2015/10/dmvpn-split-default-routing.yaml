  html: Whats the advantage of putting IPSec in the VRF and the users in the global
    table versus the other way around? (I know little about DMVPN, so might be missing
    something obvious).

  html: 'also, one of the benefits is, using VRF aware IPsec, the only way to get
    between VRF&#39;s is via the Tunnel interface, which occurs on the creation of
    a successful IKE session. '

    html: You also can use PBR to solve this issue.<br />Create a route-map matching
      only non-private IPs an route them through the VPN.<br /><br />So you still
      have the possibility to route some stuff directly to the internet.
