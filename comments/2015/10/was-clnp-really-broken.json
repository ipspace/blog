      "html": "A while ago, I was going through a summary of a talk by another networking legend - Dr. Radia Perlman. She seems to suggest that we would not be in this IPv4 address shortage mess that we are in today had IETF accepted a proposal to use CLNP addressing for TCP/IP way back in 1993 when the size of the Internet was quite small and manageable. I went digging and found an RFC to support her statement as well - RFC 1561: Use of ISO CLNP in TUBA Environments.<br /><br />The egos and politics in IETF probably got in the way and here we are 22 years later struggling to &#39;transition&#39; from 32 bits to 128 bits. I believe CLNP offers variable length addressing up to 20 octets - much larger than the IPv6 address space. <br /><br />Better products or standards don&#39;t always win, there&#39;s market timing, money power, politics and egos of standards bodies etc. always come in the way.",
