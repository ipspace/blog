            <div class="comment-content">I can see the desire to own the network piece of ESX if you are the network admin. At the same time the coordination of 1000v upgrades/maintenance vs hypervisor upgrade ( an throw in a hypervisor firewall by a third party vendor in that stack) can be a nightmare. On the other hand, where I work we are not allowed to connect to the ESX console of network owned virtual appliances (like F5 virtual LTM) as we don&#39;t believe in RBAC :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">We know of an early vBlock adopter who selected the 1000v for exactly this reason. I believe the intent was for the network team to be able to manage the virtual switching (move/add/change and break/fix) in a more familiar manner. It turns out that having 1000v severely restricted the port groups that can be configured. The server team decided to remove it and the network team simply collaborates with them now. Network and Security work to develop the architecture and policies, but don&#39;t get involved in much day-to-day work within the platform. Not smooth as silk, but it more or less works.</div>
