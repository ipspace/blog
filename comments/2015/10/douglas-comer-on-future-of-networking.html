            <div class="comment-content">Really good podcast, but it got me worked up a bit.<br /><br />-Adding bandwidth<br />-Effective QoS mechanisms<br /><br />These two things are not mutually exclusive.  We should be pursuing both.  Throw as much bandwidth in to your network as you can, then call me.  I&#39;ll bring some colleagues and we will saturate your network; and when we do you&#39;ll wish you had some policies in place to drop our traffic and preserve other traffic; especially if you&#39;re transporting data related to maintaining human life.  Mr. Ferro seems to argue that because we can download Netflix movies without issue, we can abandon technologies like QoS and multicast.  There&#39;s a lot at stake running on top of IP today; like it or not.  With all due respect, I think some from the founding generation of the Internet overlook this because they remember when packet based comms was just a cool thing to have; like a radio in 1950...well today radio frequencies are used for life-critical systems and jamming is illegal.<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">What is interesting: I just looked into latest Comer books and have NOTfound any of those insights Mr Comer has shared with us.<br />For example the latest &quot;TCP/IP&quot; books contains pure information without interesting comments on QoS (not solvable w/o having really enough bandwidth), SDN(good for researchers at this stage of development), LISP (who wants to have access to a device when the cloud is a &quot;rendezvous point&quot;, Role of aggregation when it comes to Internet of Things, etc.<br /><br />I think we needs those insights because we, Comer books readers, believe that all presented technologies in the books are equally good;) At least when starting the career...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Well, I&#39;m not someone who could comment on this (and I haven&#39;t read his latest books), but many technical book authors prefer to stick to facts and not express opinions, regardless of how valid they might be.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">That&#39;s why I appreciate your blog to learn about real experience with the technology, not only pure &#39;facts&#39; (that actually might not be good solutions in real life). If the book is only pure technology description it promotes any technology  - we do not know if the technology scales well for example without trying it ourselves or read other blogs/comments.<br /><br />In my opinion the book should contain insights, especially if the author is famous thinker to influence what we are designing / buying. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">Another comment:<br />Not sure if always researchers should look into the technology so deeply as Mr Comer says when he talked about SDN. Even RIP (seems to be less complex stuff) lacked of split-horizon at first and needed this hack later - so in this case researchers failed. Maybe is a good idea to release &#39;SDN&#39; later to test it in real life environments</div>

            <div class="comment-content">After re-listening htis podcast for a few times I can&#39;t emphasize enough how the views explained by Douglas have a profound impact on how I view SDN at this time. Not to discredit Mr. Ferro, but I think a similar conversation with Ivan and Douglas would offer even more insight. ;-)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I think that Greg style (I would say a little bit provoking) made the discussion more interesting, or in other words, less serious.  <br />I appreciate his effort to make this podcast happen. So he deserves the right to lead the discussion his way. I would love to hear another famous thinker!<br /></div>
