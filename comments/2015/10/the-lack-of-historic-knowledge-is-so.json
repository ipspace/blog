While not used any longer in most parts of the world, it did teach the concepts of NBMA. Something that is critical when working with DMVPN. Also, FR has some similar concepts to MPLS, making the gap to learn MPLS a bit lower.<br /><br />While I&#39;ve never touched Decnet, Appletalk or IPX (except on home PC) I try to keep aware of what existed in the past.

          "html": "Agreed.  More of a blanket statement than any pointed issue with your list of failures.<br /><br />Lessons learned...  I think that #1 and #3 would be essentially semantic arguments and, while they might make for a wonderful conversation at the bar, are not terribly interesting on the Internet ( define &quot;scale&quot; in flow-based systems, for example ).  So let&#39;s talk about #2.<br /><br />There are semantics in play here as well, but I submit that the most evident reason hop-by-hop fails that I have encountered is the complexities involved in device administration rather and information security than in any inherent technical shortcoming in the _idea_ that all the information needed for forwarding is carried within the packet.  Following instructions in a label or header is simple, making sure that the rules about what that label or header _mean_ to the follower are consistent and trustworthy is hard.<br /><br />So, while there is a long and not particularly distinguished list of failed attempts to do this, the ones that I can think of failed because we weren&#39;t ready with the security and administration apparatus, not because they didn&#39;t actually work well or scale well.<br /><br />And, on the flip side, by using path based forwarding to defer dealing with those security and administration shortfalls we just kicked the can down the road for a generation.  <br /><br />Now we have examples of how to do ad-hoc tamper prevention and hyper-scale distributed node administration in real world situations, so it is perhaps reasonable that you could, for example, actually use IPv6+AH+hop-by-hop options and expect it would work. That is something of an ideal world argument, because it wouldn&#39;t work at all because we&#39;ve all set our devices to ignore options because we can barely agree on how to propagate routes in a trustworthy and non-destructive manner, much less how to trust the rich end of the IP header.  <br /><br />My point is that calling one better than the other is subjective when the &quot;better&quot; created a culture that is so afraid of a problem that they reject the solution.

And that what &quot;won&quot; many times did because it was good enough not because it was better than it&#39;s competition but because of externalities like price or access to code or presence/absence of proprietary ecosystem.  Things that certainly matter but don&#39;t really inform us about how to make good architectural decisions.<br /><br />Just because something failed commercially doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that what we should learn from that failure is that the technique itself was flawed.

Probably we have many. <br /><br />Some fundamental ideas are the same in many areas of Computer Science (QoS vs job handling batch processing during the mainframe days - just to cite Comer&#39;s podcast).<br />I believe in smart people - every time I have difficult problem to solve, I simply approach very smart guy and ask for help. Many times the guy does not know the particular area I am working on. And it works - he/she can help just thinking differently (sees bits instead of adresses - citing the Comer again).<br /><br />Some people are simply bright. Some know a lot (also know history) and have some advantage over other. Not always they are the same people. We need both. <br />You can learn the history (but the industry does not care if the previous attempt of using the idea was a failure) but it&#39;s difficult to fight brain limits. <br />",

Perfect job!!<br /><br />What will the international network world look like in 20-30 years? I believe somehow in the upcoming SDN philosophy. Centralized control and configuration with end-to-end perspective. <br />No need for each L3 device making it&#39;s own decisions. <br /><br />Could we imagine Tier1 providers having &quot;major&quot; SDN policies,- instructing tier2 SDN controllers ... to tier3 SDN controllers ... etc?<br /><br />Just thinking .... good old hierarchical and efficient thinking applied to ip traffic?",
