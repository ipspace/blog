            <div class="comment-content">I use the following principle when going to take part in a training: find the best trainer and get prepared.<br /><br />I always study the topic BEFORE taking part in  any kind of classes just to get most out of a training. If you are not prepared you spend time on basic stuff and you do not have time to think it over and learn as much as possible from a trainer (assumed that that the trainer is really good at the subject).</div>
