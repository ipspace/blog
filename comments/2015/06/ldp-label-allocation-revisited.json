LDP is relying on the underlying IGP. <br /><br />So at the end this label would be ignored on R1 as the path-calculation of the IGP will not use R2 as next-hop for 1.1.1.1/32 as it is directly connected.",

      "html": "I suppose another historic reason is Independent Label Distribution Mode used by Cisco. I dont see why would it be nowadays profitable to have label allocatel right away and not to wait till the whole path would have labels allocated.<br /><br />As for Alcatel-Lucent routers they also bind labels for &quot;system&quot; ip address and for prefixes with allocated labels from a downstream router http://noshut.ru/2015/06/ldp-ordered-label-distribution-control-explained/<br /><br />One interesting question I faced when learning LDP is how do routers perform split-horizon? If we have three routers in line (R1-R2-R3) and R1 starts tp propagate label for its lo1=1.1.1.1/32, how would R2 determine not to send it back to R1? ",

I&#39;ve heard faster convergence before since the whole network doesn&#39;t have to be &quot;up&quot; speaking MPLS before MPLS could be switched.   ",

      "html": "Q: Does allocating a label per prefix have some advantages I\u2019m not seeing? <br />Sure it does, just look for the &quot;mpls label mode all-vrfs protocol bgp-vpnv4 per-?<br />per-prefix  per-vrf&quot; command and its limitations for different platforms. On MPLS PE routers VRFs there are several limitations once you decide to allocate per vrf or per CE label, you cannot use (e|i)BGP multipath, EIGRP multipath, BGP PIC,CSC scenarios...<br /><br />This means that the per prefix allocation on Cisco makes use of mpls label switching at the edge, so once you use 1 label to represent more prefixes you need additional lookup at the edge to forward the packet to the correct next hop.
