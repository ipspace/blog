          "html": "Not necessarily. There is a standardized control-forwarding plane protocol for this, ForCES. It&#39;s an IETF standardized protocol although currently not widely adopted. We have done a very limited implementation of subscribing to events and receiving only what is relevant to the &quot;centralized control plane&quot; and we have achieved very good results.

      "html": "Great write up. Absolute centralised control-plane is difficult and does just not scale. Have you tried building an OpenFlow network and actually building out a management network in a constrained environment so that the nodes can talk to the controller? Have you tried running that network with meaningful information without chopping off the branch you&#39;re sitting on? Hah. Good luck. Not fun. My own views on this are &#39;make things easy&#39;. So many answers aren&#39;t there for architecture on a distributed nature. We have *some* of the required tools.<br /><br />I do happen to think that edge nodes will go more down the pub/sub route for sharing information with points of awareness scattered through an environment. Information en-masse is only relevant as per your requirement. In which case you can stream the information that is relevant to your scenario. It&#39;s no secret that some major products use pub/sub systems for telemetry and awareness of information. A centralised decision engine could subscribe to a set of events or streams and then push desired outcomes or decisions back in to the data bus instead of programming each node independently from a centralised control-plane controller and forwarding path management in the form of a centralised controller.<br /><br />This of course all points to proprietary mechanisms and I don&#39;t see any path for standardised control-plane architectures for fabrics or software networking yet. If there is work taking place in this field I would be keen to see it.<br /><br />Gah - spit balling here, but posts like this stir the mind!",

      "html": "Again, great article and follow up from your previous post.   The OpenFlow camp took the notion of centralize control plane to literally and like lemmings followed blindly down that path.   There is great value in centralized computation and service orchestration, but the notion that clearly locatizable functions like local state also be centralized is nonsensical and wont scale; we learn that in distributed computing class 101.  <br />What you really want is central computation and the knowledge of the controller to be able to give each device type enough information that it needs to act semi-autonomously for those localized functions, but ensure that changes to topology and service or events that effect these are integrated back into the central computational controller.   This is what we&#39;ve done in the CPLANE NETWORKS Controller.  ",
