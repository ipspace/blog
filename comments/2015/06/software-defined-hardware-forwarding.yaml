    html: Did you read the &quot;Note&quot; in the blog post (above)? Writing the
      table forwarding structure is perfectly legal in OpenFlow 1.3.

    html: Orr, we&#39;re perfectly in sync, and I was as surprised as you are when
      HP claimed they can not only reprogram the forwarding path, but also do that
      through WRITE OpenFlow messages. Maybe it&#39;s time to get hands on one of
      those switches and verify the claims? ;)

  html: 'Ivan -<br />While it&#39;s true that O/F allows the controller to &quot;write&quot;
    to the switch the table-Features, I know of no HW switch that supports it, and
    have not heard of a single case where  this was successfully used. It may exist
    - but may be under NDA. I regularly attend ONF meetings where this would have
    been big news. <br />(Even with SW switches,  or NPU-based switches, Where this
    could be supported, assuming some way to handle resource allocation for each asked-for
    data-plane configuration - if this exists, it is not widely publicized) <br /><br
    /><br />Even the READ part  of this is hard with ASIC-based switches. OpenFlow
    allows them to implement a different subset of features in each table, and to
    select which function will be done in which table. Different vendors. or even
    different switch models of the same vendor, even if they all use the same ASIC
    or ASIC family, may (usually are) different in details. <br />On the other hand,
    the controller must know EXACTLY which table does what. if you write an application,
    you must find a way to map your requirements on the exact  combination of which
    table does what in which switch model - this can quickly get to an astronomical
    # of possible permutations, so you tend to use the minimum denominator, or go
    single-vendor, or both. <br />No full solution (that I know of) exists for this,
    but some mitigations are TTP&#39;s and Switch-profiles, and PO4 used to promise
    to bypass this by having a paradigm of controller DEFINES the data-plane, switch
    implements it, then controller can use what it has just defined. how this will
    work in practice - We&#39;ll see. '
