    html: They definitely invested an enormous amount of time and energy into it.
      Too bad it focuses on what they call &quot;canonical SDN&quot;, which I still
      claim is not exactly relevant (which they somewhat admit at one point, and then
      carry on).

    html: Yes, huge effort. And huge document to read at once;) They also admit the
      existence and rationale of hybrid approach where the existing distributed control
      plane is enhanced by &#39;centralized controller&#39; (following your vocabulary).
      They also mentioned classical approach shortcomings (scalability &amp; resilience
      issues). Seems to be very close to your opinions about the SDN.

  html: I agree, and I disagree... Centralized calculation of reachability and topology
    is what most people think of when they think &quot;SDNs.&quot; I&#39;ve started
    using the term &quot;programmable network,&quot; as a stand in for solutions that
    centralize policy while distributing reachability calculation, and the like. We
    definitely need a divide that will make this stuff scalable, but we&#39;re not
    really _thinking_ about what that divide should look like.<br /><br />We&#39;re
    just running around centralizing willy nilly. We need to sit for a spell and think
    about what it is we&#39;re trying to do, and why.

    html: I don&#39;t think I wrote a blog post on this specific one. Time to fix
      that ;)<br /><br />As for &quot;do we have a single gigantic policy which gets
      pushed down&quot; - smart implementations don&#39;t do that, but figure out
      what needs to be pushed down into each element, and only push down the absolute
      minimum of rules.

  html: Centralized management has of course existed since the dawn of time.  I remain
    confused regarding centralizing &quot;policy&quot; or control-plane functions;
    specifically what happens when a network node receives an incoming data packet
    or frame.  Does the node have to hold the packet, communicate with the SDN controller
    via OpenFlow, wait for a pass / fail message (a la RADIUS), then forward the actual
    packet(s)?  Or, is the concept to have a single gigantic &quot;policy&quot; /
    ACL for the entire network which gets pushed down to every poor little network
    element?  I feel like I&#39;m missing some key concepts driving the SDN bandwagon.

  html: 'Great Post.  We at CPLANE NETWORKS have been touting the benefits of multi-protocol
    centralized service orchestration for a long time.   Whether it&#39;s bandwidth
    management, path computation or &quot;service stitching&quot; for example, provisioning
    vxlan overlays and mpls vpn with path/quality control together to provide a higher
    service offering, the need is to understand each device and it&#39;s capabilities
    in an overall system.   For a long time OpenFlow and control plane have taken
    most of the oxygen out of the room. As focus shifts from the limitations of OpenFlow/control
    plane the focus is going to centralized service orchestration.    The key of successful
    orchestration is being able to straddle newer and older technologies.   Service
    Orchestration by nature is never green field.   '

  html: 'Great post (again) Ivan. This knowledge helps to bridge the gap between what
    management thinks SDN is (read: what vendors tell them) and what it really means
    when using it in production. Of which I only see demo/lab implementations. Vendors
    will equate lab/demo with production so it looks good in marketing sheets.'
