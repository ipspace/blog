While it&#39;s theoretically possible to implement whatever information distribution mechanism with SNMP, doing so is exceedingly hard when compared to something like REST API with JSON-formatted data. <br /><br />It&#39;s almost like asking &quot;what&#39;s the benefit of this new SSD thing over the tapes we&#39;ve been using for the last 50 years&quot;... after all, they all get the job done ;)",
