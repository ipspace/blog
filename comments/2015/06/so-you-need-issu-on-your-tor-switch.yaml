    html: You can do a software update without an approved change if you have ISSU?

  html: Change management processes/rules are the biggest drivers for having ISSU
    implemented. :)

  html: If it&#39;s hitless than the SLAs typically allow you to schedule them more
    quickly.  One of those, &quot;if it fails, you can ask forgiveness,&quot; but
    if you know for sure it will fail, then you need all those lead times.

  html: Imagine just how simple the network could be if we just didn&#39;t care so
    much about layer 2 all over the place and other weird solutions, and went straight
    to a routed IPv6 network without looking back. No NAT either, just simple robust
    easy to understand routing without any special hacks or protocols.   <br /><br
    />Maybe the big public cloud providers can finally &quot;save us&quot;. They don&#39;t
    seem too interested in implementing all crazy shit (that doesn&#39;t scale) :)  <br
    /><br />But then again, why dream. Let&#39;s add complexity because it&#39;s more
    fun this way (it creates bureaucracy and network engineers jobs)...

    html: Agreed. In a perfect world you won&#39;t need ISSU on ToR switches. But
      when you have single-NIC servers and thousands of ToR switches, coordinating
      maintenance windows for software upgrades becomes a nightmare especially when
      the applications were not designed to fail. ISSU in this case makes your life
      easier. Several vendors today support ISSU in their ToRs.

  html: Unfortunately, often things are as black and white in real life.... Yes, it
    seems like that ideally ISSU won&#39;t be logically needed on a top of rack switch.
    In practice, there are always complications and corner cases when you would rather
    have it (or, possibly, a &quot;fast reboot&quot; where it fits as an alternative).
    <br /><br />And last, but not least, things get much more involved when you build
    your own SW and roll the updates continuously to the fleet :)

  html: 'The TOR is no longer an &quot;access&quot; switch. Today&#39;s high-density,
    high-speed pizza-box/non-modular switches deployed at the TOR serve as aggregation
    switches (with access relegated to the soft-switch inside the virtualized server).
    If you think HA is critical in the legacy aggregation/core switch, then this new
    class of aggregation points in the current data-centers will need them in the
    enterprise still running legacy apps (now virtualized, of course). Juniper, Cisco
    and Brocade all support this on their high-density fixed-form factor TOR switches
    they target for enterprise DCs.  '

  html: Just to add to my previous comment. Imaged the servers being bladed servers,
    then you will see the importance and the critical new role the current TORs play
    as aggregation points (think N5K aggregating some 4K VMs, you want to add some
    resiliency - yes, traditional thinking but that&#39;s the way customers have been
    programmed to think - good or bad).
