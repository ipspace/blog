      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />At Midokura we take advantage of the fact that we can precisely determine the ingress and egress hosts of a flow. These hosts are bound to a manageable number, so we can efficiently replicate state across them. At really large scale we turn to partitioning: an arbitrary packet can ingress at N hosts, but packets of a particular flow are pinned to a partition of N. Some of the details are explained here: http://blog.midonet.org/introduction-to-mn-part-5-flow-state/",
