      "html": "I looked at Calico from an enterprise perspective i.e. no multi-tenancy. What I liked was turning the hypervisor into a router and exchanging host routes with the ToR. I also liked the direct connectivity between virtual machines and physical servers whether they are databases, or backup systems, etc. without a need for an overlay connecting to a gateway of some sort. <br /><br />I do think scalability could be limited with all the host routes being advertised into the core switching environment. As you stated, summarization at the ToR, could be an answer. <br /><br />You note that you have a concern with IP forwarding in Linux. Would this be similar to the performance of a vxlan gateway in kernel in a hypervisor such as ESX? <br /><br />All in all, I thought it was a clever solution to avoid an overlay network deployment. For my enterprise though, it is not going to work in the near future since we have standardized on VMware.",

I haven&#39;t kept up but 6WIND was going to contribute changes to Quagga to support VRFs through Linux network namespaces.  On the Quagga side it could be represented by a different physical interface or VLAN or whatever.  ",

Would be great if a network picture could be added to this article to make it clearer.<br /><br />Does Amazon VPC do the same thing alongwith some type of MPLS VPN/ EVPN ?<br /><br />",

      "html": "Very interesting read.  We are actually using Calico at our Bare Metal servers for our front-ended Elastic Cloud Routers we deploy.  We are a pure L3 design where we do eBGP from the Calico/BIRD container on the BMS up to the LEAF, and then iBGP up to the SPINE.  Route-Reflection and all the like is in place, so scalability is there.  Our workloads are able to spin up fine etc..  The key for us though, is we aren&#39;t a multi-tenant environment for the edge use case.  It&#39;s purely for ingest.  I&#39;m really looking forward to seeing where they take Calico over the years, and also if they focus solely on the container world, or lean more towards OpenStack integration and beef up their Neutron integrations.
