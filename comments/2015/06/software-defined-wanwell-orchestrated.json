There are protocols that have 20-30 years of exposure to the real world (BGP) so to say that you can design something better than that, takes a pretty big ego.<br /><br />I&#39;m not saying there isn&#39;t room for innovation but there is no gain in inventing something new if there is already a suitable tool out there.<br /><br />What&#39;s funny is that people are even repeating the same mistakes of the past. I&#39;m actually writing an article on the subject. I think you may find it interesting.",

      "html": "Reading this I was wondering if you were aware of Internet2&#39;s AL2S service (http://www.internet2.edu/products-services/advanced-networking/layer-2-services/#service-features). It essentially offers a GUI portal as well as API/OpenFlow programmability for extending arbitrary VLANs between participating member sites using the Internet2 backbone. In this sense it&#39;s a full SDN platform you can use for programming WAN connectivity. This includes being able to program the path between I2 backbone nodes that the VLAN will take, as well as a backup path to swing to should a primary path segment fail. Interestingly this isn&#39;t just used by members for various research and education purposes, but is in fact used by I2 itself. I2 is its own customer with this product, and the routed I2 backbone - the IP services most people associate with I2 - runs on top of AL2S itself.<br /><br />It&#39;s an interesting example of SDN being used for WAN provisioning used in full production for a rather large amount of traffic and with quite a few customers, albeit in a manner put together by I2 and its NOC and software developers themselves rather than buying a product from a vendor.",

I think you might be over-optimistic in regard to the whole &quot;controller-based&quot; hype. <br /><br />As Gryz pointed out, there&#39;s absolutely no reason you couldn&#39;t have done the same thing with existing devices (we just didn&#39;t for zillions of reasons). Also, most of the SD-WAN solutions use exactly the same mechanisms as existing hybrid WAN solutions, you just don&#39;t see the complexity.<br /><br />Finally, speaking of complexity, you wrote &quot;SD-WAN makes the complex easy, which has been one of the promises of SDN from the beginning&quot;. I sincerely hope you don&#39;t believe that. Do a deep dive into any SDN technology or product, and you&#39;ll find plenty of untested complexity with as-of-yet-unknown side effects. What many SDx solutions give you is the _appearance_ of being easy, and I have hoped we&#39;ve learned how reliable those appearances are based on our experience with single-pane-of-whatever systems.",

We don&#39;t at all disagree on the fact that they should be using established/standardized tech where possible but I do believe they are working to deliver on a valuable concept if done correctly.

      "html": "Ivan,<br /><br />Generally, I agree that the SD-WAN vendors are simply rehashing older technology in generally proprietary ways.  Where I begin to disagree is that the new model doesn&#39;t offer some advantages we don&#39;t currently have.  <br /><br />The primary differentiation for me is the concept of &quot;local perspective&quot; vs &quot;controller perspective&quot;.  As engineers we tend to shy away from protocols like PBR because of the local perspective problem.  As we implement fancy new ways to forward our traffic as determined by policy/logic (rather than destination IP) we are required to implement those changes across a myriad of devices to avoid issues like asynchronous forwarding.  Since every device makes the decisions locally, this policy tends to be unique per device and as such ends up being a pain to manage in the long run.  Additionally, changes to the policy usually require a reconfiguration of each device (and again, uniquely since they aren&#39;t all the same).  Moving to a centralized &quot;controller perspective&quot; version of configuration removes a lot of the hassle of implementing these technologies and by doing so is reducing cost and administrative complexity.  That is a good thing and opens up the use of these technologies to organizations who would benefit from them but may not have the advanced level of expertise on staff to manage them in their current state.<br /><br />Similarly, the &quot;localized perspective&quot; issue raises it&#39;s head again when we talk about state monitoring and correction.  You are correct that many engineers are not thrilled with the performance of previous generations of WAN optimization but they suffered from the same localized perspective issues.  Traffic quality was determined wholly by the receiving end of the link and because of that it was unreliable to depend on.  The &quot;controller perspective&quot; of these new SD-WAN options are able to make decisions with data from both the transmit and receive end of the link.  It&#39;s not a guarantee but it should dramatically improve detection of line degradation, and consequently which corrective measures to take to resolve them.<br /><br />My last point is this... I don&#39;t think SD-WAN is meant to appeal to high end engineers.  SD-WAN is going to be wildly successful because the people who will buy into the concept (and ultimately pay to have it installed) couldn&#39;t describe the features of any of the technology/acronyms you used in your post.  It makes the complex easy, which has been one of the promises of SDN from the beginning.  None of the tech is new, but it is becoming far more accessible because of this new way of implementing it.",

You have zero chance to do that with undocumented proprietary protocols.<br /><br />Do you agree?",

      "html": "Hey Ivan nice post as usual. You are the best. However ?I got this point <br /><br />&quot;The architecture of most SD-WAN products is thus much cleaner and easier to configure than traditional hybrid networks. However, do keep in mind that most of them use proprietary protocols, resulting in a perfect lock-in.&quot;<br /><br />In this case I should consider that today using tools like DMVPN I&#39;m not locked-in ? Just Curious It\u00b4s usual have interoperability in this type of network with multiple nodes in remote sites ? I mean to scale I have to use something like DMVPN for instance, So for me we already live in a lock-in world. Do you agree ?",
