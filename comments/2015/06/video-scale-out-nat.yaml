  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />How do hypervisors advertise Public floating IP addresses?
    Even in Openstack the floating IP address is added as secondary public IP address
    to the interface. Do the hypervisors run some routing protocol?<br /><br />Regards,<br
    />Amit.

  html: 'Hi Ivan,<br /><br />At Midokura we take advantage of the fact that we can
    precisely determine the ingress and egress hosts of a flow. These hosts are bound
    to a manageable number, so we can efficiently replicate state across them. At
    really large scale we turn to partitioning: an arbitrary packet can ingress at
    N hosts, but packets of a particular flow are pinned to a partition of N. Some
    of the details are explained here: http://blog.midonet.org/introduction-to-mn-part-5-flow-state/'
