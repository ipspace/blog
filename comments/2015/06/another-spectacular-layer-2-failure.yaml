    html: Yes, they do not use STP or any other L2 protocols. Instead, they use VPLS
      to create a L2 fabric. And yes they use photonic switch to provide redundancy
      on customer facing port on the VPLS PE router but that has nothing to do with
      L2 loop.

  html: I once read they even don&#39;t rely on L2 protocols like STP to provide redundancy
    (which maybe hit them in this case) but they do this on L1 with photonic switches
    (tiny mirrors redirect the fiber links)

  html: Anonymous simce I don&#39;t want to be pinpointed to my customer, but AMS-IX
    guys seems to be a little clumsy lately.<br />Multiple mistakes during upgrade,
    missing communication, loss of monitoring, lack of responsiveness during customer
    request/complaints.<br /><br />We have been reassured they are  handling these
    bad behavior, but we still have faults related to humans too often, the RIPE70
    case being the top of the iceberg.<br /><br />Other IX seems to handle things
    a little better, even if I have to admit their network being a lot simpler.. Nevertheless
    these fault are not related to net complexity, but rather to user actions.<br

  html: And this is the reason why I always tell people that when a port is unused
    you have to configure it as a L3 port (&quot;no switchport&quot; in Cisco/Arista
    terms) rather than have it shutdown...

  html: Well, operator error could cause collateral damage on any layer, not just
    L2.<br />See recent BGP leak from June 12-th, which caused serious problems for
    2 hours:<br /><br />www.bgpmon.net/massive-route-leak-cause-internet-slowdown/

    html: In theory, you could. In practice, high-speed reasonable-cost linecards
      don&#39;t always support tunneling in hardware... and you&#39;d end up with
      a total mess of tunnels (not to mention the MTU issues).<br /><br />There are
      probably other considerations that I&#39;m not aware of as well - in any case,
      all big IXPs use L2 approach (and some new ones use customer-L2-over-transport-IP
      for internal stability) - either they&#39;re all stupid, or we&#39;re missing
      something ;)

  html: "I have to address the assertion regardin IXP stuck to L2 (&quot;Internet\
    \ exchanges that don\u2019t want to dictate routing policies of their members\
    \ have to be layer-2 fabrics&quot;).<br /><br />On a L3 IXP, you&#39;d eventually\
    \ peer with the router&#39;s BGP instance, and add your netowrk&#39;s routes to\
    \ the IXP&#39;s routing tables.<br /><br />Now, you&#39;d want to establish a\
    \ direct session to another member to offer different routes and discard the common\
    \ routing information for your prefixes.<br /><br />Why couldn&#39;t you encapsulate\
    \ that with any protocol supported in hardware by your router (GRE, IPIP, L2TPv3\u2026\
    ) ? Of course it looks like a waste of ressources, but it would remove complexity\
    \ from the IXP itself, making it even more robust\u2026"
