  html: Great podcast I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />As additional information I
    am aware of 2 open sorurce IPAM projects:<br />phpIPAM and NIPAP. Both supports
    IPv6.<br /><br />For the SNMP tool / alerting category I can highly recommand
    OMD the open monitoring distribution project with the Check_MK web frontend. It
    basically combines the 2 category into one solution. You have about ~ 15 tools
    included in OMD wich all can be installed with one packet. That makes it really
    easy to start with OMD and Check_MK, I have manged to monitor a network with a
    few hundred notes with Check_mk in a few hours.<br />I added a quick link how
    to get started with OMD from my blog:<br />http://networkautobahn.com/2015/01/15/how-to-get-started-with-omd-and-check_mk/<br
    /><br />Cheers

  html: Nice one Ivan - opened my eyes to a whole world I was missing around graphite
    and inflowdb!<br />As for the IPAMs, like Dominik already suggested, try NIPAP
    and phpIPAM! I personally think NIPAP is for the bigger networks while phpIPAM
    is more suited for the smaller enterprise. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Marius

  html: I know the topic is open source network monitoring tools, but since a few
    commercial ones were mentioned in the podcast, I thought I would mention PRTG.<br
    />They offer the 100 sensor version for free, which makes it easy to get started
    and  I think would be enough monitoring points for most small businesses. It&#39;s
    very easy to install and get going. <br />Great podcast btw, I&#39;ve heard of
    some of the tools but not others, so now I have some new things to check out.<br
    /><br />Thanks.<br />rgt

  html: I know I&#39;m a bit late to the party here but thought that it would be worth
    mentioning Observium or LibreNMS for the graphing category.<br />Observium / LibreNMS
    are pretty quick to get going and easy to use for small businesses SNMP based
    graphing of all the things (including handy things like interface errors); the
    best thing for small teams is that it automatically discovers and graphs all interfaces
    and often CPU, Memory and Storage as well so adding new devices is very quick
    and easy. www.observium.org / www.librenms.org<br /><br />There is also some basic
    alerting functionality as well but you have to remember that it is based on the
    5 minute polling cycle data so it is not immediate.
