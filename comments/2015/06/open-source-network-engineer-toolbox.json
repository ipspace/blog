      "html": "Great podcast I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />As additional information I am aware of 2 open sorurce IPAM projects:<br />phpIPAM and NIPAP. Both supports IPv6.<br /><br />For the SNMP tool / alerting category I can highly recommand OMD the open monitoring distribution project with the Check_MK web frontend. It basically combines the 2 category into one solution. You have about ~ 15 tools included in OMD wich all can be installed with one packet. That makes it really easy to start with OMD and Check_MK, I have manged to monitor a network with a few hundred notes with Check_mk in a few hours.<br />I added a quick link how to get started with OMD from my blog:<br />http://networkautobahn.com/2015/01/15/how-to-get-started-with-omd-and-check_mk/<br /><br />Cheers",

      "html": "Nice one Ivan - opened my eyes to a whole world I was missing around graphite and inflowdb!<br />As for the IPAMs, like Dominik already suggested, try NIPAP and phpIPAM! I personally think NIPAP is for the bigger networks while phpIPAM is more suited for the smaller enterprise. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Marius",

      "html": "I know the topic is open source network monitoring tools, but since a few commercial ones were mentioned in the podcast, I thought I would mention PRTG.<br />They offer the 100 sensor version for free, which makes it easy to get started and  I think would be enough monitoring points for most small businesses. It&#39;s very easy to install and get going. <br />Great podcast btw, I&#39;ve heard of some of the tools but not others, so now I have some new things to check out.<br /><br />Thanks.<br />rgt",
