    html: It&#39;s mostly ease-of-use. While it&#39;s theoretically possible to implement
      whatever information distribution mechanism with SNMP, doing so is exceedingly
      hard when compared to something like REST API with JSON-formatted data. <br
      /><br />It&#39;s almost like asking &quot;what&#39;s the benefit of this new
      SSD thing over the tapes we&#39;ve been using for the last 50 years&quot;...
      after all, they all get the job done ;)

    html: Thanks for clarification!<br /><br />P.S. I am working with such  solution
      - ZTE NMS U31, which is SNMP based with some improvements. It rather new product,
      so it was not obvious for me (at least i had such hope) that SNMP is like a
      &quot;tape&quot; of configuration world =)

  html: Hello Ivan!<br /><br />I am wondering what benefits new policy distribution
    protocols has over of uploading and aplying commands via SNMP ( method used for
    e.g. with NAC infrastructure)?<br />
