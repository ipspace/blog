      "html": "Ivan -<br />While it&#39;s true that O/F allows the controller to &quot;write&quot; to the switch the table-Features, I know of no HW switch that supports it, and have not heard of a single case where  this was successfully used. It may exist - but may be under NDA. I regularly attend ONF meetings where this would have been big news. <br />(Even with SW switches,  or NPU-based switches, Where this could be supported, assuming some way to handle resource allocation for each asked-for data-plane configuration - if this exists, it is not widely publicized) <br /><br /><br />Even the READ part  of this is hard with ASIC-based switches. OpenFlow allows them to implement a different subset of features in each table, and to select which function will be done in which table. Different vendors. or even different switch models of the same vendor, even if they all use the same ASIC or ASIC family, may (usually are) different in details. <br />On the other hand, the controller must know EXACTLY which table does what. if you write an application, you must find a way to map your requirements on the exact  combination of which table does what in which switch model - this can quickly get to an astronomical # of possible permutations, so you tend to use the minimum denominator, or go single-vendor, or both. <br />No full solution (that I know of) exists for this, but some mitigations are TTP&#39;s and Switch-profiles, and PO4 used to promise to bypass this by having a paradigm of controller DEFINES the data-plane, switch implements it, then controller can use what it has just defined. how this will work in practice - We&#39;ll see.
