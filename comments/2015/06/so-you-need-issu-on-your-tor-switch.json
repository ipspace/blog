No NAT either, just simple robust easy to understand routing without any special hacks or protocols.   <br /><br />Maybe the big public cloud providers can finally &quot;save us&quot;. They don&#39;t seem too interested in implementing all crazy shit (that doesn&#39;t scale) :)  <br /><br />But then again, why dream. Let&#39;s add complexity because it&#39;s more fun this way (it creates bureaucracy and network engineers jobs)...",

But when you have single-NIC servers and thousands of ToR switches, coordinating maintenance windows for software upgrades becomes a nightmare especially when the applications were not designed to fail. ISSU in this case makes your life easier. Several vendors today support ISSU in their ToRs.",

In practice, there are always complications and corner cases when you would rather have it (or, possibly, a &quot;fast reboot&quot; where it fits as an alternative). <br /><br />And last, but not least, things get much more involved when you build your own SW and roll the updates continuously to the fleet :)",

      "html": "The TOR is no longer an &quot;access&quot; switch. Today&#39;s high-density, high-speed pizza-box/non-modular switches deployed at the TOR serve as aggregation switches (with access relegated to the soft-switch inside the virtualized server). If you think HA is critical in the legacy aggregation/core switch, then this new class of aggregation points in the current data-centers will need them in the enterprise still running legacy apps (now virtualized, of course). Juniper, Cisco and Brocade all support this on their high-density fixed-form factor TOR switches they target for enterprise DCs.  ",

Imaged the servers being bladed servers, then you will see the importance and the critical new role the current TORs play as aggregation points (think N5K aggregating some 4K VMs, you want to add some resiliency - yes, traditional thinking but that&#39;s the way customers have been programmed to think - good or bad).",
