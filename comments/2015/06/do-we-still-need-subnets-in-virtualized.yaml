  html: Why not ? If your inserted vnic firewall could convert the ARP bcast into
    a tenant mcast, then it would work, same IP with different MAC addresses :) LOL

  html: the title is misleading vs what the post describes.<br /><br />Everything,
    and I mean everything, in the networking world has standardized on IP and Ethernet
    (or 802.2 framing).  Thus for better for worse, the notion of a subnet or a mean
    to organize the IP addressing space will always be required.<br /><br />What is
    happening with network virtualization, starting with MPLS actually, is dissociating
    things from IP that should have never been there in the first place...  but we
    did not have much choices at the time.  Things like proxying the identity of an
    individual, a group or  a function via a subnet (HR department = subnet A or VoIP
    = subnet B), geo-location (subnet X exists only in data center A or city XX),
    etc.<br /><br />IP is a forwarding mechanism, period.  It has its characteristics
    that need to be engineered to work well and as such things like NAT and subnets
    will be required.<br /><br />from a security perspective, relying on attributes
    that do not have any dependencies as to which address you have, network you came
    from or trying to reach (approach which is continuously failing us) is the right
    way to go.<br /><br />Yes unfortunately I have heard that a flat network was just
    fine in the virtual world but I have heard more similar &quot;truths&quot; from
    the traditional networking and security teams which are just taking shortcuts
    rather than trying to understand how technology features can be associated and
    leveraged to deliver elegant solutions.<br />

  html: Hi Ivan,<br />strangely enough what you described is exactly what we implemented
    2 years ago at one of my previous employers.<br />The decision was to use /16
    subnets for everything. So you would have a /16 for PROD, another one for DEV
    and another one for PREPROD etc.<br />Fully virtualized environment on ESX 4.1
    with Nexus 1000v and Juniper vGW (imagine the support nightmware once the vendor
    blame game bagan).<br />Next hop gateway for VMs was vrf interface on Nexus 7k
    for respective environment. And Load balancer hanging off in one-arm mode off
    the 7k and SNAT. No physical DMZ for web servers, Web and App were all on the
    same bunch of ESX servers and security controlled by vGW kernel firewall. Definitely
    a powerpoint design that made it into production (and still running &quot;somehow&quot;).<br
    />That being said I think this setup works but the moment you connect it to a
    traditional data center it becomes a huge mess. I can attest to it as I was there
    :). And to top it all off we had duplicate subnets in other environments protected
    by firewalls in the hope nobody would leak routes in and out of the respective
    &quot;bubble&quot;.
