Nevertheless these fault are not related to net complexity, but rather to user actions.<br />",

In practice, high-speed reasonable-cost linecards don&#39;t always support tunneling in hardware... and you&#39;d end up with a total mess of tunnels (not to mention the MTU issues).<br /><br />There are probably other considerations that I&#39;m not aware of as well - in any case, all big IXPs use L2 approach (and some new ones use customer-L2-over-transport-IP for internal stability) - either they&#39;re all stupid, or we&#39;re missing something ;)",

Of course it looks like a waste of ressources, but it would remove complexity from the IXP itself, making it even more robust\u2026",
