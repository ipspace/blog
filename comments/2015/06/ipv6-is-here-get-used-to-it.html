            <div class="comment-content">I can attest to that in a major globally known retail company. Management are of the belief that they can wait for &#39;others&#39; to change, then they&#39;ll follow.  IPv6 isn&#39;t even thought about or considered, the eCommerece mgmt team have no idea what IPv6. In the meantime management have said that we will be utilising the various transition mechanisms that surely will be put out there by providers to ensure that nobody is &#39;really&#39; cut off, despite them getting a poor quality experience.  It drives me mad!!</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&quot;You don’t need a business case for IPv6. It’s a business continuity solution.&quot;  <br /><br />Couldn&#39;t agree more!<br /><br />When developing our IPv6 consulting collateral 4 years ago, this was (and still is) my answer to the customer objection - &quot;but where&#39;s the business case&quot;.

            <div class="comment-content">There&#39;s nothing that prevents the Internet from relying solely on IPv4 for the next decade.<br /><br />IPv4 blocks are not actually scarce. Sure the RIRs are out of free IPv4 blocks, but there&#39;s still large quantities of unused IPv4. Is IPv4 space expensive? Possibly. So far it&#39;s cheaper than rolling out IPv6.<br /><br />Home internet users will get stuffed behind NAT and service providers will reallocate their IP block either to their own cloud services, or will hold their IPv4 allocations as ever-appreciating assets.<br /><br />A cloud service provider can charge $16/IP per month with IPv4. With IPv6, in theory, that income stream would go away. There&#39;s no end-to-end support for IPv6 yet in EC2, Azure, VMWare vCloud Air.<br /><br />I expect to see a contraction of IPv4 usage over the next decade as more business opt to run their internet facing data centers in &quot;the cloud.&quot;<br /><br />I love IPv6. I have been trying to find a company that would let me implement IPv6. But the business case of &quot;business continuity&quot; falls flat. No one is out of IPv4 space. It just costs money to get more IPs now.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&quot;There&#39;s nothing that prevents the Internet from relying solely on IPv4 for the next decade.&quot;<br /><br />You must be living in a nice bubble. I can tell you stories about cloud services not being launched because they SP could not get IP addresses, SP nightmares due to NAT-related logging (required by the law), other SP nightmares because they cannot use NAT logging (triggered by privacy concerns) and yet cannot get new IP addresses for their customers, enterprises becoming Internet Registries (LIRs) just to get a /22...<br /><br />Obviously nothing along these lines would ever persuade people living in total denial. In the meantime, as I wrote, the big players have moved on.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">IPv6 is must, The most obvious answer is that IPv4 is out of IP addresses. IPv4 has only 4.3 billion addresses, and with PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming systems, and just about everything else connecting to the Internet we&#39;ve tapped the system dry. IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses and is capable of 340 undecillion addresses.<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">IPV4 is not out of addresses.<br />My company has a /16.  We have among 2 groups .. maybe 70 or so entries in our DNS.  If other folks were even 1% of the usage rate we do that would be 200+ Billion devices and not even many of those need to talk to anything outside their local network.<br /><br />Not a single non-DMZ natted device on my networ needs a unique Internet addressable address so why worry about giving them one.<br /><br />I own a /20 from the 90s I am not using - I am sure that there are many companies and individuals like me.<br /><br />We&#39;re not out of IPV4 - we are out of easy IPV4.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Being out of easy IPv4 is effectively being out of IPv4. Even if all the hard IPv4 could be recovered it wouldn&#39;t be enough for future demands. <br /><br />There are sufficient drivers for IPv6 to eventually have all ISPs and Mobile operators providing it. Content providers will deploy it too to optimise their site performance. Eventually enterprise networks will get on board but by then it will already be inevitable.</div>
