And huge document to read at once;) They also admit the existence and rationale of hybrid approach where the existing distributed control plane is enhanced by &#39;centralized controller&#39; (following your vocabulary). They also mentioned classical approach shortcomings (scalability &amp; resilience issues). Seems to be very close to your opinions about the SDN.",

Centralized calculation of reachability and topology is what most people think of when they think &quot;SDNs.&quot; I&#39;ve started using the term &quot;programmable network,&quot; as a stand in for solutions that centralize policy while distributing reachability calculation, and the like. We definitely need a divide that will make this stuff scalable, but we&#39;re not really _thinking_ about what that divide should look like.<br /><br />We&#39;re just running around centralizing willy nilly. We need to sit for a spell and think about what it is we&#39;re trying to do, and why.",

      "html": "Centralized management has of course existed since the dawn of time.  I remain confused regarding centralizing &quot;policy&quot; or control-plane functions; specifically what happens when a network node receives an incoming data packet or frame.  Does the node have to hold the packet, communicate with the SDN controller via OpenFlow, wait for a pass / fail message (a la RADIUS), then forward the actual packet(s)?  Or, is the concept to have a single gigantic &quot;policy&quot; / ACL for the entire network which gets pushed down to every poor little network element?  I feel like I&#39;m missing some key concepts driving the SDN bandwagon.",

Whether it&#39;s bandwidth management, path computation or &quot;service stitching&quot; for example, provisioning vxlan overlays and mpls vpn with path/quality control together to provide a higher service offering, the need is to understand each device and it&#39;s capabilities in an overall system.   For a long time OpenFlow and control plane have taken most of the oxygen out of the room. As focus shifts from the limitations of OpenFlow/control plane the focus is going to centralized service orchestration.    The key of successful orchestration is being able to straddle newer and older technologies.   Service Orchestration by nature is never green field.   ",
