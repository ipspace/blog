    html: There is significant issue with single forwarding VLAN.Single L2 domain.When
      that one breaks,everything falls apart.Butterfly effect:)

  html: I looked at Calico from an enterprise perspective i.e. no multi-tenancy. What
    I liked was turning the hypervisor into a router and exchanging host routes with
    the ToR. I also liked the direct connectivity between virtual machines and physical
    servers whether they are databases, or backup systems, etc. without a need for
    an overlay connecting to a gateway of some sort. <br /><br />I do think scalability
    could be limited with all the host routes being advertised into the core switching
    environment. As you stated, summarization at the ToR, could be an answer. <br
    /><br />You note that you have a concern with IP forwarding in Linux. Would this
    be similar to the performance of a vxlan gateway in kernel in a hypervisor such
    as ESX? <br /><br />All in all, I thought it was a clever solution to avoid an
    overlay network deployment. For my enterprise though, it is not going to work
    in the near future since we have standardized on VMware.

  html: 'I also looked at it, but without a multi-tenant control/forwarding plane
    it&#39;s kind of a non-starter these days.   I haven&#39;t kept up but 6WIND was
    going to contribute changes to Quagga to support VRFs through Linux network namespaces.  On
    the Quagga side it could be represented by a different physical interface or VLAN
    or whatever.  '

      packet forwarding diagrams.

  html: Thanks for picking up this topic.<br /><br />Is Callico basically host routing
    per tenant with some proxy ARP on the vRouter ? Would be great if a network picture
    could be added to this article to make it clearer.<br /><br />Does Amazon VPC
    do the same thing alongwith some type of MPLS VPN/ EVPN ?<br /><br />

  html: 'Very interesting read.  We are actually using Calico at our Bare Metal servers
    for our front-ended Elastic Cloud Routers we deploy.  We are a pure L3 design
    where we do eBGP from the Calico/BIRD container on the BMS up to the LEAF, and
    then iBGP up to the SPINE.  Route-Reflection and all the like is in place, so
    scalability is there.  Our workloads are able to spin up fine etc..  The key for
    us though, is we aren&#39;t a multi-tenant environment for the edge use case.  It&#39;s
    purely for ingest.  I&#39;m really looking forward to seeing where they take Calico
    over the years, and also if they focus solely on the container world, or lean
    more towards OpenStack integration and beef up their Neutron integrations.   '

    html: Focus on what you need as the transport network between the hypervisor hosts.

  html: I&#39;m confused on the single flat VLAN you are referring to.  It&#39;s possible
    to build multiple subnets using Calico.
