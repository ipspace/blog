  html: Blogs is one of my main resources for finding writing on technology and configuration
    examples which very often surpass the vendors own writing in quality.<br /><br
    />Every now and then I find something and I go &quot;Wow, I can&#39;t believe
    I haven&#39;t found this resource before&quot; because the writing is so good.
    There are some hidden gems out there which stay hidden because they probably don&#39;t
    rank well in search results or the author is not on Twitter etc.

  html: There are a million and one blog posts about all sorts of networking topics.  I
    started my own humble blog (with just nine posts so far) with content that I felt
    I haven&#39;t been able to find else where on the Internet and something that
    I hope fellow network engineers are able to find useful.<br /><br />http://blog.salmannaqvi.com<br
    /><br />I am pretty much using it as a repository of unique and interesting items
    that I&#39;ve come across or have been working on.  Trying to stick to the &#39;be
    useful&#39; mantra.  No point replicating what others have already done as that&#39;s
    not productive or useful.

  html: Totally agree with your points.<br /><br />I started mine when I was studying
    for CCIE R&amp;S back in 2011.<br />Unfortunately/fortunately that time I was
    vendor-locked by Cisco, but now I&#39;m trying to write more vendor-neutral and
    share my own understanding and experience with different platforms.<br /><br />Soon,
    I will also start writing about Check Point ;-)<br /><br />Feel free to take a
    look and I definitely appreciate anyone&#39;s comment:<br />www.1cisco.com<br
    /><br />P.S. I&#39;m looking for a co-author. If anyone is interested, do not
    hesitate to contact me.

    html: I&#39;m positive you have plenty of stories to tell based on your 30 years
      of networking. &quot;How a networking engineer gets started with Linux and Python&quot;
      is probably another good one.

  html: I have thought about it a few times,- but always come to the conclusion I
    haven&#39;t anything interesting to tell :-)<br /><br />I do have 30 years of
    telecom and networking behind me,- I have fought countless battles, -designing,
    documenting, troubleshooting, teaching a lot, configuring, a lot of lab work,
    R&amp;D, ... PABX, PDH, SDH, Sonet, WDM, all kinds of large ISP cores and customer
    networks. <br />It&#39;s all boring me now,- sticks my head more into Linux, programming
    (mostly Python) and trying out SDN.<br /><br />But I&#39;m just a engineer, my
    story is probably quite boring,- I spare you for another blog,- but you are interesting
    to follow, always deep thoughts and humor, Ivan :-)

  html: "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I read a lot of great networking blogers online, but\
    \ you are surely the most persistent one. It&#39;s sometimes disturbing to see\
    \ how much there is. You site is my daily remainder on how little I know about\
    \ networking even now after few really complicated networking certs :)  <br /><br\
    \ />For me blogging started as 100% of \u201Clet\u2019s document what I just did\
    \ because I don\u2019t trust my long-term memory\u201D :)<br />I started to take\
    \ some basic notes online about things that were of most interest to me in time\
    \ of CCNP studies years ago. It was intended to be for my personal use only, easily\
    \ available online. After a while, my blog became my main point of reference trough\
    \ CCIE studies, other were using it too. It was great to see some readers feedback.\
    \ Now, five years later I still enjoy finding out more about networking and theory\
    \ behind algorithms that are running in the background. I&#39;m still trying to\
    \ put the most interesting topics online for myself and others to use. To be sincere,\
    \ I am probably still my most loyal reader :)<br /><br />You can check it out\
    \ at howdoesinternetwork.com"
