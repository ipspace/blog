  html: Thanks Ivan for the post. Indeed there are many customers who could not cross
    the mental bridge that it is doable. It kinda reminds me of the 4-minute mile
    barrier :-)<br />Have a great day!<br />e1

    html: Tom,<br /><br />Thanks for the comment. I know I&#39;m always missing something,
      and you just pointed out yet another caveat. Let me explore this a bit further.<br
      /><br />Kind regards,<br />Ivan

      updated my blog with an acknowledgement to your correction (and thank you for
      that), and link back to this post so readers can see your comment. <br /><br

    html: 'It becomes an even bigger concern if you are factoring co-lo into your
      international footprint. We were designing regional data hubs for a large enterprise
      that required very dense VM footprint with a minimal network edge. It wasn&#39;t
      1,000 VMs per rack, but it did require 30kw. In the US, we found that most of
      the big shops would accommodate us. In EMEA and APAC... our selection was extremely
      small and in some cases it was treated as a custom job and priced accordingly.
      We even used a co-lo broker to help us locate willing providers. (This was a
      few years ago, it might be better now.)<br /><br />As an early adopter of vBlock,
      we can concur with Ivan&#39;s point: you can build a very dense network with
      a surprisingly small footprint, especially if you&#39;re willing to leverage
      VM-based ADCs/Firewalls/Routers'

  html: 'Ivan,<br /><br />I&#39;m disappointed that I don&#39;t see any mention in
    that post about my primary concern for those types of racks: power and cooling.
    AnandTech suggests the Xeon 2699v3 uses around 175 watts (TDP is 145 watts). That
    means that, just for CPUs, rack power is 19.6 kilowatts, when you throw in motherboards,
    RAM, drives, etc, 30 kilowatts for a rack doesn&#39;t seem out of the question,
    especially factoring in two switches. 30kw is not un-doable in this day and age,
    but caveat emptor if you buy this and find out your datacenter only budgeted for
    8kw per rack.<br /><br />'

    html: 'A typical enterprise virtualization engineer would faint at what you&#39;re
      suggesting ;) But yeah, I agree with you - those numbers are definitely reachable
      if you&#39;re pushing the envelope (and let me guess: most of the VMs probably
      have 4GB of RAM or so, right?)'

  html: 1000?  you&#39;re thinking too small :-)<br />I work for a cloud provider,
    we shove 250 VMs per HV, and 40 HVs per rack.  Try 10,000 VMs per rack :-)
