  html: Here - http://packetpushers.net/podcast/podcasts/show-249-juniper-qfx-dc-fabrics-automation-sponsored/<br
    />Juniper sad satellite devices SUPPORT local switching. <br /><br />and because
    you have to change the JunOS to Yocto Linux on the satellite devices it is not
    real PnP. )<br /><br />and what about troubleshooting on sattelite? - different
    OS and tools. FEX runs NXOS.<br /><br />BTW QFX5100 is about $40K ))) 40K for
    a dumb device....

  html: More like Fusion is FEX done right. OP left out that you can run different
    software versions between all nodes and doesn&#39;t require a huge maintenance
    window to upgrade the entire fabric. Fusion also supports automatic LACP creation
    for servers and auto-senses VLANs on server-facing trunks.
