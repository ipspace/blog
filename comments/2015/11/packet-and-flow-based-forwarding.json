This ARP-be-damned forwarding can lead to very desirable steady-state forwarding behavior, but it&#39;s a liability to planned &amp; unplanned changes since each device has its own idea of how to deal with topology changes.

It seems to me that the main difference is where you update the forwarding tables from. With PBR, a network guy configures a layer-3 device to make layer-4-7 decisions, whereas with OF, someone makes a selection at the app layer (whether by a portal or by programming within an app) which propagates to the layer-3 device. If you read the cheerleader fluff of openflow proponents, the supposed advantage is that you can initiate a flow from one place and it will propagate across many L3 devices as long as they are all compliant. If you do this from the network side, obviously it would require touching many devices, and frequently. Again, I just skimmed and may not have it all straight. Regarding Ivan&#39;s original point, I don&#39;t see how flows could exceed packet-based forwarding unless they are referring to the outcome... I.E. a SD-WAN decision to switch traffic to alternate paths based on performance whereas packet-based forwarding would never do this?",

      "html": "I submit that the real difference between packet and flows on the forwarding plane is that flows require the forwarder to be consistent amidst changes to the lookup table, whereas packets don&#39;t.  <br /><br />A router is flow agnostic and doesn&#39;t need to respect the flow when deciding which next-hop to assign to a packet to adjust to, for example, changes in the lookup table that happen between packets, whereas a load-balancer does need to arrive at the same next-hop decision over and over again for each packet in the flow or it risks breaking the flow.<br /><br />And this is more than PBR because it creates a unique entry for each flow, all of which are a match for the same PBR rule, allowing flow A to go to next-hop 1 and flow B to go to next-hop 2.  <br /><br />This is all still packet switching, but it is much more granular matches, which allows for much more granular actions and those actions can, because of the awareness of the flow context, do things that require the maintenance of state, particularly the state between a request and a response.  When you do that at L4 you have a stateful firewall.  When you do that at L7 or with the payload of L7, you have a load-balancer.  When you do it because you really wish your packet switched network was a voice circuit or a virtual wire or a video channel you have a problem.<br /><br />That doesn&#39;t absolve the original quote of it&#39;s shame, and in fact, this kind of network state is both very complicated to manage well and applicable to a shrinking number of must-use scenarios if sane technological decisions about things like ipv6 and network identity are made; we shouldn&#39;t be artificially increasing them, because they should be naturally decreasing over time.  <br /><br />(Of course, that quotes like that are not the consequence of sane technological decisions.)

Would you be able to comment on them:<br /><br />Forwarding-table size:<br />At the moment, local CP (RIB) gets downloaded to FIB and we get packet forwarding on a router. If we start evaluating too many fields (PBR) and (assume) are able to push these policies to the FIB - what would become of the FIB table size ?? Wouldnt an open-flow based switch go through the same scaling issue on its forwarding level if each flow was to be treated differently on the device ??<br /><br />Out-of-band channel:<br />If every device talking to a centralized control plane uses an out-of-band channel to talk to the openflow controller, isnt this a scaling concern?<br />And if devices dont use out-of-band channel to talk to the openflow controller, what will happen if a core link goes down affecting device &lt;&gt; controller communication? is it expected that the FIB of the device would already have a pre-programmed &quot;alternate&quot; or &quot;backup&quot; path computed and downloaded into it to be able to reroute packets? <br />Are we then talking about IP-FRR (which has topology restrictions) or LFA/RLFA ?.. <br />what do OF/SDN standards propose to mitigate this issue<br />Also, the response time from centralized controller for network events would not be the same as a local CP on the device",
