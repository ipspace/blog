      "html": "Acoustic networks have been used for quite a few years for underwater communications, mainly for military operations. Electromagnetic waves do not propagate well because of water absorption, but mechanic waves do. There was a nice pilot from the US army which deployed multiple devices in the late 90&#39;s called the Seaweb network (it was documented, for example, <a href=\"http://wuwnet07.engr.uconn.edu/slides/Seaweb_WUWNet_talk.ppt\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>), and there is much more work from recent years. Such networks employed a meshed topology, what would make IP relatively complex to use (but in any case, I guess that the original question messes OSI layers a bit, doesn&#39;t it?).",
