  html: This idea may have a market niche (chemical plants or something like that
    where electricity is avoided in specific areas).<br /><br />Not sure why I recalled:<br

  html: Or the next step in planted rootkits... Leaked NSA data showed something similar
    into out of band access on some HP models (even though it wasn&#39;t ultrasound
    but restricted wavelength on radio).

  html: Acoustic networks have been used for quite a few years for underwater communications,
    mainly for military operations. Electromagnetic waves do not propagate well because
    of water absorption, but mechanic waves do. There was a nice pilot from the US
    army which deployed multiple devices in the late 90&#39;s called the Seaweb network
    (it was documented, for example, <a href="http://wuwnet07.engr.uconn.edu/slides/Seaweb_WUWNet_talk.ppt"
    rel="nofollow">here</a>), and there is much more work from recent years. Such
    networks employed a meshed topology, what would make IP relatively complex to
    use (but in any case, I guess that the original question messes OSI layers a bit,
    doesn&#39;t it?).

  html: I have often wondered about using hydraulic hoses as an alternate form of
    networking with transducers for systems.  I wonder if a hydraulic CSMA/CD would
    work.

  html: This kind of stuff was envisioned in 1996.<br />https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1926<br
    />The ATM in title means &quot;Acoustical Transmission Media, i.e. sound waves&quot;
