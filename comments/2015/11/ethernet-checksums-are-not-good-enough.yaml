  html: "How does cut-through introduce a correct CRC when the incoming one fails?\
    \ If I understand correctly, the post by John Harrington says that cut-through\
    \ switches \u2018stomp\u2019 the outbound FCS when the inbound CRC fails, meaning\
    \ they forward a garbage (incorrect) FCS. It gets over all the network (since\
    \ you cannot un-forward the frame by the time you detect a corrupt CRC), but it\
    \ reaches the destination with an incorrect FCS. Shouldn&#39;t that be detected\
    \ by the iSCSI endpoint to discard the frame? Or is it that switches actually\
    \ calculate a new CRC when they route between different subnetworks, without &#39;stomping&#39;?"

  html: You are correct, CRC errors are detected even in case of cut-through switching.

      argument in Evan&#39;s post. Fixed.

  html: 'I wholeheartedly agree with the idea that one should not rely on the Ethernet
    or ip/tcp checksums to verify the integrity of your data. These things are very
    fast to check on a modern CPU and you can avoid incredibly hard bugs.<br /><br
    />It would be a serious bug for a cut-through switch to put a correct CRC on a
    frame that had an incorrect CRC upon reception and none of the cut through switches
    available since 2006 have had this bug. The real issue with cut-through and bad
    CRC is that they don&#39;t get dropped and keep using precious bandwidth, though
    in reality unless you have a lot of FCS errors in your network, this is not a
    big deal at all.<br /><br />Also note that Ip checksum is only on the header.
    TCP checksum covers the payload with a weak 16b ones complement checksum. So UDP
    packets basically rely only the ethernet CRC to protect the payload.<br /><br
    />What can happen very rarely is a piece of networking equipment could have some
    memory where some bits are stuck at 0 or 1. If that memory buffers packets after
    the CRC is checked and happens not to be protected with parity or ECC, packet
    payload is now corrupted and the networking equipment generates a new CRC that
    is correct for the corrupted payload. Here&#39;s a good description of such a
    failure from Edgecast ( Verizon CDN ):  <br /><br />https://www.verizondigitalmedia.com/blog/2015/02/being-good-stewards-of-the-internet/'
