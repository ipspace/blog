      "html": "Excellent analogy, and the &quot;here be dragons&quot; figure is timeless...I had a hand in a tool simplifying server management 30 years ago, and saw a case in storage management maybe 15 years ago, which both led to the exact user experience you predict for networks.<br /><br />There is a complicating factor here: the whole point of hyperconverged is delivering a simplified customer experience, competing not against traditional server/storage/network but against giving up on in-house data centers and outsourcing data center infrastructure to the cloud.<br /><br />The answer here isn&#39;t to put a simplistic user interface on the network we have today (&quot;lipstick on a pig&quot;, as it were).  It&#39;s also not to preserve the network silo, just as the storage business is learning that hyperconverged doesn&#39;t preserve SANs or the status quo in storage.<br /><br />Oh, and the DevOps world (whatever you call it) seems to have rejected the idea of networking as a black box which is maintained as a separate technology silo by a separate organizational silo.  What we see the Googles and Facebooks doing is at least as much about integrating network configuration and management into application configuration and management as it is about CapEx and vendor pricing.  This &quot;new world&quot; is rejecting the status quo, in the data center.<br /><br />Looking at this customer and competitive situation, my gut instinct is that the data center needs to evolve into 1000-server-size islands of networking which are truly simple and can be installed and operated by application centric people, joined at the backbone (or for the vast majority of installations/businesses to the WAN or campus network) by more traditional networking.  <br /><br />Whether these islands look more like (my employer, for whom I&#39;m not speaking here) Hewlett Packard Enterprise&#39;s Virtual Connect, or like Cisco&#39;s ACI, or something Intel cooks up around Omni-Path ... well, we&#39;ll all know by 2025.  But I do agree, &quot;here be dragons&quot; if we try to do this with the full complexity of today&#39;s data center networking.<br /><br />@FStevenChalmers<br />",
