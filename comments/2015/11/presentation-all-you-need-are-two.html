            <div class="comment-content">How about haproxy for a virtualized load balancer? I know you have a small post about it but I would like to have your opinion about it and why it should be avoided or if instead it could be a good choice.<br /><br />Thank you.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">When you step out of the SP world and in to the enterprise world you get a sense of what the true technology requirements are for the enterprise.  One of the first things you notice is how most enterprises have been disgustingly oversold by the SP&#39;s, hardware providers, and VARs.  The enterprise never wants to admit they were oversold and the SP/VAR would never admit to the opposite; so we&#39;re left with very few people out there who actually care about good design &amp; efficiency.  It&#39;s easy to spot the ones who care because they outperform everyone else by light years (Amazon, Google, etc)</div>
