      "html": "A few things are needed to fix routing in IPv6.<br /><br />First you need Locator-Identifier separation. E.g. some parts of ILNP or LISP or a variant of those proposals. This is needed as the foundation for all the fundamental fixes of routing that are needed. Applications-people don&#39;t understand this. And they keep suggesting bandaids. Unfortunately IPv6 in the nineties was developed by Applications-people. (The routing people were busy building the Internet, and making lots of money. The less successful people staged a coup and stole IPv6).<br /><br />Then you need CLNS-style routing inside Autonomous Systems. We know how to do that with link-state protocols. This will give you host multi-homing. It will give you easier addressing and renumbering and relocating hosts inside networks.<br /><br />Secondly you need some form locator-rewriting at the boundaries of each Autonomous System. This will give you site-multihoming. You can also call this NAT or NAT66. This word will make people cry. But it is the best solution. Because you had implemented locator-identifier separation earlier, hosts don&#39;t care. They care about Identifiers. They won&#39;t care if Locators change on the fly.<br /><br />Now what is needed to achieve this ? I don&#39;t know.<br />Once I asked about which of some two competing proposals would win. An old Russian guy told me: &quot;Deployment tends to win&quot;.<br /><br />So I could envision a simple strategy.<br />1) You need to get 3 big router vendors aboard of the proposal. Cisco, Alcatel, Juniper might be enough.<br />2) You need 3 host-vendors aboard. MicroSoft, Apple and maybe Google (Android). Someone needs to write a Linux driver too.<br /><br />These 6 parties implement the changes I proposed. You can call it IPv6\u00bd if you want to. Their largest customers get it deployed. Only then you start writing RFCs. Problem solved. Would this be possible ?",
