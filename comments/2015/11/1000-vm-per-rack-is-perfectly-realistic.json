          "html": "It becomes an even bigger concern if you are factoring co-lo into your international footprint. We were designing regional data hubs for a large enterprise that required very dense VM footprint with a minimal network edge. It wasn&#39;t 1,000 VMs per rack, but it did require 30kw. In the US, we found that most of the big shops would accommodate us. In EMEA and APAC... our selection was extremely small and in some cases it was treated as a custom job and priced accordingly. We even used a co-lo broker to help us locate willing providers. (This was a few years ago, it might be better now.)<br /><br />As an early adopter of vBlock, we can concur with Ivan&#39;s point: you can build a very dense network with a surprisingly small footprint, especially if you&#39;re willing to leverage VM-based ADCs/Firewalls/Routers",

      "html": "Ivan,<br /><br />I&#39;m disappointed that I don&#39;t see any mention in that post about my primary concern for those types of racks: power and cooling. AnandTech suggests the Xeon 2699v3 uses around 175 watts (TDP is 145 watts). That means that, just for CPUs, rack power is 19.6 kilowatts, when you throw in motherboards, RAM, drives, etc, 30 kilowatts for a rack doesn&#39;t seem out of the question, especially factoring in two switches. 30kw is not un-doable in this day and age, but caveat emptor if you buy this and find out your datacenter only budgeted for 8kw per rack.<br /><br />",
