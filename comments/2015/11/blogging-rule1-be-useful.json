There are some hidden gems out there which stay hidden because they probably don&#39;t rank well in search results or the author is not on Twitter etc.",

You site is my daily remainder on how little I know about networking even now after few really complicated networking certs :)  <br /><br />For me blogging started as 100% of \u201clet\u2019s document what I just did because I don\u2019t trust my long-term memory\u201d :)<br />I started to take some basic notes online about things that were of most interest to me in time of CCNP studies years ago. It was intended to be for my personal use only, easily available online. After a while, my blog became my main point of reference trough CCIE studies, other were using it too. It was great to see some readers feedback. Now, five years later I still enjoy finding out more about networking and theory behind algorithms that are running in the background. I&#39;m still trying to put the most interesting topics online for myself and others to use. To be sincere, I am probably still my most loyal reader :)<br /><br />You can check it out at howdoesinternetwork.com",
