    html: I&#39;ve encountered multiple cases where choosing competing vendor Y over
      established vendor X immediately made the latter much more flexible both in
      terms of pricing and support (bugfix turnaround time and new feature rollouts).
      <br /><br />While having multiple vendors does add operational and logistic
      headaches, it gives the freedom or choice and allows for finding path out of
      &#39;dead-ends&#39; like those created by some platform Z :) This, by far, out-weights
      the above mentioned headaches, while minimizing risks for business, just as
      with any properly managed diversification. <br /><br />The general conclusion
      is that it&#39;s natural for a vendor to be unresponsive and arrogant when it
      fully &quot;owns&quot; the customer - just like in case of any monopoly. That&#39;s
      just how things seem to work after all. Could it be different? Maybe - in a
      perfect world :)

    html: Unfortunately those same business people often suddenly decide to go with
      the second vendor due to an enticing New Year Special, and blame the IT folks
      when they cannot do that because someone created a lock-in when trying to solve
      business problems with insufficient budget or when faced with clueless demands
      (follow-the-sun VM mobility comes to mind).<br /><br />Don&#39;t blame the people
      who happen to think two steps ahead for not buying a particularly shiny proprietary
      gadget ;)

    html: In the server world, there is &quot;lock in&quot;, but the fact that OS&#39;s
      and hardware are based on a well-defined standard (the x86 PC) means that users
      can choose to change hardware vendors without changing software vendors, and
      vice versa.  This significantly reduces the effect of &quot;lock in&quot; in
      many practical ways.<br /><br />Networking is going through this same transformation
      now with &quot;white box&quot; switches and standardizing on hardware designs
      like Open Compute Project (OCP) switches.  Open Network Linux (recently adopted
      by OCP as an official project) will also open up an avenue for people to treat
      their commodity white box switch hardware like they have treated their x86 Linux
      servers.<br /><br />This is a very practical and real way in which &quot;lock
      in&quot; will lessen in the next few years as this disaggregation of software
      and hardware in networking becomes more prevalent ...<br />

    html: In the past I worked 22 years at my country&#39;s major Telecom/ISP.<br
      /><br />We always used a at least 2-vendor politics in every tech. WDM, PDH,
      SDH, IP, Voice etc.<br /><br />Very effective to keep prices down, service up
      and the vendor representatives on their toes. When one got too arrogant, just
      mention the competitor&#39;s name, then the impossible suddenly got possible.<br
      /><br />Of course, keep away from proprietary solutions, or keep them at least  revertible
      without huge impact.

    html: 'Strangely enough, the next step of vendor lock-in comes from your own company.<br
      />Over time, one develops systems to maintain, administer, troubleshoot, communicate,
      supervice, capacity plan everything.<br />Suddenly you find, that the money
      spared implementing a new and better vendor will be eaten several times,- because
      of expenses used to re-program and adjust your own tools to keep the engine
      running. So you&#39;re vendor locked again. <br /><br />Keep your own system
      open and don&#39;t let the vendors know too much about your business. They&#39;re
      good at smelling problems. '

  html: Amen.  How about focusing on solving your business problems instead of worrying
    about being &#39;locked in&#39; ?<br /><br />The business couldn&#39;t care less
    about &#39;lock in&#39; - in fact most business people would be happy to be locked
    in to a technology that is solving their problems.<br /><br />It seems to be the
    IT folks who must appear to be the smartest people in the room at every meeting
    who worry about this kind of nonsense like lock in.<br /><br />Just solve the
    problem you&#39;re trying to solve in a cost effective, supportable, and consistent
    manner.  <br /><br />[ Disclaimer - I work for a vendor in case you couldn&#39;t
    tell =) ]

  html: '1) Decentralize. The more central a product to the network, the more likely
    it is to get ingrained and enable lock-in. The distributed internet is not locked
    in to any vendor. The centralized world of Telcos and OSMINE certificed OSSs was
    fairly locked in to the OSS vendor (Bellcore).<br /><br />Or alternately use truly
    open source + home grown management products in central locations.<br /><br />2)
    Use vendor A in zone A/ region A. Use vendor B in zone B/ region B. Threaten to
    increase or decrease their footprint based on performance. Now you can live with
    lock-in within the regions and yet have leverage against the vendor. Not all networks
    can afford to do this however (because it may mean two sets of admin teams unless
    there is frequent knowledge sharing and talent rotation).<br /><br /><br />Disclaimer:
    Opinions are strictly mine alone.<br />'

  html: Your architectural guiding principal should be to adopt solutions that are
    open, flexible and compatible with leading vendors. You can MITIGATE vendor lock
    in, not eliminate it. As some have pointed out, sometimes the business is presented
    a deal they can&#39;t refuse. Sometimes the business demands something (let&#39;s
    say, automation and programmability) and the cost of going with a new solution
    is much higher than modifying your existing solution, even though the new solution
    would be far better. You then just dig deeper and become more entwined with your
    vendor.<br /><br />On the flipside, if you choose your PAAS stack wisely, you
    can transparently switch server and storage vendors (knock on wood). If you choose
    your orchestration wisely, you can phase new hypervisor vendors in and phase old
    ones out more or less painlessly, as well as burst externally.<br /><br />But
    if you just drink the cool aid and accept every single thing a single vendor sells
    you under the auspices of &quot;holistic integration&quot;, you will find that
    you cannot introduce new products quickly or easily.

  html: 'Many years ago we decided to use well-known brand of switches. Then we decided
    to use some unique features from this vendor. Perfect vendor lock-in!<br /><br
    />This year happened something even WORSE than vendor lock-in: this vendor took
    over another company and decided to replace its switches with newly bought toys.<br
    /><br />Guess what? These new switches are not compatible with the original switches
    we have been using for years and we need to redesign our product just because
    our vendor cannot deliver old features. We did not want to change the vendor BUT
    the vendor changed itself causing huge problems for us.'
