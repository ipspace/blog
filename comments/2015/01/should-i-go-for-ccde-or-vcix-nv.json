It&#39;s also new and exciting - which makes the learning process fun and rewarding as well.  No matter who wins or establishes themselves in the SDN race, VMware&#39;s solution would undoubtedly be one of the must-know solutions.<br />",

If you can study for 3 months and knock out a VCIX then I think it ends up with the rest of the certification garbage.<br /><br />AFAIK CCDE has the same rigour as the CCIE program in terms of difficulty and study time.",

CCDE is more of a certification focussed on in deep understanding of routing protocols and mpls applications. It&#39;s really about knowing about WHY ? behind preparing a solution and it&#39;s impact in overall network which CCIE is certainly not focussed on.<br /><br />So to me CCDE is kind of CCIE +<br /><br />VMware certifications are focussed on modern approaches to build and scale networks using virtualization, overlays and magical cloud word. So in that sense it would perhaps make more sense to compare it with something like CCIE DC and how learning more about VMware stuff help you build skillset in that area. There are still tons of things that for example you will find on CCIE DC blueprint which pure VMware guy might not have much or detailed idea about.<br /><br />so perhaps NV is better track to go after CCIE DC IMHO.",

Unfortunately, there is truth to that statement - due to cheating and braindumping, etc.<br /><br />Regardless, CCIEs have AMAZING value - the real ones that is - which I would argue are far, far greater in number than the fake CCIEs.  And luckily, you can tell the fake one apart from a real CCIE in about 5 minutes or less in an interview/discussion.<br /><br />Considering that, I would continue to recommend it to others as I don&#39;t know ANY other &quot;investment&quot; that has better ROI than CCIEs.  Work hard, earn it, and then reap the benefits!  Typical CCIE takes 2000 to 3000 hours worth of effort - and more for some people.  If you study properly, with rack rentals and your own lab, it typically takes multiple attempts, and will typically set you back $10,000-30,000.  It&#39;s an enormous undertaking that requires a lot of dedication.  However, once you have it, you never have to worry about being unemployed again.  And you typically make your investment in it back in less than 2-3 months of working in a CCIE role.",

Now i have my 4 years kid i no longer have the luxury of having the same kind of dedication again.<br /><br />Anyway,thanks for the post and the comments. i really enjoyed read it.",
