  html: 'One more automated mechanism is to used class-based tunnel selection (called
    PBTS I believe in newer XR) and class-based forwarding in Junos.  Each will map
    incoming traffic to a specific LSP based on class of service.   Typically you
    should use auto-bandwidth and also use different setup/hold priorities along with
    preemption to ensure the high priority traffic always takes precedent at an LSP
    level.  Below that you would still make sure EXPs are marked correctly so per-hop
    QoS can drop what it needs.  <br /><br />DS-TE makes your interface-level QoS
    configuration and LSP configuration congruent.   The IGP will advertise specific
    amounts of bandwidth as configured in the QoS configuration for each hop along
    the network.  So if your lower path is configured for 0% BE and 100% EF, the data
    LSP would never traverse it during a failure.  I&#39;ve rarely seen anyone implement
    DS-TE in a production network.  '
