            <div class="comment-content">Interesting to see where the debate goes not only for traffic flow policy but for network management as well. I try to look at it in 3 main functional categories.<br /><br />Control/Data plane FSMs controlled by a centralized source distributed to all devices.(True SDN/NFV - devices - whiteboxes) <br /><br />Control/Data plane separated but still controlled individually by per device FSM, (fat/smart boxes)<br /><br />Control/Data plane separated but hybrid version of some control centralized some distributed per device FSM and some data plane centralized and some distributed per device FSM(think of that split mac wireless type of application - light boxes) <br /><br />For the classic distributed per device FSM control/data plane types it is  fixed and known for behavior and timers per device&#39;s protocols FSM. Think PHB. <br /><br /> The centralized to distributed version adds a delta of time, another protocol to inform the per device type FSMs of a change. <br /><br />You gain an ease of management/provisioning but also risk as you mentioned the blast radius but also risk the performance delta of any flow related change getting communicated to all devices in time in order etc.vs. the classical time consumption of PHB device provisioning at any layer of the stack for the rigid consistency but micro impact.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
