  html: A set of tools to prepare configuration to ease renumebering has been proposed
    in http://inl.info.ucl.ac.be/publications/preparing-network-configurations-ipv6-renumbering<br
    />Unfortunately, I&#39;m not aware of any vendor/operator who has adopted this
    kind of solutions

  html: 'I do second the view &quot;DNS is the way to go&quot;, though there are a
    few obstacles, which do require careful software engineering.<br /><br />For client
    applications, software infrastructure often gives poor defaults to developers.
    E.g. when using a security manager, Java defaults to an infinite DNS-cache-timeout:
    changed DNS-records won&#39;t be recognized by a running application. One answer:
    reconfigure Java&#39;s cache-timeout to a few seconds, add a  DNS resolver on
    loopback and let this resolver implement handling of DNS-TTLs correctly. If your
    DNS server can handle up to a thousandfold of requests (when moving from 24h-TTLs
    to sub-minute-TTLs), you may also avoid the loopback resolver.<br /><br />For
    server applications, the situation isn&#39;t that shiny as well; if a software
    is asked to listen on the IP address of some FQDN, it will most likely resolve
    this record on startup only, bind to ip/port and drop (root) privileges. If the
    DNS-record changes, it may sound reasonable to temporarily listen on both old
    and new IP - but doing so requires the application to listen to multiple IPs at
    the same time (not everybody can do this) or requires just those dropped privileges,
    and depending on the actual implementation and reason for the DNS change, this
    could result in inconsistent behaviour to clients or similar issues. It is still
    doable (proxies, port forwarders, specific application code, ...), though this
    is a lot harder than &quot;just change DNS&quot;.'
