          "html": "I&#39;ve encountered multiple cases where choosing competing vendor Y over established vendor X immediately made the latter much more flexible both in terms of pricing and support (bugfix turnaround time and new feature rollouts). <br /><br />While having multiple vendors does add operational and logistic headaches, it gives the freedom or choice and allows for finding path out of &#39;dead-ends&#39; like those created by some platform Z :) This, by far, out-weights the above mentioned headaches, while minimizing risks for business, just as with any properly managed diversification. <br /><br />The general conclusion is that it&#39;s natural for a vendor to be unresponsive and arrogant when it fully &quot;owns&quot; the customer - just like in case of any monopoly. That&#39;s just how things seem to work after all. Could it be different? Maybe - in a perfect world :)",

          "html": "In the server world, there is &quot;lock in&quot;, but the fact that OS&#39;s and hardware are based on a well-defined standard (the x86 PC) means that users can choose to change hardware vendors without changing software vendors, and vice versa.  This significantly reduces the effect of &quot;lock in&quot; in many practical ways.<br /><br />Networking is going through this same transformation now with &quot;white box&quot; switches and standardizing on hardware designs like Open Compute Project (OCP) switches.  Open Network Linux (recently adopted by OCP as an official project) will also open up an avenue for people to treat their commodity white box switch hardware like they have treated their x86 Linux servers.<br /><br />This is a very practical and real way in which &quot;lock in&quot; will lessen in the next few years as this disaggregation of software and hardware in networking becomes more prevalent ...<br />",

      "html": "1) Decentralize. The more central a product to the network, the more likely it is to get ingrained and enable lock-in. The distributed internet is not locked in to any vendor. The centralized world of Telcos and OSMINE certificed OSSs was fairly locked in to the OSS vendor (Bellcore).<br /><br />Or alternately use truly open source + home grown management products in central locations.<br /><br />2) Use vendor A in zone A/ region A. Use vendor B in zone B/ region B. Threaten to increase or decrease their footprint based on performance. Now you can live with lock-in within the regions and yet have leverage against the vendor. Not all networks can afford to do this however (because it may mean two sets of admin teams unless there is frequent knowledge sharing and talent rotation).<br /><br /><br />Disclaimer: Opinions are strictly mine alone.<br />",

      "html": "Your architectural guiding principal should be to adopt solutions that are open, flexible and compatible with leading vendors. You can MITIGATE vendor lock in, not eliminate it. As some have pointed out, sometimes the business is presented a deal they can&#39;t refuse. Sometimes the business demands something (let&#39;s say, automation and programmability) and the cost of going with a new solution is much higher than modifying your existing solution, even though the new solution would be far better. You then just dig deeper and become more entwined with your vendor.<br /><br />On the flipside, if you choose your PAAS stack wisely, you can transparently switch server and storage vendors (knock on wood). If you choose your orchestration wisely, you can phase new hypervisor vendors in and phase old ones out more or less painlessly, as well as burst externally.<br /><br />But if you just drink the cool aid and accept every single thing a single vendor sells you under the auspices of &quot;holistic integration&quot;, you will find that you cannot introduce new products quickly or easily.",
