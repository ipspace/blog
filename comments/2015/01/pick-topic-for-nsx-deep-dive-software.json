Presumably this would require partnerships with hardware networking vendors and/or release of their own network operating system. Is any of this on their roadmap?",

Did you choose NSX over ACI on your private cloud?<br /><br />Fantastic. Please share the business drivers and technical requirements that led you to those decisions. What were the adoption hurdles? Did your CIO simply pick your solution for you, or did you do a bakeoff between several vendors? Was cost the primary driver or was it features (such as automation)? Or the support model?<br /><br />Let&#39;s face it... we all talk to vendors and get their sales pitch. We all read tech blogs and news sites to get the latest emerging trends. Some of us talk to Gartner and other sites to get their opinions. But the community of network engineers is lacking a good way to share success/horror stories that would help other engineers who are about to go down that same path.<br /><br />",
