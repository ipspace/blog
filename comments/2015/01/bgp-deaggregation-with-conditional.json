So I assume that in a case of DC1-2 Link failure, you don&#39;t get the subnet anymore, so your deaggregation does not work anymore. So your more-specific prefixes will not be advertised, so you cannot go from DC1 to DC2. <br /><br />Ivan could you clarify things for us? Thanks",

With default routes (solves issues with same AS) from upstream it provides connectivity between DC1 and DC2.<br /><br />Not saying its nice, pretty or appropriate as the AS is split.
