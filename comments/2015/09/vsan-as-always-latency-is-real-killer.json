          "html": "It is buffered on the SSD which is persistent on both sides. And yes the network latency stands, but you remove the drive latency.<br /><br />That was not the point I was trying to get across. I do think that customers are concerned about latency, at the same time they are concerned about availability. It is for them to figure out what is more important.",

      "html": "I think what you guys forgot is that Virtual SAN always writes to SSD. That is how the architecture has been designed from the start. We take advantage of the SSD, buffer the writes and then destage them when needed. The write is acknowledged to the Guest OS / Application as soon as it hits the SSD buffer. So the latency for a write to a device like this will not be 2ms but much lower than that.<br /><br />I understand what he is trying to say, but we are forgetting that we are trying to solve a business problem here. Any stretched storage platform has the same challenge when it comes to latency, yet NetApp Metro, EMC VPLEX, 3Par etc etc are still relatively popular solutions. Why? Well simply because in many cases it is 10x easier to provide this level of resiliency through an infrastructure level solution rather than to rely on 3rd party application providers to change their full architecture to provide you the resiliency you need. As you know getting large vendors to change their application architecture isn&#39;t easy, and can take years... if at all.<br /><br />These types of solutions are developed for relatively short distances, and still relatively low latency. Sure it has been validated to be able to incur a hit of 5ms, that doesn&#39;t mean that from a customer point of view this would be acceptable. That decision is up to the customer. Same applies to bandwidth, what can your afford, what is available in your region / between sites etc.<br /><br />Stretched infrastructures are not easy to architect, or deploy for that matter, but I truly believe with Virtual SAN we made the storage aspects 10x easier to manage and deploy than they have ever been before.",

I am not sure what the point is people are trying to make with discussions like these. It is not like it is easy to get a whole application architecture changed. ",

      "html": "And the latency of an SSD is *not* 0.1 ms under non-trivial workload. Think more like 1 ms for a 4K write. So, add the network latency between the two sites (vmware&#39;s recommendation is &lt; 5 ms RTT) to 1 ms. That&#39;s the price to pay if you want rpo=0 and protection from a site failure.  There is no free lunch with the physics of this universe.",
