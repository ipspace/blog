I remember deploying my first machine on AWS years ago and I couldn&#39;t reach it after I knew it was up.  Needed to explicitly white list who could access the system.  While, you could do an &quot;allow all&quot;, it at least makes you think who/what needs access.  Oh, you need a LB, search Amazon docs and figure out how to set it up :)  ...so yeah, let&#39;s follow the Amazon process.",

      "html": "&quot;Furthermore, you should encourage the application teams to deploy their own network services (load balancing and firewalling) on demand. This drastic change in perspective usually results in faster deployments and more flexible environment, but also in a total shift of responsibilities.&quot;<br /><br />Have you actually seen enterprises doing this? I ask, because as you said it is both easier, and a total shift in responsibilities and I agree wholeheartedly. However, I have never (and I emphasize never) seen an app owner understand their network requirements. They have been unable to fill out simple forms, and generally takes much hand holding to fill out said simple form. <br /><br />Almost every security form comes with access is required with &quot;access is required bidirectionally.&quot; <br /><br />Q. Really, it&#39;s tcp who sends the TCP SYN?<br />A. What??<br />Q. Who initiates the session?<br />A. Hmm, let me ask the vendor/programmer, etc..<br />Q. How do you know you need this access?<br />A. It&#39;s running slow. <br />Q. OK, let start from the beginning. ",

      "html": "&quot; I have never (I emphasize never) seen an app owner understand their network requirements.&quot;<br /><br />People have a finite amount of time in their work week. If they are judged on delivering features and learning new toolkits, they aren&#39;t going to spend their time trying to understand something they are not judged on. If you push the load balancing and networking responsibility on to their teams, they they will spend time to understand it and will get better at it. I don&#39;t know RIP because I never had to use it. I know way more than I want about  snmp because I *had* to learn it to get something done. <br /><br />Another side benefit of team supported infrastructure in the cloud is unlike a traditional datacenter, where there is tons of lateral network access to jump thru, most teams are isolated. If they screwup their security posture, that&#39;s a problem, but it only affects them, not the rest of the company. You touched upon it in the article, but in a large company it&#39;s a huge advantage over a datacenter where you have to be a fascist about any change that affects security postures. ",
