  html: Saw this the other day. Interesting topic.<br /><br />My multicast applications
    are mostly low rate and small packet size. Do you have any idea of average packet
    size for multicast applications such as IPTV? Or what kind of applications would
    this be a problem in?

  html: 'In our environment we prefer having DF set on IPTV multicast stream mainly
    for two reasons:<br /><br />- bad configured intermediate device might process
    switching due to fragmentation and reassembly and we&#39;d like to avoid high
    cpu issues or latency on real time flows.<br /><br />- any MTU config mistakes
    can be easily discovered (TV flow is not received), '

  html: 'A number of stock exchanges use a protocol called FAST for market data delivering
    via multicast (FIX protocol extension). It is used to support high-throughput,
    low latency data communications between financial institutions. It&#39;s worth
    reading this short document: http://www.fixtradingcommunity.org/pg/file/fplpo/read/30528/multicast-recommended-practices<br
    /><br />The protocol implements simple mechanisms to handle duplicate data, out-of-order
    and lost segments.<br /><br />- '

  html: Linux sets DF on all outbound traffic (including multicast) by default unless
    the application specifies otherwise. I think this is a flaw, given that PMTUD
    is impossible for IPv4 multicast.<br /><br />Personally, I think that v4 got it
    wrong, and v6 got it right. PMTUD for multicast should be possible.<br /><br />The
    concerns about too many unreachables (including when elicited by packets from
    spoofed sources) don&#39;t really resonate with me compared to the ugliness of
    needlessly fragmenting traffic. At the very least, this behavior should be configurable
    so that it can be used where appropriate.

  html: I usually hear it referred to as &quot;WAD&quot;, working as designed.
