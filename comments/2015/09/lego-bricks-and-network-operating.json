          "html": "The big difference between Linux on a server and Linux on a switch is that on a switch Linux is just part of the control plane. The actual data plane is an ASIC (whether that&#39;s custom or OTS like a Broadcom or Intel/Fulcrum).  So &quot;rebooting&quot; Linux is a non-issue for data flow, assuming it&#39;s necessary at all (in most cases packages can be upgraded and restarted without a restart).  And even if the Linux kernel *was* part of the data plane somehow (pure softswitch/router/etc.), there are multiple methods of patching it without a reboot.  So Ivan&#39;s point stands, and stands well IMHO.  I&#39;d absolutely love the ability to only load the packages necessary for the functionality I use, and to be able to upgrade them without having to restart my switches.",

While on routers, everything is performance-sensitive. (Either raw pps, or scalability of the control plane). Everything that is raw pps performance related in Linux is hidden in the kernel. In other words: you&#39;d have to upgrade the whole kernel to fix a bug in Linux. And reboot the box. Not much different.<br /><br />If you release your software as hundreds or thousands of tiny lego bricks, you will run into another problem. Interoperability. Not all lego blocks will be compatible. You&#39;ll need to keep track of what works with what. And developers have to keep it in mind too, and document it, and hope they tested all combinations that a customer could up with.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as simple as you describe here.<br /><br />Of course I do agree what having different components running as different processes, e.g. like in a Unix environment is to be preferred over a monolitic one-memory-space one-image-blob architecture.

      "html": "The truth is always in between :-)<br /><br />Most Linux distributions are using different releases to separate maintenance and important bugfixes from new features. When an issue is discovered in some software and the upstream developer releases a new software version (including bug fixes and new features), the Linux distro folks do hunt for the actual bugfix and apply this bugfix to the software version which has been released for the Linux distribution (e.g. Debian 7.x = Wheezy).<br /><br />The upstream newer software releases are packaged and compiled for a future major release of the Linux distribution (e.g. Debian 8.x = Squeeze). Once the new major release has been released, the &quot;old&quot; stable release will be supported for some time (e.g. 18 months) with security fixes only. With &quot;enterprise&quot; distributions, you&#39;ll typically get support for a few years into the future, but the story stays the same: the release of a new major (with new bugs and features!) still requires you to upgrade your systems to this new major release, if you&#39;d like to continue having security fixes.<br /><br />Technically, one can upgrade their entire system &quot;by package&quot;. However, some packages may no longer be supported in the new major release, but they&#39;re also not uninstalled from your box. So when you&#39;re installing a new system next to your upgraded system, it might look, act and feel different, due to slightly different installed packages. If you&#39;re asked to rebuild this system, you simply can&#39;t take the latest major release: some software will be missing or probably change the overall behaviour.<br /><br />Hence many experienced Linux system administrators do take the &quot;major release&quot; cycle as a chance to re-build their systems from scratch. Some approaches in systems administration apply the same logic for every application release: every time one is deploying a new software release, new VMs/containers will be freshly installed according to some Puppet manifest, Chef recipe or Ansible Playbook, the systems are introduced into the running application cluster and older systems are removed.<br /><br />Typical networking vendors can also apply the same logic for the BFI approach: a &quot;stable&quot; branch won&#39;t receive new features for a long time, but only bugfixes. New features are added to a &quot;fresh&quot; branch. Every other year, &quot;fresh&quot; becomes the next &quot;stable&quot;. The &quot;old stable&quot; release continues to receive bugfixes for a year, but that&#39;s it: users are asked to upgrade to the &quot;new stable&quot;.<br /><br />Of course: the developers or BFI builders need to apply the same bugfix both in the current release and an older release. For some time, the actual difference is very small and easy, but after about 2-3 years, the differences may become large - but luckily, that&#39;s just the point where a new major release will be created. Some vendors may not have notices this point :)<br /><br />So by installing a stable BFI with the same major version following the scenario above, you&#39;d only install the list of vendor-supplied bugfixes in a reproducible way. Individually composing your system of thousands of different packages looks like a nightmare for traditional vendors: it might be very hard for them to reproduce and fix your bug report.",
