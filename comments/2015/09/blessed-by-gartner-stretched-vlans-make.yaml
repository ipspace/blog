    html: Don&#39;t think so. Must be something else. What &quot;other geographies&quot;
      are you referring to?

    html: Hi Ivan, The &quot;other geographies&quot; are North America and APAC. It
      is probably coincidence that I see this more often from our European clients
      :)

  html: Andrew has written an excellent report. <br /><br />I keep coming across L2
    extension requirements quite often. In addition to reasoning with the folks who
    want to do this, I keep referring folks to your numerous posts on this subject.
    Now I am beginning to refer to Andrew&#39;s report as well :) <br /><br />In my
    experience, I see stretched VLAN requirements coming mostly from our European
    clients who want to build active/active DCs within a metro area. I see this less
    from clients in other geographies. Could it be the availability of cheaper dark
    fiber / DWDM links within metro areas in Europe? <br />

  html: Thank you for this. Like many we&#39;ve been saying the same for years but
    the only way to even bring up not building L2 stretch further is the &quot;Gartner
    said so&quot; we have been so desperately waiting for!
