            <div class="comment-content">Valid points. But unfortunately SDN apart from providing a programmatic interface is in same mess. Controller REST APIs vary wildly . Even Openflow switches vary in what they support.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">So industry-standards in that area would be RFC6241 for deployment engine and RFC6020 for modeling.<br />Another (big possibly) attempt in that area is gRPC support on network devices...<br /><br />Network community is going to the same evolution that happened to System Engineers 5-6 years ago with configuration management FOSS tools getting popular. In that world engineer no longer sees single box as something he needs to configure, but works manifests/playbooks/cookbooks -- text files, describing desired state and variables of abstract service.<br /><br />Yet, even assuming all that is given, how many network engineers are ready to manage network via definitions files, code reviews and automated deployment?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">or, you can take part in a community-developed network devices syntax parser like this one https://github.com/networktocode/ntc-ansible<br />which largely is still screen scraping but a lot more manageable and robust</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hah, screen scraping is the worst. Unfortunately, like everyone said, it will be a long time before we can rid all networks of these devices and they will haunt and paralyze the network for years to come. Yes, REST/SOAP APIs will change and vary wildly but they are orders of magnitude more sustainable than parsing / regexing / expecting through console output for every vendors whim. Until then, the network will be the brunt of developers and CIOs. If you have to run a network/infrastructure and you can standardize on one vendor/API for the entire network, you&#39;re golden. However, modern stacks are usually too varied and complex to lend themselves to that. Like everyone has said, waiting for the network world to standardize on models/APIs is always painful. Just as always, those who can execute and be on top of maintaining drivers for each of their select vendors wins (think SOA and swapping out drivers). Software engineers are used to ever changing APIs and obviously not as paralyzed as the network world. Your cloud service providers have simply excelled in stringing together many of the same pieces and wrapping it up in a bow. Many vendors have had SOAP/REST APIs for automation for a long time so the most interesting forces of SDN have been introducing software discipline/benefits like versioned lifecycle (infrastructure as code) and self-service. If we are to then treat networks/infrastructure like a software system, it should be well architected, enable self-service, resilient and autonomous (i.e. closed loop,anomaly/exception handling and not needing a lot of interaction/orchestration). Heck, even GIT + REST + well architected systems (works for software) could go a long way for heterogenous networks/infrastructure in the mean time. As stacks collapse and tenancy also involves network/infrastructure changes (ex. new client = new VPC/VXLAN/etc), there will be less static infrastructure to maintain anyway and network/infrastructure vendor CLIs will most likely be a distant memory. Then controllers in charge of the full tenant topologies will eventually be judged on how many API drivers they integrate with and support (to maintain not just the software defined tenant/application topologies but the supporting static infrastructure).  <br /><br /> </div>
