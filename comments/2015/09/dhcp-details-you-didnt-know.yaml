    html: If the question is &quot;I cannot define two entries with the same IP address,
      is there a way to do it&quot;, the answer is &quot;no idea&quot; :(

  html: 'First - thanks for your network work for all that time.<br /><br />Let me
    ask again about DHCP with static binding on IOS router.<br />I have origin file
    for the dhcp pool and I badly want to have same static IP addresses for every
    host no matter what we boot: windows, linux or PXE. Do You have any solution for
    this? How to force an IOS to treat hw address as client-id when no client-id is
    passed by the requesting machine?'
