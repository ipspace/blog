      "html": "Andrew has written an excellent report. <br /><br />I keep coming across L2 extension requirements quite often. In addition to reasoning with the folks who want to do this, I keep referring folks to your numerous posts on this subject. Now I am beginning to refer to Andrew&#39;s report as well :) <br /><br />In my experience, I see stretched VLAN requirements coming mostly from our European clients who want to build active/active DCs within a metro area. I see this less from clients in other geographies. Could it be the availability of cheaper dark fiber / DWDM links within metro areas in Europe? <br />",
