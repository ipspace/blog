Cisco Nexus 7000 supports EVPN (http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/nx-os/vxlan/configuration/guide/b_NX-OS_VXLAN_Configuration_Guide/configuring_vxlan_bgp_evpn.html)<br /><br />2. HP supports multicast flooding for VXLAN, it&#39;s available in the 5930 VXLAN Configuration guide (haven&#39;t checked the 7900/12900).<br /><br />3. HP also supports a VXLAN control plane, but it is proprietary based on IS-IS rather than EVPN (available on 12900). EVPN support is coming CY2016 from what I have been told.",

ALU (Nokia) got the service provider stuff and ALE got the campus LAN/Wifi and DC stuff (OmniX). I&#39;d expect a rebrand soon since they split nearly 12 months ago.<br /><br />ALE&#39;s OmniSwitch manuals are online. Make sure you hit enterprise.alcatel-lucent.com before trying to get to support. I believe only the OS6900-Q32,X72 support VXLAN termination. The -X20,X40,T20,T40 don&#39;t and never will (earlier generation Trident II). Quick skim -- seems to support unicast and multicast VXLAN.<br /><br />About 6 months ago Avaya&#39;s VSP platform documentation was available, but their site was/is frustratingly hard to navigate. I just gave it a 10 minute try and gave up. IIRC, the VSP 7200 &amp; 8400 support VXLAN, but it&#39;s very early implementation.<br /><br />Both Avaya and ALE&#39;s switches are Broadcom based, which means they both suffer from the problem of not having the right forwarding pipeline stage ordering/count to put a router interface inside a VXLAN VTEP or inside an SPB I-SID. Avaya solves it with some loopback traces on the board (good luck figuring out specs). ALE solves it by saying &quot;use a loopback cable in a link-agg configuration&quot;.<br /><br />The VXLAN Routing &quot;yes&quot; for HP gives me pause. I believe a lot of HP&#39;s 1U/2U lineup is Trident II based. While ComWare may support the construct, the hardware might not.",
