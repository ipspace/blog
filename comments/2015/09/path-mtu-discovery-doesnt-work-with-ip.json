      "html": "Linux sets DF on all outbound traffic (including multicast) by default unless the application specifies otherwise. I think this is a flaw, given that PMTUD is impossible for IPv4 multicast.<br /><br />Personally, I think that v4 got it wrong, and v6 got it right. PMTUD for multicast should be possible.<br /><br />The concerns about too many unreachables (including when elicited by packets from spoofed sources) don&#39;t really resonate with me compared to the ugliness of needlessly fragmenting traffic. At the very least, this behavior should be configurable so that it can be used where appropriate.",
