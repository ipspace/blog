  html: Valid points. But unfortunately SDN apart from providing a programmatic interface
    is in same mess. Controller REST APIs vary wildly . Even Openflow switches vary
    in what they support.

  html: So industry-standards in that area would be RFC6241 for deployment engine
    and RFC6020 for modeling.<br />Another (big possibly) attempt in that area is
    gRPC support on network devices...<br /><br />Network community is going to the
    same evolution that happened to System Engineers 5-6 years ago with configuration
    management FOSS tools getting popular. In that world engineer no longer sees single
    box as something he needs to configure, but works manifests/playbooks/cookbooks
    -- text files, describing desired state and variables of abstract service.<br
    /><br />Yet, even assuming all that is given, how many network engineers are ready
    to manage network via definitions files, code reviews and automated deployment?

  html: I&#39;ve seen hundreds of projects where router configuration files were listed
    in terms of +/- changes to be done during the window.  Network Engineers are ready,
    just need to migrate towards a new methodology mindset.

  html: or, you can take part in a community-developed network devices syntax parser
    like this one https://github.com/networktocode/ntc-ansible<br />which largely
    is still screen scraping but a lot more manageable and robust

  html: 'Hah, screen scraping is the worst. Unfortunately, like everyone said, it
    will be a long time before we can rid all networks of these devices and they will
    haunt and paralyze the network for years to come. Yes, REST/SOAP APIs will change
    and vary wildly but they are orders of magnitude more sustainable than parsing
    / regexing / expecting through console output for every vendors whim. Until then,
    the network will be the brunt of developers and CIOs. If you have to run a network/infrastructure
    and you can standardize on one vendor/API for the entire network, you&#39;re golden.
    However, modern stacks are usually too varied and complex to lend themselves to
    that. Like everyone has said, waiting for the network world to standardize on
    models/APIs is always painful. Just as always, those who can execute and be on
    top of maintaining drivers for each of their select vendors wins (think SOA and
    swapping out drivers). Software engineers are used to ever changing APIs and obviously
    not as paralyzed as the network world. Your cloud service providers have simply
    excelled in stringing together many of the same pieces and wrapping it up in a
    bow. Many vendors have had SOAP/REST APIs for automation for a long time so the
    most interesting forces of SDN have been introducing software discipline/benefits
    like versioned lifecycle (infrastructure as code) and self-service. If we are
    to then treat networks/infrastructure like a software system, it should be well
    architected, enable self-service, resilient and autonomous (i.e. closed loop,anomaly/exception
    handling and not needing a lot of interaction/orchestration). Heck, even GIT +
    REST + well architected systems (works for software) could go a long way for heterogenous
    networks/infrastructure in the mean time. As stacks collapse and tenancy also
    involves network/infrastructure changes (ex. new client = new VPC/VXLAN/etc),
    there will be less static infrastructure to maintain anyway and network/infrastructure
    vendor CLIs will most likely be a distant memory. Then controllers in charge of
    the full tenant topologies will eventually be judged on how many API drivers they
    integrate with and support (to maintain not just the software defined tenant/application
    topologies but the supporting static infrastructure).  <br /><br /> '
