    html: '&quot;Ansible works so much better with Junos than with Cisco via NAPALM&quot;
      &lt;&lt; Yeah, I keep telling people what they should consider when buying new
      gear, but it&#39;s as successful as fighting windmills with RITA (see RFC 2321).<br

  html: You&#39;re bang on the money here Ivan. Declarative &gt; imperative. Idempotency.<br
    /><br />This is why in my experience Ansible works so much better with Junos than
    with Cisco via NAPALM. Idempotency and atomic commits built in.

    html: REST is just a pretty inconvenient transport mechanism (because it maintains
      no state across calls). <br /><br />The real question is whether you deal with
      the whole data model at once (which we seem to agree on) or whether you have
      to carefully move around like ninja in a dark room full of tripwires.<br /><br
      />As for Cisco IOS, &quot;configure replace&quot; is a far cry from what Junos
      or Arista have, but it&#39;s continuously getting better... not that I would
      use it for a new IOS feature without testing it first.

  html: I think people want to use rest so that there is an ability to maintain consistency
    of configuration. Cisco IOS CLI doesnt lend itself to consistency i.e what you
    push is what you get if you implement diff logic for replacing config. The idea
    is not REST it is about well defined models which allow idempotency in network
    operations

  html: 'I work in the Internet of Things space more than Network Automation, but
    it strikes me that there are a lot of parallels.<br />NETCONF/YANG is widely acknowledged
    as a powerful tool. For example, the IETF &quot;YANG of Things&quot; working group
    would like to see YANG used all the way from SDN down to IoT edge devices.<br
    />But yet, the industry lags behind. The oneM2M &quot;standard&quot; gives 3 options
    for Device Management: TR-069 (BroadBand Forum), OMA-DM (Open Mobile Alliance),
    and LWM2M (Open Mobile Alliance). All use HTTP-based protocols and CRUD data models.<br
    />Sigh.'
