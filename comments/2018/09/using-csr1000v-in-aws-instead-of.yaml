    html: Think about how packet forwarding works in overlay virtual networks, and
      you&#39;ll soon figure out why transit VPC is such a Mission Impossible.<br
      /><br />AWS is really good at not giving in to features that would endanger
      their scalability and stability (layer-2 stuff and IP MC come to mind).

    html: I had a similar situation a few years ago for a large client moving their
      apps into AWS and Azure. Turned into an absolute pain to manage as neither the
      MSP or client saw the value in automation. On the bright side, we were able
      to set up a transit VNet within Azure.<br /><br />They required IPsec to terminate
      within the VPC/VNets but also didn&#39;t allow public IP addressing into their
      MPLS VPN due to FUD (these were directconnect &amp; expressroute), so native
      cloud IPSec (VPGs etc) couldn&#39;t be used. Client was Cisco based so deployed
      CSR1000Vs on the cloud providers into the DMVPN on the WAN. <br /><br />Then
      the client wanted to use more than one VPC/VNet and didn&#39;t want to set up
      N number of peering links between VPCs (again, didn&#39;t like automation) or
      separate CSRs with the security licence and big instances to do IPSec. So we
      ended up getting sign off on a transit VPC and running a second tier DMVPN network
      inside AWS without tunnel protection profiles. <br /><br />This is really just
      a story of bringing old culture into the new world. Want a VPC? Sorry, that&#39;ll
      be a new PO to the MSP to create the CSRs with an 8 week lead time, plus 2 weeks
      design review and 2 week change management lead time.<br /><br />

  html: Transit VPC is a challenge for anyone trying to design a hub-and-spoke topology
    in AWS. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see AWS release a new type of VPC specifically
    for this purpose..

    html: You don&#39;t need a knife to cut that cheese - we had chainsaws for the
      last 100 years. Yep, makes perfect sense.

  html: So with your Ansible playbook, you actually invented something called routing
    protocol. Why do you reinvent the wheel? We have BGP for over 20 years.

  html: Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure they&#39;re working on some kind of APIC to
    control VPCs (which will cost even more than 1000Vs but will be justified by providing
    higher throughput). :-/

  html: Amazon has just announced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-use-an-aws-transit-gateway-to-simplify-your-network-architecture/"
    rel="nofollow">Transit Gateway</a> that makes this transit VPC + CSR1kv combo
    unnecessary for most of the cases.

  html: 'No need for anything Cisco in the cloud. Use something like Aviatrix to orchestrate,
    automate and monitor your transit and spoke VPCs. Use Trend Micro to secure your
    instances. Cisco is far behind in cloud technology. '
