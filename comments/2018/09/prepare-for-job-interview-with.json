What I really like about your content, Ivan, is that you present your information with a &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; approach. The content you provide also illustrates technical break-downs and sometimes challenges vendor solutions - bypassing the marketing/sales cycle hype. I always look forward to reading/listening to your blogs and webinars - other computer based training materials don&#39;t really provide this level of vendor neutral material based on years of networking experiences from the trenches.",
