      "html": "Interesting as always, Ivan. Unfortunately we would get stuck at the very first step. Who is a Tier 1 provider? How do you define that? And even if you could, ISPs want to be Tier 1 because of marketing. And they wouldn&#39;t let you view their details of peerings, contracts etc...<br /><br />So... What we are left with is probably automatic filtering based on what is in route databases BUT:<br /><br />ISPs are lazy<br />They care about moving packets not suboptimal routing or security<br />Route databases often aren&#39;t fully accurate<br />Not all ISPs have automated their filters<br /><br />So the unfortunate outcome is that we&#39;ll see route leaks even in the future. Our hope relies upon people like Job Snijders who are passionate about building a better internet.",

      "html": "But now, first, Ivan, pray tell, in RIFT we don&#39;t build &quot;plug-and-pray&quot; fabric, we build a &quot;plug-and-forget&quot; ZTP fabric  ;-) <br /><br />Valley free routing (which I call more generically no-zigzag routing, you can easily figure out what I mean, you go north until you change direction and go south which you do with the 0 and +/-, unsurprisingly major principle in RIFT again ;-) is a very desirable, very hard to achieve property unless you have a sense of N-S on the substrate (fabric, AS-mesh, whatever) which preconditions sense of direction (to be bit bloated, you need a partial mesh with a max-upper and lower bound). And hence, if done extremely well you are not even bound by ECMP anymore ;-) <br /><br />I do obviously think for locally provisioned bandwith (such as IP fabrics) this is a natural way to progress and will become stronger with the demise of &quot;artisanal local network configuration skills&quot;. Whether it will be Clos or some variant thereof is not very interesting, routing will adjust, the more &quot;interconnected&quot; your fabric in terms of shortcut the more routing information you&#39;ll have to slosh around @ convergence cost @ failure and so on. For things like WAN &amp; AS meshes this is much, much harder thing to achieve, see also the &quot;peer complex role&quot; route leaking discussions in GROW. Hence I don&#39;t think lots of progress will be made unless some kind of economic cost will be imposed on hot potato routing ;-) <br /><br />Good article ... ",
