            <div class="comment-content">Is interesting to read that everything is not new to you. Maybe you&#39;re a traveller from the future. I think you don&#39;t know the difference between a declarative and imperative approach. It&#39;s hard to do a declarative approach with Ansible and the nice network vendor APIs. IaC applies more to cloud infrastructure (public and OpenStack) where the network plays a very small role. There&#39;s a good book (Terraform...) out there that gives you a good introduction to the topic.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Maybe I shouldn&#39;t be doing this (you know, don&#39;t feed...) but here it is:<br /><br />&quot;Is interesting to read that everything is not new to you. Maybe you&#39;re a traveller from the future.&quot; &lt;&lt; or maybe I&#39;ve been in this industry long enough to seen every hype once or twice. I understand that things don&#39;t look that way to you, and I have no problem with that.<br /><br />&quot;I think you don&#39;t know the difference between a declarative and imperative approach.&quot; &lt;&lt; so please tell me where I went astray... after reading https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/06/what-is-intent-based-networking.html. I did a deeper dive in a webinar, but that would require actually investing something into this topic. I don&#39;t expect that.<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s hard to do a declarative approach with Ansible and the nice network vendor APIs.&quot; &lt;&lt; hehe, you guessed the topic of the next blog post :D You probably also missed https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/04/dont-get-obsessed-with-rest-api.html<br /><br />&quot;IaC applies more to cloud infrastructure (public and OpenStack) where the network plays a very small role.&quot; &lt;&lt; I have no problem with that, but as soon as someone starts talking about &quot;network infrastructure as a code&quot; it&#39;s time for me to call bullshit.<br /><br />&quot;There&#39;s a good book (Terraform...) out there that gives you a good introduction to the topic.&quot; &lt;&lt; I know you wouldn&#39;t believe it, but I actually read what some people believe to be THE book on the topic. http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920039297.do ... and found that it nicely confirms my views.</div>

I thought of the book called &quot;Terraform up and running&quot; not the one you mentioned. The book is very condensed and clear. I respect your other statements and let it uncommented.

            <div class="comment-content">agree with the previous commenter. also wikipedia is not a good place to learn about new tech. books are good but even a brief read of Terraform, Cloudformation or Heat guides will give you a much better understanding than what you get from wiki.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I would never dream about using Wikipedia to learn about new tech. It&#39;s supposed to be encyclopedia, not training course, or vendor/product tech site.<br /><br />However, sometimes it helps to have a crisp definition of a misused term, and in the world dominated by vendor marketing, it&#39;s great to have a platform that enables anyone to chime in, and exposes all the ****fight in plain view.</div>
