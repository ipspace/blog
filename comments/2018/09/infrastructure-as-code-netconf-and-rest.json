      "html": "I think people want to use rest so that there is an ability to maintain consistency of configuration. Cisco IOS CLI doesnt lend itself to consistency i.e what you push is what you get if you implement diff logic for replacing config. The idea is not REST it is about well defined models which allow idempotency in network operations",

For example, the IETF &quot;YANG of Things&quot; working group would like to see YANG used all the way from SDN down to IoT edge devices.<br />But yet, the industry lags behind. The oneM2M &quot;standard&quot; gives 3 options for Device Management: TR-069 (BroadBand Forum), OMA-DM (Open Mobile Alliance), and LWM2M (Open Mobile Alliance). All use HTTP-based protocols and CRUD data models.<br />Sigh.",
