I write &quot;smart NIC&quot; in quotes because in the case of AWS, I think it is actually an ASIC developed in-house by AWS based on their Annapurna acquisition which does not just networking but also compute and storage.",

      "html": "Using your favorite phrase - \u201cit depends\u201d :)<br />1. +1 to Bruno\u2019s comment on Nitro, if you provide IaaS, any cycle spent on infra is taken off the total sellable capacity pool. AWS has done a great job to make the difference in performance between baremetal and their infra pretty much negligible while keeping workloads decoupled from the infra, all thanks to Annapurna HW.<br /><br />2. Specifically talking about smart NICs, i really enjoyed working with Netronome NICs, crafting pretty futuristic stuff within hours, well designed HW accompanied by well described APIs makes them IMO very distinct in this segment.<br />3. There\u2019s number of companies providing P4 front-ends to FPGA\u2019s, which allows to define processing behavior without going into low level programming, space to watch for.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Jeff",
