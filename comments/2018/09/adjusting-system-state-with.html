            <div class="comment-content">Your assumption (&quot;implements configuration replacement at some reasonably good-enough level&quot;) in God&#39;s ear. In the end effect it&#39;s just a replace exercise on the device/orchestration system and it doesn&#39;t matter which interface (REST, NETCONF, SSH etc.) someone use. All that matters is quality of the replace function. A &quot;delete and create new&quot; approach I see problematic in the networking field.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">In the 3 steps approach there should be the 4th: in case you cannot workarround the issue ask the vendor for fixes &amp; pray for a fix (most likely you&#39;ll learn that it&#39;s WAD (works as designed although undocumented).<br /><br />Have 25+ years of experience in the networking field and I spent 10+ years automating systems where hundreds of networking devices are used. Our system have pre-defined number of options (but many combinations are possible). Adjusting system state even following/selecting pre-defined (certified system state) is challenging. I cannot imagine that someone can simply &#39;adjust&#39; state without testing it upfront (as we do) to increase the likehood of success. <br /><br />I am not talking about trivial changes like add new vlan &amp; static routing. Talking about mission critical voice &amp; data network (vpn, qos, HA, subsecond-failover, etc)<br /><br />Regardless of the vendor you select there are so many bugs in the software so this reason the ideal 3 step approach must fail.<br />It would work if the &#39;lego&#39; blocks provided by vendors were well tested &amp; documented (no research to understand the function) and have no hidden dependencies between features.<br />Otherwise you need to test &amp; certify all &#39;adjustments&#39;, particularly where timing is important (fast failure &amp; recovery<br />Maybe I live in different world but working for one of the major system vendor and using top brand networking devices.<br /><br /></div>
