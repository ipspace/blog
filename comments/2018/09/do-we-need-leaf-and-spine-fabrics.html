            <div class="comment-content">You&#39;ve really hit the nail on the head here Ivan (as usual :-).<br /><br />For me the main point is to kill the old &quot;everything 2N redundant&quot; model with fire.<br />N+1 is the only way to scale economically.<br /><br />N+1 bandwidth &amp; N+1 redundancy (&amp; N must be &gt;=2) are really nice (&amp; IMHO operationally necessary) but economics are the driver that will get management to sign off on it.<br /><br />Especially when you&#39;re replacing 2N big expensive $VENDOR chassis with N+1 1u merchant silicon boxes.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">At least I find that a routed spine-and-leaf network is also easier to understand and debug than the &quot;traditional&quot; three-layer core-aggregation-access design with Spanning Tree and VLANs going all over the place.  A symmetric and regular design is good.  The pain when you have forgotten to add a VLAN to the backup link (normally blocked by STP), and don&#39;t notice until the primary breaks is not.  Or when you have bit errors on the backup link, which are not noticable until you put significant traffic on it, and get 3Â Kbyte/s throughput on your TCP streams...<br /><br />Just being able to traceroute and see exactly which way packets take are quite helpful in finding where things break.  (That assumes you are not doing tunneling/overlays, though.)<br /><br />My experience is also that at least OSPF converges much faster after a failure than STP (even Rapid STP) after the STP root fails.<br /><br />There is often more configuration (as in lines in the switch configs) in a routed network than in a bridged network, though, especially when you add a bunch of VRFs to separate various management networks.  But unnumbered links makes things easier (allocating all those /31:s and /127:s and making sure you get the right address at the right end can be a large part of the work of adding a VRF).  And if you subscribe to the automation mantra, that takes out a large part of the rest. :-)<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">No complex leaf and spine design needed because most companies still using mainframes. So 2 switches and 2 routers are enough for them.</div>
