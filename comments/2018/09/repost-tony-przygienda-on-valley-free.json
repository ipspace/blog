      "html": "Given you liked the quick jolt, here&#39;s a bit of deeper thoughts ;-) Ivan while I have my first coffee of the morning. Valley-Free routing is one approach how to deal with the inefficiencies of zig-zag routing (your post actually has a zig-zag in it ;-) or what most people call in fact valley-free routing. And to be fair, there were other ideas by very smart people like landmark routing that avoided the &quot;shortest X&quot; type approach to routing as in shortest-as-path, shortest-distance and so on. They died on the vines. <br /><br />At the danger of repeating myself, IMO a very simple approach to achieve VFR is to force direction on the graph so you know when you go up or down, everything else leads normally to a &quot;strange attractor&quot; architecture where &quot;beacons&quot; try to pull traffic towards them and it&#39;s easy to end in chaos (some people will get my &quot;strange attractors&quot; pun and that&#39;s where all the &quot;complex role&quot; and &quot;multihomed prefix leaking&quot; will end up with, they are creating the three-body problem again ;-) And once you have an up/down you realize that you are dealing with &quot;partial orders&quot; and resulting maximum and minimum bounds which allows you to do a lot of clean thinking what/how things are possible on such structures. Horizontal links are detrimental in terms of routing complexity in such architectures (except for protection purposes) BTW for reasons I don&#39;t dwelve further in but if you are familiar with the problem of having to install discards for your summaries ;-) to prevent loops horizontal links lead to same flavor of problems. <br /><br />Another very extreme approach that can work is to have &quot;all directions&quot; being equal and try to operate a folded mesh, hypercube or dragonfly but that forces on you all links being equally long and equal bandwidth (and normally longer #hops paths with lower minimal cut properties). The advantage is that if you really build a full hypercube you don&#39;t need routing anymore, addresses are routes (problem of link breakage on such structure would lead us a deeper discussion about crank-backs and so on so I drop it).  NUMA has exploited that kind of structures and it was/is viable for them but it looks hard to me in networks where we tend to &quot;aggregate bandwidth up&quot; and connectivity is far more expensive and less even due to physical spaces we span. And every forwarding hop is quite expensive on top delay-wise. <br /><br />If that all reads like Greek to non-Greeks ;-) I observe that all those terms are easily accessible on Wikipedia and well-understood in graph theory and slightly advanced (linear) algebra. And for people I din&#39;t meet as side-note: I&#39;m not a mathematician ;-) I write lots of code and I talk to people fighting the daily battle in the mud a lot for quite some time now and based on scar tissue and interest I got myself enough mathematical background to possibly see larger patterns that repeat ;-) And if the complexity of this bit is already overwhelming, let&#39;s mention that details of implementation of those things @ scale are unfortunately so voluminous and hideously complicated that they would be impossible to talk about in simple blog posts ;-)<br />",
