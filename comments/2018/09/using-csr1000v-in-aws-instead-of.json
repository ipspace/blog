          "html": "I had a similar situation a few years ago for a large client moving their apps into AWS and Azure. Turned into an absolute pain to manage as neither the MSP or client saw the value in automation. On the bright side, we were able to set up a transit VNet within Azure.<br /><br />They required IPsec to terminate within the VPC/VNets but also didn&#39;t allow public IP addressing into their MPLS VPN due to FUD (these were directconnect &amp; expressroute), so native cloud IPSec (VPGs etc) couldn&#39;t be used. Client was Cisco based so deployed CSR1000Vs on the cloud providers into the DMVPN on the WAN. <br /><br />Then the client wanted to use more than one VPC/VNet and didn&#39;t want to set up N number of peering links between VPCs (again, didn&#39;t like automation) or separate CSRs with the security licence and big instances to do IPSec. So we ended up getting sign off on a transit VPC and running a second tier DMVPN network inside AWS without tunnel protection profiles. <br /><br />This is really just a story of bringing old culture into the new world. Want a VPC? Sorry, that&#39;ll be a new PO to the MSP to create the CSRs with an 8 week lead time, plus 2 weeks design review and 2 week change management lead time.<br /><br />",
