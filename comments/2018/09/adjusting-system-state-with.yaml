    html: We keep going around in circles (spirals) anyway but that&#39;s a different
      story. Let&#39;s go back to the topic which you wrote out quite well.

  html: If it would be that easy (your last three advices), we wouldn&#39;t know what
    to do with that much free time.

    html: '&quot;All that matters is quality of the replace function.&quot; &lt;&lt;
      I wrote this:<br /><br />https://blog.ipspace.net/2016/10/network-automation-rfp-requirements.html<br
      /><br />to make people aware of what they might need. I don&#39;t think it saw
      much use... the root cause is probably that people buying the gear rarely have
      to make it work. I wonder if they buy their cars the same way ;)'

  html: Your assumption (&quot;implements configuration replacement at some reasonably
    good-enough level&quot;) in God&#39;s ear. In the end effect it&#39;s just a replace
    exercise on the device/orchestration system and it doesn&#39;t matter which interface
    (REST, NETCONF, SSH etc.) someone use. All that matters is quality of the replace
    function. A &quot;delete and create new&quot; approach I see problematic in the
    networking field.

  html: 'In the 3 steps approach there should be the 4th: in case you cannot workarround
    the issue ask the vendor for fixes &amp; pray for a fix (most likely you&#39;ll
    learn that it&#39;s WAD (works as designed although undocumented).<br /><br />Have
    25+ years of experience in the networking field and I spent 10+ years automating
    systems where hundreds of networking devices are used. Our system have pre-defined
    number of options (but many combinations are possible). Adjusting system state
    even following/selecting pre-defined (certified system state) is challenging.
    I cannot imagine that someone can simply &#39;adjust&#39; state without testing
    it upfront (as we do) to increase the likehood of success. <br /><br />I am not
    talking about trivial changes like add new vlan &amp; static routing. Talking
    about mission critical voice &amp; data network (vpn, qos, HA, subsecond-failover,
    etc)<br /><br />Regardless of the vendor you select there are so many bugs in
    the software so this reason the ideal 3 step approach must fail.<br />It would
    work if the &#39;lego&#39; blocks provided by vendors were well tested &amp; documented
    (no research to understand the function) and have no hidden dependencies between
    features.<br />Otherwise you need to test &amp; certify all &#39;adjustments&#39;,
    particularly where timing is important (fast failure &amp; recovery<br />Maybe
    I live in different world but working for one of the major system vendor and using
    top brand networking devices.<br /><br />'
