    html: '&quot;you don&#39;t know the difference between a declarative and imperative
      approach&quot;<br /><br />Could you please describe the difference between the
      &#39;declarative&#39; and &#39;imperative&#39; approach which is (by your opinion)
      not understood by Ivan.<br />Thanks,'

    html: Maybe I shouldn&#39;t be doing this (you know, don&#39;t feed...) but here
      it is:<br /><br />&quot;Is interesting to read that everything is not new to
      you. Maybe you&#39;re a traveller from the future.&quot; &lt;&lt; or maybe I&#39;ve
      been in this industry long enough to seen every hype once or twice. I understand
      that things don&#39;t look that way to you, and I have no problem with that.<br
      /><br />&quot;I think you don&#39;t know the difference between a declarative
      and imperative approach.&quot; &lt;&lt; so please tell me where I went astray...
      after reading https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/06/what-is-intent-based-networking.html.
      I did a deeper dive in a webinar, but that would require actually investing
      something into this topic. I don&#39;t expect that.<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s
      hard to do a declarative approach with Ansible and the nice network vendor APIs.&quot;
      &lt;&lt; hehe, you guessed the topic of the next blog post :D You probably also
      missed https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/04/dont-get-obsessed-with-rest-api.html<br
      /><br />&quot;IaC applies more to cloud infrastructure (public and OpenStack)
      where the network plays a very small role.&quot; &lt;&lt; I have no problem
      with that, but as soon as someone starts talking about &quot;network infrastructure
      as a code&quot; it&#39;s time for me to call bullshit.<br /><br />&quot;There&#39;s
      a good book (Terraform...) out there that gives you a good introduction to the
      topic.&quot; &lt;&lt; I know you wouldn&#39;t believe it, but I actually read
      what some people believe to be THE book on the topic. http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920039297.do
      ... and found that it nicely confirms my views.

    html: I&#39;ve read both of your blog posts and I&#39;ve even commented on it.
      I thought of the book called &quot;Terraform up and running&quot; not the one
      you mentioned. The book is very condensed and clear. I respect your other statements
      and let it uncommented. The troll is saturated.

    html: I thought about mentioning Wikipedia as a source of knowledge but I didn&#39;t
      want to be too critical. But I agree with you on the quality of Wikipedia.

    html: I would never dream about using Wikipedia to learn about new tech. It&#39;s
      supposed to be encyclopedia, not training course, or vendor/product tech site.<br
      /><br />However, sometimes it helps to have a crisp definition of a misused
      term, and in the world dominated by vendor marketing, it&#39;s great to have
      a platform that enables anyone to chime in, and exposes all the ****fight in
      plain view.

  html: agree with the previous commenter. also wikipedia is not a good place to learn
    about new tech. books are good but even a brief read of Terraform, Cloudformation
    or Heat guides will give you a much better understanding than what you get from
    wiki.

  html: Wow time warp! I use to build 3705 NCP in another life - had to use low priority
    off peak batch queues. If you were very careful to make no mistakes you could
    be ready to raise the ChgCtrl with 2-3 days. Thought I&#39;d forgotten about all
    that
