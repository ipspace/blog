    html: Yeah, it&#39;s so nice to see ksoftirqd eating up core 0 while all the other
      cores are idle...

  html: So one CPU per port? Well we had that 40 years ago. What about 100 Gbit/s
    or even 1 Tbit/s, is it possible?

    html: 'AWS has a specific challenge: implement network virtualization for bare-metal
      workloads without touching the ToR switch (ACI style) because that doesn&#39;t
      scale. An extra ASIC in the forwarding path is the only way to do that.'

  html: I wouldn&#39;t write smart NICs off completely quite so easily.  For example,
    doesn&#39;t AWS use &quot;smart NICs&quot; in their new Nitro architecture?  I
    write &quot;smart NIC&quot; in quotes because in the case of AWS, I think it is
    actually an ASIC developed in-house by AWS based on their Annapurna acquisition
    which does not just networking but also compute and storage.

  html: "Using your favorite phrase - \u201Cit depends\u201D :)<br />1. +1 to Bruno\u2019\
    s comment on Nitro, if you provide IaaS, any cycle spent on infra is taken off\
    \ the total sellable capacity pool. AWS has done a great job to make the difference\
    \ in performance between baremetal and their infra pretty much negligible while\
    \ keeping workloads decoupled from the infra, all thanks to Annapurna HW.<br /><br\
    \ />2. Specifically talking about smart NICs, i really enjoyed working with Netronome\
    \ NICs, crafting pretty futuristic stuff within hours, well designed HW accompanied\
    \ by well described APIs makes them IMO very distinct in this segment.<br />3.\
    \ There\u2019s number of companies providing P4 front-ends to FPGA\u2019s, which\
    \ allows to define processing behavior without going into low level programming,\
    \ space to watch for.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Jeff"
