    html: 'I remember that feature. I either wrote about that a long while ago, or
      covered it in IPv6 design &amp; configuration webinar: https://www.ipspace.net/Building_Large_IPv6_Service_Provider_Networks<br
      /><br />However, AFAIK, while you can use generic prefix to number interfaces,
      you can&#39;t use in an IPv6 ACL (even on the same box) or anywhere else in
      the network. Have I missed something?'

    html: Hey Eric,<br /><br />yes, you are totally correct that the comparison between
      &quot;using RFC 1918 for IPv4 &lt;- no renumbering&quot; to &quot;using IPv6
      GUI &lt;- renumber&quot; is not fair. Indeed, renumbering an IPv4 network with
      public addresses *inside* your network would be the same work as for IPv6.<br
      /><br />Hence the post at least shows that the current practice (RFC 1918 for
      IPv4 while GUA for IPv6) is unequal when it comes to an ISP change.<br /><br
      />And yes, it forces another discussion whether ULAs are good/useful or not.
      To my mind it is still recommended to avoid any kind of NAT/NPT/whatever to
      decrease the complexity of your network. You SHOULD go for PI space. However,
      not having PI space you must balance reasons whether to use ULAs (and NAT) or
      GUAs with the risk of renumbering...<br /><br />Thanks for your note anyway.
      I&#39;ll add a sentence to the blog post stating that it is not an &quot;IPv6
      is bad&quot; thing, but rather an &quot;since we don&#39;t use public IPv4 addresses
      inside our networks, we have new challenges with IPv6 when it comes to an ISP
      change&quot;.<br /><br />Ciao,<br />Johannes<br />

    html: Hi Johannes, thanks for the note. Yes, I definitely got your original point
      as written --- the current addressing reality isn&#39;t changing so the asymmetry
      in difficulty still exists in practice. Adding a note might help misunderstanding
      for folks who are still on the fence about whether they should be deploying
      v6 at all :)<br /><br />And yes, I completely agree. NAT should be avoided unless
      absolutely necessary (AS multihoming with 2 sets of non-PI space?). The goal
      for ULAs is not to NAT66 it to the outside, but rather to put RFC 6724 to the
      test. If you construct your ACLs/rules around the ULA addresses and make sure
      that your DNS resolvers give out ULA addresses for local clients, they should
      make the right choice and connect with ULA even when a global address exists.

  html: Interesting read. I couldn&#39;t help but feel like this is an apples-to-oranges
    test, though. I can&#39;t deny that not having to renumber private IPv4 is less
    work than having to renumber IPv6, but I don&#39;t think that means that IPv6
    is intrinsically all that much harder to renumber. How well does IPv4 fare when
    you do a merger/acquisition and have to renumber or internally NAT to avoid overlapping
    use of RFC 1918 addresses? What&#39;s even worse is that the addresses might not
    be as obviously wrong in ACLs/firewall rules/service configurations because you&#39;re
    still using 10 space, but that same prefix now means something different than
    it used to.<br /><br />Another thing is that a lot of the config files and firewall
    rules that had to be modified here were governing internal access (mail, logs,
    DNS, firewall rules to reach those things, etc.). To me this strikes me as a good
    case study on the importance of deploying ULA prefixes alongside global unicast.
    I suppose it&#39;s doubly important if you can foresee having to renumber (not
    having PI space, for example). Also, ULA&#39;s randomized prefixes help it avoid
    the circumstance above where you might be forced to readdress your private space.  <br
    /><br />Nonetheless, still a good reminder that the existence of RAs and preferred
    lifetimes doesn&#39;t automagically trivialize re-addressing.

    html: Enno, this is a fantastic resource. Thanks for chiming in with this. I&#39;m
      also pleasantly surprised to see that the real world implementations aren&#39;t
      actually as bad as they could have been considering the complexity of the rules.

  html: I suppose that&#39;s why I phrased it as &quot;put[ting] RFC 6724 to the test.&quot;
    I&#39;m not as optimistic as the narrative I suggest...<br /><br />Do you know
    of any test results regarding implementations that have problems using multiple
    address classes? A lot of the case studies I&#39;ve read have more been focused
    on Happy Eyeballs I and II with v4 rather than source v6 address choice. I haven&#39;t
    done my own testing (yet) as to how well implementers actually did ...
