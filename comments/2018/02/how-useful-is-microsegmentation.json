      "html": "&gt; Having a tightly focused ACL in front of every server is infinitely (admittedly for some small value of infinity) more manageable than having a 10.000 line ACL sitting on your core router.<br /><br />This is arguable: maintaining 1-line ACLs on 10K machines is actually much harder than one 20K ACLs on single box, simply because now it&#39;s a distributed system problem. The &quot;one-giant-box&quot; approach is much more manageable, but at the same time way more fragile due to the huge blast radius (usually you see this manifested in 1+1 active/backup schemas)<br /><br />I&#39;ve seen interesting spiral turns where people first split monolithic (1+1) systems into shards, citing smaller blast radius, to later come back to monolith, this time saying how much easier it is to manage. And then again. Dialectical stages, lol.",
