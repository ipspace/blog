  html: "&quot;One of the beauties of VMware NSX is that it\u2019s fully API-based&quot;<br\
    \ /><br />A couple of points to set customer expectations here.<br /><br />1.)\
    \ While the NSX API may support all functions, PowerNSX does not.  Last I looked\
    \ some important NSX DFW and Service Composer functions were missing.<br /><br\
    \ />2.) VMware does NOT officially support PowerNSX.  Meaning that if you build\
    \ PowerNSX functions into your enterprise procedures and something goes dreadfully\
    \ wrong, you will NOT be able to rely on VMware to support you.  The frustrating\
    \ thing is that PowerCLI (vSphere) IS officially supported.  In my opinion, VMware\
    \ NSBU needs to step up and also provide full support for PowerNSX."
