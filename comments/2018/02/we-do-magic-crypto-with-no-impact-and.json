          "html": "I haven&#39;t seen MacSec claimed to be a zero overhead VPN encryption technology. MacSec was developed to be cheap, fast and use existing LAN infrastructure. For a WAN VPN it is not a good idea to use MACSec, unless you are into a low-assurance solution. In terms of Ethernet encryption IEEE is roughly 10 years behind state-of-the-art.",

      "html": "&quot;They claim to be doing encryption, so they need extra headers&quot;, would this be the case if they are using a stream cipher with OTP ;-)<br /><br />&quot;However, one has to love the zero impact on throughput. How stupid do vendors think we are?&quot;<br /><br />This gets touted a LOT.. MACsec is the most common &#39;VPN&#39; technology that claims zero overhead..<br />",
