          "html": "I have only seen some interest in the (mobile) SP space if you want to have seamless traffic engineering from the DC across your WAN. (See Slide 19 here https://www.slideshare.net/JoseListe/segment-routing-advanced-use-cases-cisco-live-2016-usa). Their upcoming business cases seem to be around 5G and low latency applications. So DC is not the traditional enterprise DC but rather hosting backend applications for the mobile network.<br /><br />As a bonus using MPLS in this case avoids any translations at the DC edge.<br /><br />Then again, the next trend is moving to SRv6 because you can more easily extend the traffic engineering part into the virtual machine (VNF). <br />So RFC1925, Rule 11 is very much alive :)",

          "html": "Well done Blake, but I think you can further simplify the network. As a matter of fact you can deploy L3VPN services and also all other BGP/MPLS services without adding LDP or internal BGP-LU to the scene. All of these services use a service (MPLS) label, it&#39;s enough to transport the resulting MPLS packet (payload + service label) using simple IP encapsulations (es MPLS over or MPLS over GRE, RFC 4023) or IP+UDP (RFC 7510). This is a perfect fit for a Data Center, just use a simple IP fabric, and you may use any IGP protocol in the underlay (or even eBGP only for large Data Centers, RFC 7938, but you have to be careful about the interworking of eBGP in the underlay and iBGP or eBGP in the overlay). KISS principle at work !!! ",

          "html": "Thanks, that&#39;s an interesting suggestion.<br /><br />From the digging I&#39;ve done, if you&#39;re not using a bog-standard tunneling protocol like MPLS, VXLAN, NVGRE, &amp; maybe Geneve (e.g. I&#39;ve had a heck of a time finding modern switch chips that just support plain-old GRE, though there are a few &quot;smart-NICs&quot; that do it), you&#39;re not going to find support for such tunneling-encapsulations-du-jour in commodity silicon.<br /><br />That said, IIRC Juniper does support MPLS over UDP on commodity silicon boxes like ACX5K for interop with their Contrail VRouter.  But I haven&#39;t seen many others.  I think most of those encapsulations are limited to implementation in software on a hypervisor/VM.<br /><br />(BTW just to be clear, my original post advocates a BGP-only fabric without an IGP or LDP/RSVP)<br /><br />&amp; honestly, I find MPLS itsself to be more straightforward to deal with on the wire than any of those X-over-IP protocols (again, I&#39;m not talking about MPLS signaling, I&#39;m talking about the data-plane implementation). It&#39;s the only one that gives you per-hop visibility into the path of your tunnels (i.e. you can log into a P router &amp; see what labels the ingress &amp; egress PE are sending you) &amp; comes with a full suite of carrier-grade OAM protocols.",

      "html": "Thanks for posting this &amp; getting everyone talking, Ivan.<br /><br />We&#39;re in agreement that if you need to add LDP, RSVP-TE, etc to your datacenter routing stack, not only does it add complexity but also limits your platform choices to OSs that support those protocols well.<br /><br />However, I feel that a lot of the confusion, complexity, &amp; &quot;woo, scary&quot; surrounding MPLS is due to the complexity &amp; scarcity of LDP &amp; RSVP implementations.<br /><br />I use RFC3017 BGP-LU in the lab to teach people MPLS without them having to learn LDP or RSVP.<br /><br />If we look at a different (&amp; hopefully more typical) scenario of a datacenter leaf/spine fabric running e.g. BGP-only IP-unnumbered commodity silicon boxes, then you add BGP-LU &amp; whatever BGP VPN address families you need to all your sessions, &amp; you&#39;re done.<br /><br />The highlights of this scenario are:<br /><br /> - BFD on your BGP sessions will get you &quot;fast-enough&quot; convergence.<br /> - if your platform(s) support it, you get L3VPN, L2VPN, VPLS, EVPN, &amp; possibly other BGP VPN techs<br /> - knobs like &quot;vpn-unequal-cost&quot; make load-balancing/multipath easy<br /> - interop with other encapsulations like LDP pseudowires &amp; EVPN VXLAN at your borders if you need it elsewhere<br /> - the P routers (&quot;spine&quot; boxes) don&#39;t need to support any of that stuff, just BGP-LU, &amp; you can use &quot;horses for courses&quot; heterogenous PE routers (&quot;leaf&quot; boxes) where you need them too.<br /> - it&#39;s just BGP, which you&#39;re going to need to learn anyway if you have any hope of scaling<br /> - &amp; all your VPNs are routed to your edge boxes in the same way, &amp; you get communities, route-targets (&amp; constrained RT filtering), RRs, MEDs, localpref, etc.<br />",

      "html": "Ivan - thank you for bringing up this discussion.<br />I do agree with Blake&#39;s last thesis  that MPLS is more straightforward (but that could be subjective due to my networking past and love to MPLS). I also believe that it is too early to say that  something-over-IP tunneling won everything. <br />There are still cases for MPLS even in DC that can be much more realistic with MPLS support in recent Linux kernel - so on commodity HW sooner or later, simplification with methods mentioned above (SR, BGP-LU or centralization), Egress Peer Engineering case or some others which are still waiting for publicity and hype :) <br />",
