May it be whitebox switches or what ever else have you. What&#39;s really ridiculous is the fact that it&#39;s still TCP/IP for over 30 years. So there&#39;s is no evolution and there won&#39;t ever be any (totally agree with RFC 1925). The only thing that&#39;s really evolving is human stupidity.",
