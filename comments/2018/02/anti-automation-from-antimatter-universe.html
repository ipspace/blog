            <div class="comment-content">I understand why you might be reluctant to disclose the vendor name but it would be great if there was a way for these sort of vendor issues to be reported and shared openly.  It would also be good to see the positive experiences that people have too.  <br /><br />Vendors constraining everyone with NDAs is not good for the industry (customers in particular).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hah, judging from the end 6.0 and 6.2 comment and my familiarity with C --- O&#39;s NGFW product, I bet you&#39;re spot on. Although to be fair, CLI is supported from a troubleshooting/diagnosis perspective, just not config. I wish they&#39;d take notes from Big Switch in their controller based architectures...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&quot;My guess in this case would be that it starts with a C and ends with a t.&quot; That seems correct from our perspective, save for the last caveat described in the post: &quot;delete all configuration from manager and implement all from the scratch&quot;.

            <div class="comment-content">and for the this reason we are still using the A*A  firewalls for East-West data-center traffic as they are really mature and robust (with no performance penalty of DPI) and use the Fortigate for North-South traffic with too many security features like AVC , IPS , AV ....the FortiOS is really reach in CLI but lack some parity on the API side.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">FirePower is a nightmare.<br />I just deleted like 5-6 lines of comment here pointing on all of the issues we had and we are having now with this &quot;revolution&quot;.<br /><br />We have enormous amount of issues using this product (and we are not using single standalone setup but enterprise customer solution) and we have asked the same:<br />- are we the only one?<br /><br />Noone will give you direct statement of course but i was pretty sure that blogs like this will come up eventually.<br /><br />Fun fact: we have provided 3 A4-size pages to vendor (bugs/feature requests) like half year ago. <br />Guess how many of these will be fixed in 6.2.3? :)<br /><br />It&#39;s not even funny anymore.<br /><br />My personal list of &quot;features&quot; <br />- there is no logical backup!<br />- if you have to re-register device to management, you will loose zone-to-interface bond and all L3 related configuration (even routing!)<br />- try to ping unreachable routed host with for example 1000 repeats (you will see magic happening)<br />- if management will accept something that device is not capable of, this results in config wipeout<br /><br />And many more ...<br /><br />And amount of TAC cases is enormous!<br /><br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">We have the same experience with this device.<br />An absolute horrifying monster of a nightmare.<br /><br />Literally none of the features is working as designed and every bug you file is either converted to a feature request (which will never actually be implemented) or as a low-priority bug. In the last 2 years, out of 40+ bugs, one was &quot;fixed&quot; but it was only fixed cosmetically, so the problem still existed.<br /><br />I still cannot wrap my brain around the fact that this is literally the most expensive NGFW that you can buy and nothing of it is really working. <br />I have next to me a cheap fortinet firewall that, although it doesn&#39;t have the same throughput, can literally do more than the FP.<br /><br />It is literally a sourcefire box, taped on top of an ASA which has been glued into a UCS server but they forgot all of it needs to be able to interface with each other.<br /><br />Also, the vendor has commented that they currently do not have the resources to fix all the bugs, let alone look at any feature requests.<br /><br />Also, if you imagine you will do things yourself over the API, API is mostly broken or does not accept commands that are in the vendor&#39;s documentation (like enabling an interface after creation - you have to still do this manually through GUI).<br />Furthermore, there is finally a backup option, but restore is not possible...<br /><br />Stay away from this &quot;next generation&quot; firewall as far as you can.<br /><br /></div>
