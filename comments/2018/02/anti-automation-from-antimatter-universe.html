            <div class="comment-content">I understand why you might be reluctant to disclose the vendor name but it would be great if there was a way for these sort of vendor issues to be reported and shared openly.  It would also be good to see the positive experiences that people have too.  <br /><br />Vendors constraining everyone with NDAs is not good for the industry (customers in particular).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">We have the same experience with this device.<br />An absolute horrifying monster of a nightmare.<br /><br />Literally none of the features is working as designed and every bug you file is either converted to a feature request (which will never actually be implemented) or as a low-priority bug. In the last 2 years, out of 40+ bugs, one was &quot;fixed&quot; but it was only fixed cosmetically, so the problem still existed.<br /><br />I still cannot wrap my brain around the fact that this is literally the most expensive NGFW that you can buy and nothing of it is really working. <br />I have next to me a cheap fortinet firewall that, although it doesn&#39;t have the same throughput, can literally do more than the FP.<br /><br />It is literally a sourcefire box, taped on top of an ASA which has been glued into a UCS server but they forgot all of it needs to be able to interface with each other.<br /><br />Also, the vendor has commented that they currently do not have the resources to fix all the bugs, let alone look at any feature requests.<br /><br />Also, if you imagine you will do things yourself over the API, API is mostly broken or does not accept commands that are in the vendor&#39;s documentation (like enabling an interface after creation - you have to still do this manually through GUI).<br />Furthermore, there is finally a backup option, but restore is not possible...<br /><br />Stay away from this &quot;next generation&quot; firewall as far as you can.<br /><br /></div>
