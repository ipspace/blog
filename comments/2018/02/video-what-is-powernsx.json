      "html": "&quot;One of the beauties of VMware NSX is that it\u2019s fully API-based&quot;<br /><br />A couple of points to set customer expectations here.<br /><br />1.) While the NSX API may support all functions, PowerNSX does not.  Last I looked some important NSX DFW and Service Composer functions were missing.<br /><br />2.) VMware does NOT officially support PowerNSX.  Meaning that if you build PowerNSX functions into your enterprise procedures and something goes dreadfully wrong, you will NOT be able to rely on VMware to support you.  The frustrating thing is that PowerCLI (vSphere) IS officially supported.  In my opinion, VMware NSBU needs to step up and also provide full support for PowerNSX.",
