  html: Now we would like to know what firewall vendor that is..<br />Not doing so
    would be akin to not helping someone in danger :)

      supported matrix.

  html: I understand why you might be reluctant to disclose the vendor name but it
    would be great if there was a way for these sort of vendor issues to be reported
    and shared openly.  It would also be good to see the positive experiences that
    people have too.  <br /><br />Vendors constraining everyone with NDAs is not good
    for the industry (customers in particular).

    html: Hah, judging from the end 6.0 and 6.2 comment and my familiarity with C
      --- O&#39;s NGFW product, I bet you&#39;re spot on. Although to be fair, CLI
      is supported from a troubleshooting/diagnosis perspective, just not config.
      I wish they&#39;d take notes from Big Switch in their controller based architectures...

  html: '&quot;My guess in this case would be that it starts with a C and ends with
    a t.&quot; That seems correct from our perspective, save for the last caveat described
    in the post: &quot;delete all configuration from manager and implement all from
    the scratch&quot;. We actually could restore a configuration (didn&#39;t have
    to rebuild from stcatch).'

  html: and for the this reason we are still using the A*A  firewalls for East-West
    data-center traffic as they are really mature and robust (with no performance
    penalty of DPI) and use the Fortigate for North-South traffic with too many security
    features like AVC , IPS , AV ....the FortiOS is really reach in CLI but lack some
    parity on the API side.

    doesn&#39;t and is managed only from external system, no one understands anything
    anymore. Dumped them and switched to FG.'

  html: 'FirePower is a nightmare.<br />I just deleted like 5-6 lines of comment here
    pointing on all of the issues we had and we are having now with this &quot;revolution&quot;.<br
    /><br />We have enormous amount of issues using this product (and we are not using
    single standalone setup but enterprise customer solution) and we have asked the
    same:<br />- are we the only one?<br /><br />Noone will give you direct statement
    of course but i was pretty sure that blogs like this will come up eventually.<br
    /><br />Fun fact: we have provided 3 A4-size pages to vendor (bugs/feature requests)
    like half year ago. <br />Guess how many of these will be fixed in 6.2.3? :)<br
    /><br />It&#39;s not even funny anymore.<br /><br />My personal list of &quot;features&quot;
    <br />- there is no logical backup!<br />- if you have to re-register device to
    management, you will loose zone-to-interface bond and all L3 related configuration
    (even routing!)<br />- try to ping unreachable routed host with for example 1000
    repeats (you will see magic happening)<br />- if management will accept something
    that device is not capable of, this results in config wipeout<br /><br />And many
    more ...<br /><br />And amount of TAC cases is enormous!<br /><br />'

  html: We have the same experience with this device.<br />An absolute horrifying
    monster of a nightmare.<br /><br />Literally none of the features is working as
    designed and every bug you file is either converted to a feature request (which
    will never actually be implemented) or as a low-priority bug. In the last 2 years,
    out of 40+ bugs, one was &quot;fixed&quot; but it was only fixed cosmetically,
    so the problem still existed.<br /><br />I still cannot wrap my brain around the
    fact that this is literally the most expensive NGFW that you can buy and nothing
    of it is really working. <br />I have next to me a cheap fortinet firewall that,
    although it doesn&#39;t have the same throughput, can literally do more than the
    FP.<br /><br />It is literally a sourcefire box, taped on top of an ASA which
    has been glued into a UCS server but they forgot all of it needs to be able to
    interface with each other.<br /><br />Also, the vendor has commented that they
    currently do not have the resources to fix all the bugs, let alone look at any
    feature requests.<br /><br />Also, if you imagine you will do things yourself
    over the API, API is mostly broken or does not accept commands that are in the
    vendor&#39;s documentation (like enabling an interface after creation - you have
    to still do this manually through GUI).<br />Furthermore, there is finally a backup
    option, but restore is not possible...<br /><br />Stay away from this &quot;next
    generation&quot; firewall as far as you can.<br /><br />
