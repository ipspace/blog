    html: There&#39;s another difference between NSX and vArmour - only one of them
      has publicly available documentation... which is also the reason I&#39;m not
      even considering writing about the other one.

    html: Totally agree with that. What I should have written is &quot;understanding
      a tightly focused ACL is infinitely simpler than understanding a conglomerate
      of 10.000 entries in a firewall rule with no history attached to them&quot;
      ;)

  html: '&gt; Having a tightly focused ACL in front of every server is infinitely
    (admittedly for some small value of infinity) more manageable than having a 10.000
    line ACL sitting on your core router.<br /><br />This is arguable: maintaining
    1-line ACLs on 10K machines is actually much harder than one 20K ACLs on single
    box, simply because now it&#39;s a distributed system problem. The &quot;one-giant-box&quot;
    approach is much more manageable, but at the same time way more fragile due to
    the huge blast radius (usually you see this manifested in 1+1 active/backup schemas)<br
    /><br />I&#39;ve seen interesting spiral turns where people first split monolithic
    (1+1) systems into shards, citing smaller blast radius, to later come back to
    monolith, this time saying how much easier it is to manage. And then again. Dialectical
    stages, lol.'

    html: 'Cisco ACI does have segmentation within EPG, but it&#39;s somewhat intricate
      to set up. You&#39;ll find more details in Cisco ACI Virtualization guide (or

  html: 'If we put Cisco ACI for example into same equation, they use EPG as Container.
    So in such case if we put all web servers of a single client within same WEB EPG
    , and someone been able to exploit web vulnerability, the blast radius for servers
    within EPG remain same. It&#39;s just that DB EPG will not be impacted, but guess
    what &quot; The attack was meant for web servers only &quot; :)<br /><br />The
    other problem to be solved now is - how do we maintain the policy consistency
    across DCs '

  html: I agree Sir, It&#39;s just that most ACI clients I know didn&#39;t implement
    it. Or if they suggest it in CVD.
