Scalable, cheaper than transit VPC&#39;s, much less complex and faster re-convergence. You can get all your normal flow logs from the routers and safely control path selection. You can also automate all the VPC provisioning and just give your Dev&#39;s an API to call if they need a new one. ",

      "html": "With regards to the CSR Transit VPC: To be fair, troubleshooting traffic flow in AWS is a PITA. There are VPC Flowlogs that help you out figuring out if traffic gets there (they are essentially firewall logs, telling you if traffic was deny or accepted) but in my experience when something goes wrong, nobody has any idea where to look. <br /><br />We deployed a CSR-based Transit VPC (there are other options, Aviatrix and Riverbed are AWS partners for this, but you can accomplish the same thing with Juniper and Fortinet) and despite the costs and bottleneck reservations you have (I share those), having a device in path where you can collect flow and do packet capture has been -very- useful.<br /><br />I generally agree with your point. The reality of troubleshooting a full mesh of VPCs with the limited tools that AWS gives us, with staff that is just learning the platforms (in our case) the Transit VPC has been worth the $$.",
