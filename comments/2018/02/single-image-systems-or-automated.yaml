    html: Based on experience with both types of deployment, the answer as usual,
      as Ivan also always says, is that  &quot;it depends&quot;. If you need orchestration,
      and don&#39;t want to do it yourself, and are willing to pay a premium for it,
      ACI or NSX or one of the other similar options may be the best route for you.
      If you want control, then you can deploy your own EVPN fabric. There is no right
      answer. For some of the customers I support, simply due to the requirement of
      &quot;one neck to choke&quot;, only realistic options are the ones like ACI
      or NSX. In others, there are options to deploy EVPN using Ansible/Salt or even
      &quot;manually&quot; (i.e. classic CLI configuration) - which is required as
      those environments require more flexibility, interoperability, and less vendor
      lock-in. Also, as Ivan also says, some lock-in is inevitable - everything really
      just depends on your requirements, budget, and resources.

    html: 'It&#39;s mostly what DixieWrecked said - either you buy a black box (QFabric,
      ACI, NSX, ...), or you buy or replicate something like Cisco NSO.<br /><br />In
      any case, you need user interface that does transactions on services data model,
      which combined with infrastructure data model gets translated into device data
      model(s) which then get translated into device configurations.<br /><br />As
      for tools: some people build their front-end stuff, or use Ansible Tower (or
      AWX) as an approximation, others use all sorts of orchestration tools from vRealize
      to HP orchestration tool to Cisco NSO (and there are, I&#39;m guessing, I few
      using Apstra).<br /><br />The back-end depends on what you need to get done.
      Ansible, Salt, running Ansible playbooks from vRealize... tons of options.<br
      /><br />And yes, a lot of that is in my courses.'

  html: In our company we need more than just some data models on a linux host which
    then get&#39;s translated by jinja2 to some config files and finally get&#39;s
    pushed down to the networking devices. We already have a version control system
    in place.  What we need is some orchestration tool which integrates our business
    logic. How do you deal with that? Please don&#39;t answer with &quot;find out
    in one of my courses&quot;.

    html: And of course you&#39;re absolutely right - we&#39;re entering the recursive
      world of lock-in (see http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/01/lock-in-is-inevitable-get-used-to-it.html)

  html: There are two fundamental ways to solve this challenge:<br /><br />&quot;if
    multivendor:&quot;<br />    Build or buy a network automation solution that translates
    high-level data model (marketers prefer to use the word Intent) into device configurations
    that are then pushed to traditional network devices;<br /><br />&quot;else:&quot;<br
    />    Buy a $vendor solution that pretends a whole network (for example, a data
    center fabric) is a single device. This trend started with shared-control-plane
    approaches like stackable switches, Cisco VSS and HP IRF, and was made way more
    scalable with reasonable architectures like Juniper QFabric, Cisco ACI, or Pluribus
    Networks Netvisor.<br />

  html: 'The answer to that in the Internet was of course the middle ground. A bunch
    of open standards gets published and the market bears multiple vendors that provide
    the pieces that stick together along standardized interfaces. Advantages were
    so overwhelming that it has proven the prevalent model of building networking
    for a long time now. Multiple vendors implementations shook IME bugs out much
    better (beside doing the hard work of scaling and supporting) than a free, best-effort,
    a.k.a. &quot;open source reference implementation&quot; and the versioning/work
    of standards prevents the &quot;big, ugly forklift&quot; upgrades and &quot;any
    color as long it&#39;s black&quot; offerings in the market. Just my 2c ... '
