    html: Hi Stefan, thanks for your comment! ;-)<br />Basically, field technician
      is given a MGMT LB + /30 to set on WAN interface, He has to set that on site
      + a default route to remote WAN IP + local authentication and here we go...<br
      />As we have ethernet support in most the case, that&#39;s not something too
      difficult for them. <br />Default WAN interface is always the same depending
      on CPE model...<br />i&#39;ll try to automatically generate boot template for
      them in the next few months... but it&#39;s step by step right now!

  html: Awesome build! Any idea how he/people in general handle the chicken-egg problem?
    How does the CPE become reachable from the Ansible host to finalize the config?
    A Cisco zero install method? Generiek DHCP-kinda config?
