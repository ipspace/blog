  html: Ivan, I retired a couple of years ago so no longer get NDA briefings on ASICs.  The
    arms race between the ASIC providers on hash algorithms (ie ECMP) is at a much
    higher level of complexity than indicated above, the hyperscalers have probably
    &quot;helped&quot; with even more requirements on ECMP hashing since I retired;
    and all of this is under NDAs so deep no one is likely to answer the question
    central to this blog.

  html: There&#39;s of course also the question whether it *matters* that the distribution
    is uneven.  If you happen to get a 40%-40%-20% load towards your spines from a
    certain leaf instead of the ideal 33%-34%-33%, you will still be better off than
    if you have two spines, getting 50%-50%.<br /><br />Remember also that if an uneven
    distribution like that is bad for you, then you are in trouble if you have four
    spines and one of them fail...<br /><br />Also, a good implementation of ECMP
    will add a local identifier, something that uniquely identifies the switch/router
    itself, e.g. its own MAC address or serial number, into the mix.  Otherwise, an
    identical switch downstream would get the same hashes for every packet it receives,
    and only utilize one of *its* ECMP outputs.  I believe at least the Broadcom Trident
    II and Tomahawk chips do this.  Each leaf switch will then get a different distribution
    over its odd number of uplinks, and the total load over the spines might even
    out.

  html: Today&#39;s ECMP hash algorithms and bucket-to-link mappings are non-uniform,
    even for even/binary number of links. E.g., given two spines and a perfectly hashable
    mix of packets, you might find 52% and 48% distribution.  This is all great and
    no one cares about hash polarization anymore. On the flip-side, fragmented packets
    are handled worse today than ever before -- something that hurts poorly-deployed
    overlays and crypto.<br /><br />I find that the number of spines is more a function
    of  physical environment. E.g., number of available leaf uplink ports, power/cable
    diversity, red/blue color coding, familiarity for the operations folks, etc.

  html: 'Thanks for posting this, Ivan.<br /><br />Everything I&#39;m designing right
    now that doesn&#39;t need crazy amounts of bandwidth revolves around triplets.  Why?<br
    /><br /> - smallest # of boxes that will get you true N+1 redundancy (not 2N).  I
    find 3x to be the smallest you can get &amp; still call it &quot;leaf/spine fabric&quot;
    <br /> - law of diminishing returns (50/33/25/20/etc); moving from 50% to 33%
    gives the most incremental gain, by a factor of &gt;2<br /> - there are many more
    ToRs out there with 6 uplink ports than with 8, &amp; they&#39;re cheaper. <br
    /> - getting budget for the 3rd box is hard enough; the 4th one is truly a luxury
    in many orgs<br /> - a triangle is the smallest redundant full mesh, with the
    simplest rules:  &quot;connect this one to the other two&quot;.  None of the links
    are optional if you want any redundancy whatsoever.<br /><br />Anyone care to
    add others?'

  html: Somewhat tangential...<br /><br />We&#39;re working on a new DC Fabric in
    the near future and while 2 spines would serve us well for bandwidth and resiliency,
    I&#39;m contemplating forcing a minimum of 3 spines just so no vendor/engineer
    will waste our time calling MC-LAG between two core switches leaf-spine.

    html: It would be great to know which Broadcom hardware supports hashing based
      on flow label, whether it&#39;s enabled by default or not, and if not which
      vendor enabled that by default (I know it Arista EOS started using flow label
      in ECMP hash a while ago, but I always understood it had to be configured).
