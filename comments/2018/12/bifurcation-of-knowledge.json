But 6 was too much and once we had the 6th CCIE, one of them had to leave the company. At that time we always had A-, P-, and E-level guys. So there were always people at the middle-level dreaming about being CCIE.<br /><br />What I want to say: I do observe this bi-polar World now. The A-level guys believe in google &amp; stackoverflow powered engineering. <br />These guys are cheaper and solve most of the technical problems (because most regular problems are solvable through power of google as most problems are not very unique).<br />And only few well paid E-level guys are employed as &#39;master-minds&#39;. Like we (in the past) needed only 5 CCIE and were not willing to pay more for E-level staff.<br /><br />I see another fenomena - the E-level staff is not willing to share their knowledge with the youngest generation...<br />",

      "html": "I think that nowadays there is something like a fundamentalism with SDN (or &quot;SD...&quot;). Pretty much everything today in networking is pretended to be solved with a solution based on this magic term. I compare this to what happens with &quot;democracy&quot; in most of the occidental societies. <br /><br />First, the term is vague, imprecise. A lot of engineers think they know what\u00b4s the meaning (a known unknown) but just a few really know what\u00b4s the accurate definition. Some vendors use this to sell their products and to say that it solves most if not all the problems/inconveniences that traditional networks have. It happens the same to democracy: the term is vague and almost anyone think they know what it really is. However, the accurate definition is known by just a few. In a similar way, some politicians use a lot the word democracy to say that this magic word would solve most if not all the problems of the citizens.<br /><br />Second, sometimes the vendors do not provide documentation in depth describing their SD.. solutions. Therefore, your option is to trust and accept or untrust and reject. I think that politicians sometimes do something similar, avoiding commitment and relying on democracy and promises.<br /><br />As a consequence of that, I think that some engineers believe in the SD.. like a gospel without really understanding the solutions, or at least asking and pushing the vendors to provide more documentation than just a ppt and a demo. I see some lack of critical thinking in networking nowadays. ",

Fewer low-profile engineers as automation is gonna do their work but more high-profile engineers to understand, manage, design and troubleshoot (all supported by the automation of course) the added complexity of the automation itself.",
