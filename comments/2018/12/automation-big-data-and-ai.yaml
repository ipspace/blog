    html: One of the potential use cases (and as I wrote, I remain skeptical) is anomaly
      detection - compare current state to &quot;usual&quot; state and report if they
      differ by more than X. <br /><br />Obviously the challenge is how to figure
      out what the &quot;usual&quot; state is and that&#39;s where machine learning
      could be helpful.<br /><br />Automated actions based on ML results is a totally
      different story. I wouldn&#39;t be as brave as that yet... but it all depends
      on how much you care about false positives and false negatives.

    html: 'Years ago I was involved in the IPS deployment - the IPS needed to learn
      what is the baseline: which anomalies are normal;) And act accordingly. Yes,
      customer had to be brave enough to break the connectivity in case of anomaly
      detected...<br /><br />Of course we should know what anomaly is normal in the
      network to not be misled when real issue happens - to avoid investigation of
      anomalies which were &quot;normal&quot;. I would like to avoid discussion why
      certain anomalies must retain in the network...'

  html: I wonder what is the simplest case where AI fed by telemetry data would help.
    <br />To avoid congestion we need to add extra BW at the &quot;predicted&quot;
    time (re-route traffic through other links?).<br />If we have &quot;magically&quot;
    gained knowledge/prediction (through any sort of AI) we need to act upon this
    knowledge i.e. add new BW to mitigate the congestion.<br />So we need to have
    this extra BW anyway. <br /><br />It&#39;s still a mystery for me...<br />
