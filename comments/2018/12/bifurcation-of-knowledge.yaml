    html: I don&#39;t miss the days of being CLI jockey ;) Looks like our paths are
      parting... too bad our acquaintance was always one-sided.

    html: I was writing about times around 2000 year. Brain dumps were not available
      at least in my country a that time. People had at least 7-8 years of experience
      in nation wide network deployments activities. <br />Yes, CCIE now is not as
      important as in XX century;)

  html: 'I think the main driver is money. I used to work for a company where twe
    had alway 5 CCIE employed. Never 6+. Every year new employee used to pass CCIE
    exam. But 6 was too much and once we had the 6th CCIE, one of them had to leave
    the company. At that time we always had A-, P-, and E-level guys. So there were
    always people at the middle-level dreaming about being CCIE.<br /><br />What I
    want to say: I do observe this bi-polar World now. The A-level guys believe in
    google &amp; stackoverflow powered engineering. <br />These guys are cheaper and
    solve most of the technical problems (because most regular problems are solvable
    through power of google as most problems are not very unique).<br />And only few
    well paid E-level guys are employed as &#39;master-minds&#39;. Like we (in the
    past) needed only 5 CCIE and were not willing to pay more for E-level staff.<br
    /><br />I see another fenomena - the E-level staff is not willing to share their
    knowledge with the youngest generation...<br />'

  html: "I think that nowadays there is something like a fundamentalism with SDN (or\
    \ &quot;SD...&quot;). Pretty much everything today in networking is pretended\
    \ to be solved with a solution based on this magic term. I compare this to what\
    \ happens with &quot;democracy&quot; in most of the occidental societies. <br\
    \ /><br />First, the term is vague, imprecise. A lot of engineers think they know\
    \ what\xB4s the meaning (a known unknown) but just a few really know what\xB4\
    s the accurate definition. Some vendors use this to sell their products and to\
    \ say that it solves most if not all the problems/inconveniences that traditional\
    \ networks have. It happens the same to democracy: the term is vague and almost\
    \ anyone think they know what it really is. However, the accurate definition is\
    \ known by just a few. In a similar way, some politicians use a lot the word democracy\
    \ to say that this magic word would solve most if not all the problems of the\
    \ citizens.<br /><br />Second, sometimes the vendors do not provide documentation\
    \ in depth describing their SD.. solutions. Therefore, your option is to trust\
    \ and accept or untrust and reject. I think that politicians sometimes do something\
    \ similar, avoiding commitment and relying on democracy and promises.<br /><br\
    \ />As a consequence of that, I think that some engineers believe in the SD..\
    \ like a gospel without really understanding the solutions, or at least asking\
    \ and pushing the vendors to provide more documentation than just a ppt and a\
    \ demo. I see some lack of critical thinking in networking nowadays. "

  html: Totally agree with you guys. The funny thing is that I guess in the end money
    will be spread just differently in terms of expertise. Fewer low-profile engineers
    as automation is gonna do their work but more high-profile engineers to understand,
    manage, design and troubleshoot (all supported by the automation of course) the
    added complexity of the automation itself.

    and network software. the software guys did the automation and programming.<br
