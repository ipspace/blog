There&#39;s only one place sharing such ideas ;))<br /><br />With all due respect to all the good work Packet Pushers are doing in their many podcasts, sponsored content = $vendor telling us what we should buy, regardless of how well it&#39;s sugarcoated in a technical discussion... and more so if the $vendor happens to be the only one selling said technology. That&#39;s why I stopped doing sponsored webinars. <br /><br />As for &quot;no strings attached&quot; to sponsored content, ask yourself who is the customer and what (or who) is the product.",

      "html": "IMO, all main vendors will support SRv6 in HW sooner or later just because... The  SRv6 saga will be also dominant in everyone&#39;s talks. Besides that support of SRH and IPv6 are needed for that (technical side), I see (I also work for another vendor :)  but this is just my personal opinion) the main benefit of SRv6 is in potential distributed network programmability (function+locator encoding in SID) as it is described in draft-filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming.<br /><br />I have not seen SRv6 in production cases yet in my region, but people talk about it.<br />For average operator which has traditional MPLS based network, IMO, main concern is a justification of all SRv6 migration spendings and efforts. For mobile SPs, 5G could be such potential case. But again - as Ivan often says: &quot;it depends&quot; :)",
