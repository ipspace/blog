    html: 'I used to use JUNOS based VM to build PoC labs many times. <br />It was
      a failure when I switched to the real HW - the behavior of failure &amp; recovery
      scenarios, BFD timing, multicast implementation is different.<br />To my understanding:
      too many features rely on hw (slow path vs fast path packet processing). There
      differences in implementation &amp; optimization between HW and VM.<br /><br
      />Probably there are rare case where the effort in the virtual lab is worth
      the time spent on. Even the education is questionable - I prefer learning &quot;real&quot;
      behavior of the devices... <br />'

    html: '@Anonymous: you&#39;re slipping. I know it&#39;s hard figuring out a snarky
      remark or insult for every day of the week, but you should really try something
      more intelligent.<br /><br />@Gogus: Agreed. Management- and Control plane features
      usually work as expected, data plane (in particular packet forwarding) is a
      hit-or-miss, more so in devices that do hardware-based forwarding in real life.'

    html: Most participants build their own virtual lab using whatever virtual devices
      from $vendors they use in production networks.

  html: Can a participant without access to hardware devices benefit from your course
    as much as someone with a hardware lab thanks to this virtual lab? Will there
    be some fees required to build the virtual lab?

  html: 'Been building virtual labs for years for passing exams or to demo to our
    customers how automation can change their lifes. Nowaydays i build everything
    in EVE-NG, vMX, CSR1k, Fortigate, Arista, Ostinato, etc, etc. The control plane
    behaves the same and even the dataplane is quite robust if the vendor supports
    it. <br /><br />1) Build a webportal<br />2) Use netconf/restconf to do network
    wide transactions<br />3) Demo / POC<br />4) Build in production '
