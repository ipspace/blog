          "html": "I used to use JUNOS based VM to build PoC labs many times. <br />It was a failure when I switched to the real HW - the behavior of failure &amp; recovery scenarios, BFD timing, multicast implementation is different.<br />To my understanding: too many features rely on hw (slow path vs fast path packet processing). There differences in implementation &amp; optimization between HW and VM.<br /><br />Probably there are rare case where the effort in the virtual lab is worth the time spent on. Even the education is questionable - I prefer learning &quot;real&quot; behavior of the devices... <br />",

I know it&#39;s hard figuring out a snarky remark or insult for every day of the week, but you should really try something more intelligent.<br /><br />@Gogus: Agreed. Management- and Control plane features usually work as expected, data plane (in particular packet forwarding) is a hit-or-miss, more so in devices that do hardware-based forwarding in real life.",
