    html: Totally agree, I usually go with a Two Throat To Choke (TTTC) minimum for
      any internally supported system :-). A lot of our customers at <a href="https://www.loadbalancer.org/"
      rel="nofollow">Loadbalancer.org</a> are simply looking for a reliable commercially
      supported replacement for a perfectly functional internal system - that no one
      knows how to fix :-).

  html: Welcome to reality describes it very well ;-) Design process usually includes
    the One Throat To Choke (OTTC) factor. That&#39;s one of the reasons &quot;Buy&quot;
    wins over &quot;Build&quot; most of the times. You can build it cheaper, free
    from legacy of unused features and customized to your business needs. But if it
    can&#39;t pass the OTTC factor it will not be chosen. Unless someone accepts the
    risk, of course. Usually this is a short time solution used by some managers.
    They save a lot in the first year budget, introducing open-source solutions and
    a lot of hidden operations costs and tech debt then get it&#39;s bonus for the
    savings and leave the company before everything burns. I&#39;ve seen this happen
    a few times.

    html: What VM based solution are you talking about?

    html: F5 is an example. Gives you a vendor for choking, while escaping the need
      for appliances (which tend to have awesome step functions for cost vs performance.)

  html: If you need a vendor based load-balancing solution in modern topologies that
    support ECMP I&#39;d encourage taking a look at a VM based solution with anycast.
    The cost function is a lot smoother.

    html: VMware NSX is just GUI/API in front of HAProxy because text configuration
      files are such a pain ;))... and it seems to give you a sliver of what HAProxy
      could do (too lazy to do feature-by-feature comparison :D)

  html: What can e.g. F5 do what HAProxy can&#39;t?<br />What about commercial supported
    HAProxy solutions like VMWare NSX? Do those only use opensource HAProxy plus add
    a GUI?

  html: With OPNsense you can use HAProxy and Nginx as reverse proxy with a nice GUI,
    also offering WAF features. The only cost is time (as usual with Open Source)
