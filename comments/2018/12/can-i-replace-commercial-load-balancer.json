A lot of our customers at <a href=\"https://www.loadbalancer.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Loadbalancer.org</a> are simply looking for a reliable commercially supported replacement for a perfectly functional internal system - that no one knows how to fix :-).",

      "html": "Welcome to reality describes it very well ;-) Design process usually includes the One Throat To Choke (OTTC) factor. That&#39;s one of the reasons &quot;Buy&quot; wins over &quot;Build&quot; most of the times. You can build it cheaper, free from legacy of unused features and customized to your business needs. But if it can&#39;t pass the OTTC factor it will not be chosen. Unless someone accepts the risk, of course. Usually this is a short time solution used by some managers. They save a lot in the first year budget, introducing open-source solutions and a lot of hidden operations costs and tech debt then get it&#39;s bonus for the savings and leave the company before everything burns. I&#39;ve seen this happen a few times.",
