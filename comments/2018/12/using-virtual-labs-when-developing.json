Even without that, the virtual lab might still be useful to test your automation solution.",

      "html": "This is exactly what I ran into last week. In trying to set up a new lab environment for various automation tests I thought I&#39;d revisit the various vendors&#39; virtual offerings. Cumulus VX and Arista vEOS are pretty easy, both in getting a (free) download and booting up some virtual appliances. Kudos. But e.g. JunOS, IOS-* and NX-OS on the other hand are a challenge (read: I gave up, especially on a vendor who claims they provide a &#39;free&#39; edition that nonetheless requires a maintenance contract ?!).<br /><br />I don&#39;t understand why vendors don&#39;t seem to get that labbing shouldn&#39;t be a business model. It&#39;s in everyone&#39;s best interest to be able to run infrastructure deployment pipelines with daily builds, CI/CD, etc. For that we need access to easy to set up virtual labs. Yes, there are cloud and hosted offerings but that rather limits automation and CI/CD use cases. If vendors are afraid I&#39;m going to use their virtual appliance in production environments: by all means, limit a free edition in e.g. throughput or number of ports. Don&#39;t limit the feature set though. (which reminds me of a certain vendor where OSPFv2 is included in the standard license and OSPFv3 - IPv6, requires an expensive license. WTH?).<br /><br />But I guess the cloudy pay-as-you-go and subscription era only brought us new business models, not more cloud-native-software-like benefits.<br />Real SDN should also include thinking and acting like cloud native software (delivery teams).<br />",
