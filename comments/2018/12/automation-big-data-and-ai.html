            <div class="comment-content">I wonder what is the simplest case where AI fed by telemetry data would help. <br />To avoid congestion we need to add extra BW at the &quot;predicted&quot; time (re-route traffic through other links?).<br />If we have &quot;magically&quot; gained knowledge/prediction (through any sort of AI) we need to act upon this knowledge i.e. add new BW to mitigate the congestion.<br />So we need to have this extra BW anyway. <br /><br />It&#39;s still a mystery for me...<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">One of the potential use cases (and as I wrote, I remain skeptical) is anomaly detection - compare current state to &quot;usual&quot; state and report if they differ by more than X. <br /><br />Obviously the challenge is how to figure out what the &quot;usual&quot; state is and that&#39;s where machine learning could be helpful.<br /><br />Automated actions based on ML results is a totally different story. I wouldn&#39;t be as brave as that yet... but it all depends on how much you care about false positives and false negatives.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Years ago I was involved in the IPS deployment - the IPS needed to learn what is the baseline: which anomalies are normal;) And act accordingly. Yes, customer had to be brave enough to break the connectivity in case of anomaly detected...<br /><br />Of course we should know what anomaly is normal in the network to not be misled when real issue happens - to avoid investigation of anomalies which were &quot;normal&quot;. I would like to avoid discussion why certain anomalies must retain in the network...</div>
