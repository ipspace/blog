Common examples: ECMP load balancing based on L3/4 headers, or ICMP replies on TTL expiration. <br /><br />Since there&#39;s no TTL in Ethernet networks, and VXLAN uses UDP to capture payload entropy, these two common examples don&#39;t apply to VXLAN at all.",

      "html": "Heya Ivan, great post as always. <br /><br />Got kind of a dumb question in regards to the first point that you raised (No protocol identifier). In MPLS, there seems to be new developments (one in draft named draft-xu-mpls-payload-protocol-identifier-05, and one seemingly in RFC7274 but this one is not exactly what is being talked about here) that do indeed offer that type of functionality. Albeit I will agree that it&#39;s likely pretty much not going to be used by vendors all that often. That all being said though, doesn&#39;t tacking more onto the MPLS label kinda defeat the purpose of it being the low overhead forwarding that it was meant to be in the first place? To me I see VXLAN kinda doing the same thing (over IP though) with Ethernet specific payloads. I don&#39;t see how it truly is a shortcoming to be honest, especially since one can signal a protocol payload type using LDP and RSVP.<br /><br />Just some thoughts I had. Here&#39;s hoping it&#39;s not detracting from your post here. ",

      "html": "I&#39;ll say it, time and time again, standards are generally an inch deep, and a mile wide, covering the most &quot;common&quot; of use cases. It has been networking vendors who have traditionally extended upon these standards to solve more complex, and niche, problems, or sometimes just providing something new that may solve other problems. Either way, why are people so concerned with the data-plane encapsulation? I think most of us can agree it is the control-plane where the real &quot;magic&quot; happens and where we start to develop, and deploy, real solutions for customers. <br /><br />I have a feeling there is one specific company out there who has a vested interest in seeing Geneve &quot;take off&quot;, just one in particular. Geneve offers the promise of &quot;interoperability&quot; because it&#39;ll be &quot;standard&quot; and &quot;flexible&quot;. Well, people said the same of the many spanning-tree protocols and I&#39;ve, more than I can count, found two vendors couldn&#39;t even run MST in harmony. I don&#39;t see where VXLAN, or MP-BGP EVPN too, fell short to be &quot;interoperable&quot; among vendors, if anything, it is a vendor &quot;thing&quot; to work out, not the data-plane encap protocol. Just my 2 cents...",
