Wouldn&#39;t that allow you to simplify your core (in reference to your CSC remark) network? I know you can have controllers in SR networks determining the path by stacking labels, but it can also be a bit more &quot;hands-off&quot; as labels are already in the IGP, so a controller is not a hard requirement to create a label-stack.",

The answer is BGP... what exactly was the question ;)) But yeah, that definitely increases the scalability by an order of magnitude.<br /><br />Speaking of &quot;large DCs running MLPS&quot; - do they have MPLS at the WAN edge to select egress WAN interface on HTTP(S) proxy servers, or do they use MPLS as the core fabric transport?<br /><br />Thank you!",

I&#39;m in no way advocating to run MPLS in DC, especially not for TE reasons as some of our Cisco friends may suggest :) There&#39;s number of a rather large DCs that run MPLS, so mileage may very. I&#39;m a big believer in SRinUDP architecture (based on RFC7510) that allows to program (programmatically interact with)WAN for end2end path DC-WAN(with TE)-DC.
