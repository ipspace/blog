      "html": "Well, to be honest, the (A) problem is not that difficult to solve. Just connect your containers to IPVLAN/MACVLAN interfaces and all of a sudden you factored out all possible virtual NATs and bridges. The (B) problem is also easy. The current generation of VNFs are simply BNFs (physical servers) wrapped as VMs, so they will use the same service discovery mechanism they used before, which usually is statically assigned IPs with maybe something like DNS SRV on top, but again nothing new and definitely not container-native service discovery. The (C) problem is solvable with a combination of SR-IOV, MACVLAN and DPDK inside the container or various smart NICs with hardware offloads.<br />In my experience, the biggest issue with the whole VNF story is that they still use the same (legacy) assumptions and HA mechanisms they did in the baremetal world. So things like VRRP between container/VMs is a common thing. One of the worst things you can see though is some dataplane VNFs requiring dynamic routing peering with the network underlay. Think OSPF+BFD with BGP on top that need to peer with your TOR switch. In the end, after you&#39;ve satisfied all their requirements, the VNF gets pinned to a single server, which effectively turns it back into a baremetal NF, with a few intermediate container and VM layers in between. Let&#39;s call this 5G.",

      "html": "Sure, it makes sense that doing things on commodity hardware is cheaper than doing things on bespoke hardware. But in practice, NFV purists in general (and Telcos in particular) often (incorrectly) translate this into &quot;everything should be done in software on general purpose CPUs&quot;. There are many things that can be done orders of magnitude more efficiently and cheaply in hardware specificically designed for that task rather than in general purpose hardware. Forwarding packets is an obvious example. Machine learning is a more recent one. That said, the non-general-purpose hardware designed specifically for the task can still be commodity. &quot;Commodity hardware&quot; does not necessarily imply &quot;general purpose CPUs&quot;.",
