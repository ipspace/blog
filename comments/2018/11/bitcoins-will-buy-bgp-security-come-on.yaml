    html: You did read the &quot;BGP routing security is a business problem&quot;
      post I linked to, and the original post by Russ White, did you?<br /><br />Route
      leaking and hijacking is solvable without any new technology (solutions described
      in RFC 7454 are good enough), if only there would be interest and commercial
      motivation in solving it. Right now it seems like nobody is willing to foot
      the bill.

    html: Yes, I read the two posts before. So you would rely on the quality of IRR
      data and ISPs filtering prefixes for you? Well, tell that to the marines. Why
      not just doing DNSSEC without cryptography?

    html: Why would you not trust the IRR data? Oh wait... because nobody is motivated
      enough to keep it current... become nobody has the guts (or motivation) to enforce
      it, apart from Job Snijders.<br /><br />And how do you think RPKI will change
      things? It&#39;s just another database that needs to be kept up-to-date, and
      if nobody is punished for not keeping the data current, nothing will ever change.

    html: And who guarantees that the data from IRR is valid? The users themselves?
      You must be joking. It&#39;s about trust and &quot;not another database to maintain&quot;.
      The problem is the enforcement of the cryptography. No one takes responsibility
      for that. Same for DNSSEC. If it would be enforced and you don&#39;t participate,
      your public subnets become unreachable through invalidation. I bet you then
      quickly move your fat fingers to come back online.

    html: '&gt; And who guarantees that the data from IRR is valid? The users themselves?
      You must be joking. <br /><br />Why? PGP solved a long time ago this problem
      using the Web of Trust concept, users validate themselves<br /><br />&gt; If
      it would be enforced and you don&#39;t participate, your public subnets become
      unreachable through invalidation<br /><br />I think that&#39;s a trade off between
      security and usability, and from people with experience using IPSEC and suffering
      all the weird failures and strange problems, they don&#39;t want their sessions
      failing because of this'

    html: Great idea. You know how PGP works? How do you manage let&#39;s say 100&#39;000
      public keys? How does PGP scale? Maybe you missed the topic it&#39;s not about
      email security.

    html: I think that I&#39;m not missing the topic, just I didn&#39;t articulate
      it well enough :) <br />I tried to mean that if you use PGP to do the updates
      to IRR http://www.radb.net/support/authentication1.php it&#39;s reasonably secure,
      and nobody can add malicious data.<br />Then, if you use filters based in the
      IRR data and you are not updating the data, you have the results that you are
      proposing<br />&gt;If it would be enforced and you don&#39;t participate, your
      public subnets become unreachable through invalidation. I bet you then quickly
      move your fat fingers to come back online.<br /><br />By the way, PGP keyservers
      are handling more than 5M keys nowadays https://sks-keyservers.net/status/key_development.php
      ;)<br />

  html: It seems that you belittle the situation. Route leaking/hijacking is a real
    problem. But the RPKI thing fails because of the small percentage of participants
    (how much is the adoption of RPKI?). It&#39;s certainly a business problem but
    that insight doesn&#39;t solve the existing problem.
