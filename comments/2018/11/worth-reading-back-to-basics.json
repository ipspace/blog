          "html": "Stack Overflow is a great resource if you need a quick-and-dirty answer to a particular question. Obviously that works best if you have the big picture and are just missing a detail. After years of programming in Perl I still use Google (usually landing at Stack Overflow) to find some simple answers because I&#39;m too old to remember all the minutiae.<br /><br />OTOH, using Stack Overflow as your sole source-of-truth without ever investing time into understanding the bigger picture leads you to where you deserve to be ;))",

Shut down the &quot;Stack Overflow&quot; and the software development productivity will drop significantly;) Just because &quot;copy &amp; paste&quot; engineering is cheaper than hiring true engineers who know the Basics perfectly and understand what they do.

      "html": "Funny this, just yesterday me and my SO had a conversation in the car about just this issue. I say funny, because the same applies to (e.g.) archeology in the field and computer science (i.e. everywhere). If a university doesn&#39;t teach it&#39;s students the reasoning that went into boring stuff behind surveys and measuring, you&#39;re missing crucial background and context. However advanced your (GPS) technology, a basic mistake will be hard or impossible to diagnose and fix later.<br /><br />talking about older posts, head exploding programmer related basics :)<br />https://lwn.net/Articles/250967/<br />",
