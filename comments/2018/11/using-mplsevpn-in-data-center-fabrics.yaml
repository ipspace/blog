    html: 'Segment routing using OSPF or IS-IS as control plane carries labels in
      router LSAs, so the whole MPLS domain has to be a single OSPF/IS-IS area.<br
      /><br />Obviously you could get around that limitation by using a controller
      that would install labels (or label stacks) in edge nodes... but the question
      remains: what would you get with that?'

  html: If I&#39;m not mistaken, with Segment Routing you&#39;d have MPLS domain wide
    labels as labels are in the IGP. Wouldn&#39;t that allow you to simplify your
    core (in reference to your CSC remark) network? I know you can have controllers
    in SR networks determining the path by stacking labels, but it can also be a bit
    more &quot;hands-off&quot; as labels are already in the IGP, so a controller is
    not a hard requirement to create a label-stack.

    html: How could I have missed that. The answer is BGP... what exactly was the
      question ;)) But yeah, that definitely increases the scalability by an order
      of magnitude.<br /><br />Speaking of &quot;large DCs running MLPS&quot; - do
      they have MPLS at the WAN edge to select egress WAN interface on HTTP(S) proxy
      servers, or do they use MPLS as the core fabric transport?<br /><br />Thank
      you!

  html: 'Ivan,<br /><br />You could use BGP to distribute SIDs - draft-ietf-idr-bgp-prefix-sid,
    there&#39;s XR implementation, I believe Juniper should have one too... I&#39;m
    in no way advocating to run MPLS in DC, especially not for TE reasons as some
    of our Cisco friends may suggest :) There&#39;s number of a rather large DCs that
    run MPLS, so mileage may very. I&#39;m a big believer in SRinUDP architecture
    (based on RFC7510) that allows to program (programmatically interact with)WAN
    for end2end path DC-WAN(with TE)-DC. More info in MPLS Segment Routing in IP Networks

  html: On hypervisors both Contrail and Nuage support(ed) MPLSoGRE data planes, with
    Contrail additionally supporting MPLSoUDP.<br />MPLSoGRE not being very ECMP friendly
    is probably the motivation for moving to a udp based transport. In that sense
    not much of a difference between MPLSoUDP and VXLAN, except for resource overheads
    in hardware/software perhaps.

    it&#39;s beaten in every conceivable way by the competing Juniper platform, including
    cost.

  html: 'One could also consider VXLAN and MPLS coexistence.  As in east-west traffic
    domain over VXLAN and north-south traffic domain (across WAN) over MPLS.  CE attach
    in VXLAN contexts.  Local FE and external routes are selectively exported across
    VXLAN VRF and MPLS VRF (or global table) at leaf for north-south flows.  BE-BE
    and BE-FE flows stay VXLAN.  Only FE leaf need the MPLS+VXLAN capabilities.  Best
    of both worlds. '
