Unfortunately the journey through the broccoli forest of despair (to paraphrase @cloudtoad) is long and arduous.<br /><br />I&#39;m also guessing you&#39;re perfectly aligned with David&#39;s thinking ;)",

      "html": "Isn&#39;t about top-down approach  - do automation for the business purpose to align with strategic business goals (e.g automate to generate consistent configuration files for all devices when you want to add new VPN branch)? At the high level you think about VPN branches - you may even have DSL which allows &quot;add&quot; / &quot;remove&quot; VPN sites. But the work flow associated with &quot;adding&quot; / &quot;removing&quot; VPN branches is automated.<br />I have been using this approach for many years.<br /><br /><br />Otherwise you automate just to automate uncorrelated pieces without high level goal, and you enjoy small successes (e.g. &quot;I was able to collect logs&quot;). Yes, this might be useful but it is not always worth the effort spent on automation.<br /><br />I think that automation with higher level of abstraction (above the device&#39; level) makes real sense...<br />",
