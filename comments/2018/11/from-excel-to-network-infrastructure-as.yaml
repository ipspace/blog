    html: 'What you&#39;re talking about is an abstraction layer, not infrastructure-as-code.<br
      /><br />Ask yourself: HOW do you want to consume those APIs? Using GUI?'

    html: I want to consume the APIs programmatically (declarative), store my states
      in files and track it with a version control system. With the imperative approach
      I&#39;ve gained nothing (it&#39;s just configuration templating).

  html: What you and your friends understand by IaC is too little abstracted from
    my POV. I want to consume services through APIs and not dealing with implementation
    details (for example assigning VLANs to ports by editing text files).

  html: Excel can be useful for these kind of things. I&#39;ve built JUNOS configs
    for labbing purposes with lots of logical-systems and all IP addresses and Logical-tunnel
    interface-numbers were calculated by Excel.
