    html: That&#39;s not gonna happen in industries hosting hundreds of crapplications,
      like banks for instance. That&#39;s not even thinkable due to overall cost /
      poorly paid off-shored developers and so on. Even so software architecture might
      be redesigned, it will take years. I&#39;ll be retired since a long time ago
      if that happens. :) You can&#39;t imagine how many dev teams don&#39;t even
      want to think about switching to agile. Agile dev teams is just the tip of the
      icerberg.

  html: It is back to that old adage, do you architect your network around your application(s),
    or your application(s) around your network. If both &quot;suck&quot;  well you
    know the rest.
