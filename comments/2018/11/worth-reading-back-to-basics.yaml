    html: Stack Overflow is a great resource if you need a quick-and-dirty answer
      to a particular question. Obviously that works best if you have the big picture
      and are just missing a detail. After years of programming in Perl I still use
      Google (usually landing at Stack Overflow) to find some simple answers because
      I&#39;m too old to remember all the minutiae.<br /><br />OTOH, using Stack Overflow
      as your sole source-of-truth without ever investing time into understanding
      the bigger picture leads you to where you deserve to be ;))

  html: 'The post had been published 7 years before the &quot;Stack Overflow&quot;
    was founded (btw. by the same guy). Shut down the &quot;Stack Overflow&quot; and
    the software development productivity will drop significantly;) Just because &quot;copy
    &amp; paste&quot; engineering is cheaper than hiring true engineers who know the
    Basics perfectly and understand what they do. '

  html: I think it&#39;s a matter of generation - some of us started programming in
    the pre-Internet era (when you programmed VAX machine where the only output was
    a printer you needed to spend substantial number of hours to avoid stupid mistakes,
    OR when you needed to erase EPROM memory of an MCU your mistakes were time consuming).
    <br /><br />Now we (me too) only needs to find quickly some details but general
    understanding (the basics are understood). <br /><br />Younger generations may
    follow &quot;try &amp; error&quot; path where the &quot;Stack Overflow&quot; is
    really helpful when you do not have enough experience &amp; education.

  html: Funny this, just yesterday me and my SO had a conversation in the car about
    just this issue. I say funny, because the same applies to (e.g.) archeology in
    the field and computer science (i.e. everywhere). If a university doesn&#39;t
    teach it&#39;s students the reasoning that went into boring stuff behind surveys
    and measuring, you&#39;re missing crucial background and context. However advanced
    your (GPS) technology, a basic mistake will be hard or impossible to diagnose
    and fix later.<br /><br />talking about older posts, head exploding programmer
    related basics :)<br />https://lwn.net/Articles/250967/<br />
