So nice to see you again ;)<br /><br />&quot;Why not deleting my inconvenient comment?&quot;<br /><br />I understand that everyone has their unique way of sharing their experience and accumulated wisdom, and giving back to the community that helped them grow. If this is the best way for you to create value, who am I to stop that?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I draw a big distinction on mlag types on whether you can operate/upgrade individual members independently or not (ie: shared control plane)<br /><br />If you intend to connect hosts with mlag as a redundancy measure, an mlag with a shared control place device that you can&#39;t do maintenance on individual devices like a 3850 stack is pointless and wasteful as you&#39;ll need to reboot the whole stack to upgrade.  Mlag on a 3850 stack is only useful as a mean to augment available bandwidth.  VSS is slightly better but not much.<br /><br />VPC on nx-os is better in that regard; control plane of the switches stay distinct and you can generally do maintenance including upgrades on one switch at a time while keeping one side of the mlag up all the time.  </div>

            <div class="comment-content">If I remember correctly using vPC requires the same code on both sides and if you are using FEX dual homed... Good luck (using FEX is dumb  it is just laziness )  You can try ISSU  but there are a lot of caveats with it (not from any version to any version, need to meet a lot of requirements) and it doesn&#39;t works all the time. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">They don&#39;t require the same version.<br />Also, we don&#39;t do dual homed FEXs; dual home fexs, as you state, lead to awful and useless complexity and brittleness. We dual home (lacp as much as possible) all our servers/hosts to single homed fex pairs.  As so we have a fairly plain topo that is resilient both for outages and maintenance and provides all active links... and thanks to the stability (or lack thereof...) of nx-is code (built in caps monkey as I call it) we get to test loss of a switch regularly without impact to the service (only the server admins notice they temporaires lost a server uplink)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Sneaking suspicion: the can of worms will contain L2 v.s. L3. While most MLAG implementations (including Cisco&#39;s vPC) will by now have fixed some of the &#39;interesting&#39; L3 issues that came with them, it&#39;s still best to view MLAG as tool for L2 architectures.<br />It is however perfectly feasible to design &amp; build a L3-only fabric, including redundant ToR/leaf switches and end host connectivity.<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">I would compare mlag with disk-raid systems. It&#39;s more about uptime and surviving single hardware failures  than anything else. As with raid the server/switch needs rebooting once in a while to upgrade but hopefully that may be done in scheduled service.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I know it&#39;s splitting hairs, but VSS is the acronym used to describe the cluster of switches where MEC (Multichassis EtherChannel) is the acronym used to actually describe a VSS MLAG.<br /><br />You can obfuscate the answer even more if you get into talking about chassis devices (i.e. Cisco 4500/6500/6800/9300, etc) that support multiple management cards (supervisor engines, route processors, what have you) and multiple interface line cards all within one chassis.</div>
