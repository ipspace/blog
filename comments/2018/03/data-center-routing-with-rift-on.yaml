    html: 'any link to the previous incarnation of the idea then? RPL is somewhat
      but very remotely related only. RIFT leans of course on many pieces that are
      well understood over years like ISIS-like-flooding &amp; will possibly pickup
      a thing from OLSR but many things like automatic dis-aggregation are AFAIK genuinely
      spanking new ... Steal &amp; borrow where you can and focus on solving the genuinely
      needed never-been-done pieces only ;-) '

    html: I asked a polar question but you answered with a counter question. So based
      on your explanation I guess now that rule 11 from RFC 1925 is applicable to
      RIFT.

    html: 'Hey Petr, we just released a binary package to give people a chance to
      play with the implementation<br /><br />https://www.juniper.net/us/en/dm/free-rift-trial/
      <br /><br />We hope it will lead to experimentation/feedback/demand/open-source
      attempts and detract a bit from the marketing and assumption-based discussions
      around things as of now ... And yes, open sourcing is a business decision which
      is not driven by techies and depend on many things. <br /><br />As to the chances
      of adoption, the properties of the protocol will speak for itself and with mild
      tongue in cheek let me quote B. Shaw: &quot;The reasonable man adapts himself
      to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to
      himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.&quot; I made
      a career of being the unreasonable man ;-)<br /><br />Look me up anytime for

    html: Don&#39;t beat around the bush. To me Petr&#39;s request was very clear.
      So will RIFT be open sourced? If you don&#39;t open source RIFT, it will be
      a non-starter.

    html: 'I believe that wide adoption is hardly possible without multiple, interoperating,
      and decent quality implementations. This is on top of benefits that people would
      gain with new protocol. <br /><br />For example, on the BGP story: when we tried
      using OSPF, we hit multiple issues in different vendors&#39; implementations.
      BGP just happened to be there and was implemented better, so we moved along
      with it, adapting the design. If, ISIS would have happened to be there across
      few vendors, things might have been very different. <br /><br />I totally understand
      that open-sourcing is not something you can solely decide on. I liked the Contrail
      approach, however ;)'

    html: Petr, yepp, I read you loud and clear. Let me ruminate just a bit (in multiple
      parts, I blew the 4096 characters ;-)<br /><br />I fully understand the OTT/hyperscaler
      situation and acknowledged fully in the podcast that IMO BGP happened for OTTs
      in a good part because there was better open source around (and BGP is easier
      to hack without breaking stuff ;-). And OTTs can pay the OPEX right now, point.
      And link-states are harder to build &amp; generally open source is so ho-hum
      only. However, they have nice properties and Open/R speaks for itself I guess
      ;-) And I don&#39;t hide the fact that some of the RIFT stuff was clearly inspired
      by the thinking/work you guys did there, it was a great thing someone who wasn&#39;t
      steeped in the 30 years of OSPF/ISIS dogma took a really fresh, hard look ;-)<br
      /><br />And seriously, I understand the open-source angle but here&#39;s a bunch
      observations from long, long, long experience where I helped tons open source
      things &amp; hacked on some &amp; saw very few succeed (Linux was notable, I
      happened to hide guys in IBM research and funnel money their way while they
      were skunking towards 0.9 version which was quite a no/no then ;-), Python,
      Django being another). For each of those  you have 10&#39;000s of abandoned
      low-quality construction pits and uncontrolled catfights like KVM vs. GNOME.
      <br /><br />a) So after years and years of &quot;open source&quot; we still
      don&#39;t have a really good link-state open source as you say. Reasons are
      manifold, one of them that scaling up link-state is really hard work people
      are not willing to do without making a living (and even if you try to explain
      to them how things need to be done to scale you end up being dismissed as irrelevant
      often, I have been down that curve, judged it a waste of time largely to be
      honest). And then it needs hard testing (testing costs tons of money as you
      know and no&#39;one in open source is much excited about that one).<br /><br

    html: 'b) Multiple interop&#39;ing implementations of routing protocols can happen
      without open source (we have 30 years of interoperable IETF routing protocols,
      mostly done by vendors long before open source was anything but Emacs and sendmail
      ;-), the really pivotal point is quality of the RFC and community, we&#39;re
      herding cats to get a good spec and get serious clue helping out with it. I
      think e.g. that model based packet formats will take lots of fragility/interop
      problems out of building RIFT and I&#39;m pushing on multiple fronts to bring
      IETF protocol building closer to how software is done today. I understand the
      release cycles stuff had is not what OTTs today are looking for and RIFT is
      one attempt to help us coping with this problem.  <br />c) Open source tends
      to attract attention and then too much of it only after something is &quot;hot&quot;.
      RIFT is not &quot;hot&quot; so I doubt I&#39;ll get tons of clueful, listening
      people willing to do the very hard work I would ask them to do (but I will of
      course get a lot of &quot;opinions&quot; ;-), lots of that work counter-intuitive
      but in case JNPR RIFT code goes open source we&#39;ll see how it plays out.
      Largely out my hand as I say being a techie and all and I&#39;m kind of agnostic
      really. <br />d) most important: leaf version is trivial and it was done very
      intentionally that way. RIFT allows to build a server/ToR version which is relatively
      simple (no southbound @ all, no disaggregation, only default route really &amp;
      so on). To the point it can be probably done in python ;-) There&#39;s tons
      of open source opportunity there which is however a different thing than &quot;free
      lunch&quot; ;-) BTW, I actually seen someone skunking something in one of the
      new half-scripting languages already but that petered out (as so often with
      open source, people get real jobs, loose interest, die on first hard hill &amp;
      then you&#39;re left with an open construction pit on github ;-)<br />e) even
      most important: if you play with the package we released you can trivially hook-up
      your implementation to it and interop, that&#39;s one of the main points of
      supporting that effort. <br /><br />So, in short, yeah, what we have may go
      open source, it may not, I doubt this is as important as you seem to think it
      is, someone with time &amp; dedication can get stuff going quickly by himself
      and we provide public package with a framework where interop testing of the
      control part against our stuff is trivial. If you run the package I released
      you see that you can converge a 30 or so switch CLOs with couple hundred prefixes
      in a second or so and look @ all the state.  <br /><br />Like I said, more of
      that best served with whiteboard and lunch ... <br />'

    html: 'I see OSS&#39;ing both as a marketing move and as a way to inject high
      quality &quot;seed&quot; implementation, which, as you mentioned, would be hard
      to bootstrap otherwise.  This increases chances of adoption, and piques interest
      of other vendors toward build their own implementation (or adopting existing
      OSS one).<br /><br />For example, take Arista, which has gained very strong
      footprint in DC. If you happened to have a quality OSS version, porting it to
      EOS would be trivial, and for Arista support cost would be just fixing possible
      SDK issues (though it&#39;s pretty stable now, albeit 32-bit). If some curious
      individual would write their RIFT implementation in scripting language (I did
      write bgp in python some time ago to bootstrap some things), the quality of
      said code is not likely be good enough for anyone to continue playing with.<br
      /><br />Additionally, let&#39;s imagine the RFC has been finalized (indeed,
      I find it well written, and not causing dizziness, unlike OSPF&#39;s). The incentive
      for someone else to build their own high-quality implementation would be still
      low, unless the new protocol offers amazing wins, that surpass by far any other
      routing protocol in existence (which, as we know, is unlikely possible). <br
      /><br />And yes, let&#39;s meet up if you want to discuss routing and things
      :) '

    html: Agreed with your take ;-) <br /><br />I do however think that RIFT implementations
      will materialize due to the OPEX pressure on building fabrics/DCs I see everywhere
      except top 7 OTT frankly, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have spent the time on spec&#39;ing
      it. If my assumption that &quot;CLOS fabric is the new RAM chip for bandwidth&quot;
      is wrong adoption will be lower. If DC fabrics move to something massively different
      than CLOs then new game will be afoot, the math plays for me and money burnt
      on hypercubes/torroidals that never delivered ;-) but massive amounts of money
      trying to find something better try to think whether a whole DC cannot be made
      a NUMA or even pure optical switching, I know ;-)  &quot;Plus ca change, plus
      ca reste meme&quot; however ;-) <br /><br />As to IETF/open-source, importance
      of it and so on, the 2nd most successful ever protocol to be deployed I think
      was EIGRP so that&#39;s a funny angle to think through. <br /><br />Pinged you
      on LinkedIn, if you willing let&#39;s move that to some nice food &amp; beer
      venue and exchange couple angles I don&#39;t want to spell out necessarily on
      this blog ;-) <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

  html: It would be super helpful to have RIFT&#39;s reference implementation open-sourced
    by Juniper (as I believe it to be high-quality). Otherwise, I feel the chances
    of getting wider adoption might be slim. I know it&#39;s a business decision in
    the end, but still :)

  html: 're: EIGRP<br />Only took Cisco 7 or 8 years to get that to work in the real
    world. The DUAL algorithm is real pretty on paper, but the reality was lot&#39;s
    of &quot;Stuck in Active&quot;. Stub and other things I don&#39;t recall finally
    tamped down the flooding issues, but it is still not a very scalable protocol
    for number of peers you can have. Other than flexible route summarization it isn&#39;t
    much better than OSPF.'
