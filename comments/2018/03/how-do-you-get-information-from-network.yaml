  html: 'If you don&#39;t want to use Ansible and / or Python expect might be a solution.
    Maybe expect wrapped into a tool like RANCID (which itself is written in a mixture
    of Shell, AWK, Perl and expect). <br /><br />Example: /usr/libexec/rancid/clogin
    -c &quot;sh ver&quot; router.example.com <br /><br />(clogin is part of rancid
    and takes care of logging into Cisco devices, there are several other variants
    like jlogin for Juniper, ...)<br /><br />The output can be parsed using the *NIX
    shell. Or Perl, Python, Ruby, ...<br /><br />My advice: If you don&#39;t have
    rancid running and you are not familiar with the *NIX shell learn Ansible and
    Python. <br /><br />https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/expect<br
    />http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/<br /><br />P.S. I know that people will be
    throwing stones at me for this comment'

  html: '&quot;I know that people will be throwing stones at me for this comment&quot;
    &lt;&lt; FWIW, I totally agree with you... and if such stones would be real, I
    could build a nice palace out of everything I received in the past, mostly from
    anonymous donors.'

  html: "As far as I know Ansible doesn\u2019t support logging in via telnet. <br\
    \ />So if I need some automation for a bunch of outdated cisco ISRs I still use\
    \ Rancid without a hesitation "

  html: 'If your vendor can&#39;t get their CLI to provide useful info then I wouldn&#39;t
    put much faith in their API for data.  In that case consider wrapping some snmpwalks
    inside a .sh -- and then wrap that inside a .py for good measure -- the outer
    .py will be a shield to help you weather the #netdevops hype storm which will
    last a few more years. <br />At least then your python box is checked :) '
