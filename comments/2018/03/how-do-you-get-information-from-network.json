      "html": "If you don&#39;t want to use Ansible and / or Python expect might be a solution. Maybe expect wrapped into a tool like RANCID (which itself is written in a mixture of Shell, AWK, Perl and expect). <br /><br />Example: /usr/libexec/rancid/clogin -c &quot;sh ver&quot; router.example.com <br /><br />(clogin is part of rancid and takes care of logging into Cisco devices, there are several other variants like jlogin for Juniper, ...)<br /><br />The output can be parsed using the *NIX shell. Or Perl, Python, Ruby, ...<br /><br />My advice: If you don&#39;t have rancid running and you are not familiar with the *NIX shell learn Ansible and Python. <br /><br />https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/expect<br />http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/<br /><br />P.S. I know that people will be throwing stones at me for this comment",

In that case consider wrapping some snmpwalks inside a .sh -- and then wrap that inside a .py for good measure -- the outer .py will be a shield to help you weather the #netdevops hype storm which will last a few more years. <br />At least then your python box is checked :) ",
