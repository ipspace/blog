  html: Whether it&#39;s VXLAN (probably BGP EVPN) or VPLS (probably Kompella) or
    PBB or what have you, you still suffer the full mesh scale problem. In my opinion
    you can&#39;t fix that with a route server because it would become the central
    chokepoint. Especially with 1 Terabit/s links.

    html: VPLS - agreed, many.<br /><br />VXLAN - would love to hear about more of
      them. Any pointers you can share?

    html: 'So it&#39;s time to create some value for the community. I just did a 5
      minutes Google research. INEX migrated to VXLAN, see here: http://docs.ixpmanager.org/features/layer2-addresses/
      . They also created a so called IXP Manager with Saltstack (NAPALM) and it has
      also a nice Web GUI https://www.ixpmanager.org/media/2017/201709-nlnog2017-automation-with-ixp-manager.pdf.
      So we can now create our won IXP.'

  html: The premise here is not correct, most large IXP operators have deployed VXLAN
    or VPLS for their Layer-2 domain already. EVPN may be in use in newer IXPs as
    well but I haven&#39;t seen any specific cases of this myself.

      long-distance IXPs make little sense.

  html: LONAP CTO here!<br /><br />We&#39;re a mid-sized IXP (~200 networks connected,
    ~3Tbit connected capacity) who have been running VXLAN on Arista for around two
    years now, with great results. This is in a &#39;flood and learn&#39; config with
    Head-End-Replication (HER) - i.e we are replicating BUM at the edge to all other
    edge nodes. We are doing some testing with EVPN-on-VXLAN although it is worth
    noting it doesn&#39;t have some of the compelling advantages for an IXP as it
    does for a L2/L3 datacentre network. <br /><br />Our friends over at INEX are
    in a similar setup for their primary LAN, which I think they deployed during 2017.<br
    /><br />We started down this road in mid-2015 after a failed deployment of VPLS/MPLS
    with another vendor, and it swiftly became clear that a &#39;datacentre class&#39;
    leaf-spine architecture with something like VXLAN was the way to go for a growing
    IXP of our size. ECMP has let us scale easily from n*10G to n*100G in the core
    and with VXLAN, the imposition of entropy on the source UDP port means intermediate
    network elements can effectively loadbalance the traffic. <br /><br />As regards
    the topic of large l2 networks &#39;spanning the globe&#39;, I think we need to
    take a step back from technology and look at human and commercial factors. By
    far the most popular model for IXP charging is a low flat-rate per-port model.
    It is more difficult to keep a control on costs if you have expensive leased capacity
    there, which is why successful IXPs keep to the metro where they can scale easily
    and avoid competing with their own members. <br /><br />Moreover there is an expectation
    among network operators that the endpoint of their BGP session across the fabric
    is relatively nearby. Long-stretched L2 domains are unpopular among many as they
    mess up this assumption, cause hairpinning and thus bad enduser experience. There
    is a role for stretched IXP model - i.e. &#39;reseller&#39; programs and the like,
    under controlled conditions. But most operators prefer to meet over a fast, local
    fabric in the metro. <br /><br />LONAP in her 21 years of existence has seen many
    such &#39;global IX&#39; operators come and go. :)

    html: 'Exactly those reasons lead us to build SIX.SK on top of TRILL back in 2014.
      Simple, straightforward and stable for almost 4 years. One bonus point - BUM
      traffic is in TRILL distributed natively, without the need for central replication. '

  html: vxlan generally works better for ixps than vpls. There are some major wins
    in terms of compexity reduction, including no requirement for lsp management and
    out-of-the-box load-balancing over parallel links in the ixp core. This is messy
    to handle in vpls because most silicon out there won&#39;t inspect L4 headers
    when creating n-tuple hashes for load-balancing. So you end up either having to
    use expensive hardware or else building multiple lsps between each PE, with traffic
    load-balanced by the PE on a per-LSP basis. This doesn&#39;t scale well because
    you end up with O(PE^2) LSPs on your network<br /><br />EVPN control plane for
    vxlan isn&#39;t ready for production networks yet.  Hopefully soon.
