  html: Great summary and reasons for Telemetry instead of polling. This powerful
    MDT has to be supplemented by visualization and query tools to make best use of
    the data. This is where intent-driven assurance systems play a vital role. Operators
    need a flexible interface to express their requirements which includes conditions
    &amp; actions and the software has to perform the heavy lifting of processing
    telemetry data at acceptable throughput.

  html: Good overview. I am working on trying to show the value in telemetry to a
    group that only knows SNMP.
