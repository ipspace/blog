I assume this would be on a small scale only. Once you get to 5 or 10 or more sites, routed MPLS VPN is really the only solution that will scale... (May be I am missing the context).",

      "html": "So Ivan, you are telling me to go back to the old days of overlay networks over ATM/Frame relay, now revisited over IP/MPLS ? Seriuos ISPs have today thousands and thousands of customers well satisfied with L3VPN services, and as far as is my understanding, L2 services are a small percentage of overall BGP/MPLS services. But to be sincere my point in the past comment was about Data center scenarios. My point was that you can drastically simplify the fabric deploying multitenancy through simple L3VPN, without using LDP, but using simple MPLS over GR/IP/UDP+IP. And therefore you do not need neither EVPN nor VXLAN (I understand that this is blasphemous ... !!!)",

We have looked into buying layer 3 VPN services several times, but always decide against because we&#39;d have to integrate with the service provider&#39;s routing (which would limit our flexibility, sometimes limit our choice of IP ranges, sometimes just not work with IPv6, and most importantly based on experience I don&#39;t trust our service provider to handle routing properly...)",

Gone is the curious, extroverted, inner geek, who weighed up his career options as a project engineer or a support analyst and decided that support was probably the perfect combination of people+tech.<br /><br />In his/her place, we have state sponsored employee numbers with designations that bear no resemblance to the geek-come-customer-champion of yesteryear. IT jobs FTW?<br /><br />&quot;Fill those seats and get them filled ASAP or you can kiss goodbye to the second, third and fourth stages of that grant we promised!&quot;<br /><br />Applying a cattle prod to your country&#39;s employment statistics is a brilliant short term win. Everyone&#39;s a winner!<br /> <br />Is this really true, though?<br /><br />It&#39;s possible that such endeavours could jumpstart someone&#39;s ascent on the Needs Hierarchy and in turn, propel a nation out of stagnation... but is it enough to merely set the wheels in motion?<br /><br />Yeh, course. Just like when you plug cables into any port of any switch, all of your apps come alive, magically. <br /><br />In such a state (demoralised, depressed, angry, resentful, unproductive - pick one? :P) how likely are people to welcome additional complexity into their lives? Is it, perhaps, more likely they&#39;ll stick to what they know?<br /><br />24 bit masks?<br />The ARP cache?<br /><br />Who knows! :)",
