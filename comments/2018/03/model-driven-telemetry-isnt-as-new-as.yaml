    html: Worse still the Yang schema (carried over netconf) for XE is different to
      XR. If there was ever a protocol/language that should have resolved the issues
      around OS compatibility within the same vendor, Netconf Yang is what should
      have addressed this. As a customer I&#39;d recommend you message that to your
      Cisco points of contact and the wider industry because it won&#39;t get fixed
      until people escalate.<br /><br />There are reasons this happens and there are
      also reasons it should not happen.

    html: NETCONF on XE got much better in the meantime as they ported Tail-f&#39;s
      confd to IOS XE.<br /><br />http://blog.ipspace.net/2017/04/netconf-agents-on-cisco-ios-xe-16x.html<br
      /><br />Still not much better than lipstick on a pig; for example, there&#39;s
      no candidate config and commit because you cannot get that done on IOS at all.<br

  html: In regards to &quot;Cisco IOS XE supports NETCONF now&quot;, have there been
    any recent developments around that? Last time I looked at Netconf on XE, it was
    pathetically incomplete - dumb things like getting completely unstructured config
    text back when requesting the configuration. But it has been a couple of years.
    At the time, it felt very much like cisco needed to check a &quot;supports NETCONF&quot;
    box in an RFP, so they threw together the bare minimum function and called it
    good.

  html: Whilst I don&#39;t disagree with your statements on old vs new regarding telemetry.
    I think it&#39;s worth pointing out that Telemetry is a publisher &amp; subscriber
    model. What that means for the average Joe is that you don&#39;t need to configure
    the device for each mib feature, you ask it via API to send specific or generic
    feeds on events/ data. Now that also is not that new, but what does change is
    the need for essentially a telemetry proxy / cache. Whilst traditional SNMP trap
    or Netflow feeds limit the number of destination targets, telemetry does not.
    There will normally be multiple subscribers to the same telemetry data. And this
    could result in race conditions. I think the next big change you&#39;ll see messaged
    in this area is the move to a central cluster of telemetry cache systems. Kafka
    is one example of these. The main point being the systems using telemetry wont
    subscribe direct to the device they&#39;ll need to request it via the proxy/gateway.
    This is something all the vendors are still coming to terms with. It may also
    unfortunately result in periods of vendors lock in until the market forces better
    standards and the standards groups start to catch up on the industry. One of the
    great things about SNMP and other legacy MANO protocols is they have a reasonable
    level of software neutrality. That won&#39;t be the case for a while in the telemetry
    world.<br />I&#39;d also point out that the server and platform SaaS vendors have
    been doing telemetry for years...nee gRPC Openconfig. The network industry is
    in catch-up mode and not really seeing customers flex their muscle with requests
    to conform to more generic telemetry capture tools and standards.<br />

  html: 'The word &quot;telemetry&quot; inherently means a push or streaming model
    of delivery instead of polling.  Most already realize &quot;model-driven&quot;
    isn&#39;t new, like you said SNMP has been using data model structures for 20+
    years.  It&#39;s the &quot;telemetry&quot; portion of &quot;Model-Driven Telemetry&quot;
    or &quot;Juniper Telemetry Interface&quot; that&#39;s important and new.  Of course
    that word risks the same kind of vague definitions and dilution of meaning as
    &quot;sdn&quot; and &quot;cloud&quot; before it.  <br /><br />The gNMI spec covers
    a standard encoding method, at least when using GPB for telemetry data. Vendors
    are working on implementing that now and at least we may have a key/value format
    that is standard across vendors even if the paths and values are not.  Standard
    models like OC or IETF solve some of those issues where possible.  '

  html: People disregards SNMP trap and only comparing between SNMP polling versus
    telemetry.<br /><br />it needs to define more comparison between two protocol
    types rather than push versus poll.<br /><br />SNMP trap is pushing mechansim
    so really it confuses people this way.
