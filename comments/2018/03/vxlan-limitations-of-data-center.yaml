    html: '&quot;True, every $vendor (you should Trademark this one Ivan) &quot; &lt;&lt;
      I should have trademarked &quot;BUM frames&quot; ;)<br /><br />I remember a
      vendor having 256 VLANs in total with custom ASICs. And no, it was not in the
      90s ;))'

  html: True, every $vendor (you should Trademark this one Ivan) using a white box
    switch based on BRCM chips will hit that issue, which is not an issue by the way.
    But I remember other vendors having the same limitations with custom ASICs. We
    don&#39;t have infinite table sizes... Some chips are now programmable, you may
    want to look at what they can offer if you still want to have 300 VLANs on all
    server-facing ports. Debug, debug...

    html: 'It&#39;s not the problem of 24-bit address space, it&#39;s the question
      of how many L2 segments an individual switch can handle. Obviously you can use
      different VNIs on different switches.<br /><br />Orchestration and management:

    html: Speaking of VM tracker on nx-os, I know I mentioned its existence to you
      during a webinar, but after experimenting with it, the feature is pretty limited
      (can only be enabled globally on all turnk ports, can&#39;t configure a set
      of always trunked vlans, for your esx vmknics for example...) and seems to be
      almost orphaned within Bu/TAC (no one really knows about it)... gave up on using
      it...

  html: "&quot;Expect to see similar limitations in most other chipsets. There\u2019\
    s a huge gap between millions of segments enabled by 24-bit VXLAN Network Identifier\
    \ and reality of switching silicon. Most switching hardware is also limited to\
    \ 4K VLANs&quot;<br /><br />If tenant VLAN tag is not carried in VxLAN encapsulated\
    \ packet it is possible to use the 24 bit address space across the DC network.AFAIk\
    \ some implementations support excluding the VLAN tag.<br /><br />Orchestration\
    \ and management of this network becomes tricky. Thoughts?"
