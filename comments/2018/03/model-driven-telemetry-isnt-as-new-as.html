            <div class="comment-content">In regards to &quot;Cisco IOS XE supports NETCONF now&quot;, have there been any recent developments around that? Last time I looked at Netconf on XE, it was pathetically incomplete - dumb things like getting completely unstructured config text back when requesting the configuration. But it has been a couple of years. At the time, it felt very much like cisco needed to check a &quot;supports NETCONF&quot; box in an RFP, so they threw together the bare minimum function and called it good.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Worse still the Yang schema (carried over netconf) for XE is different to XR. If there was ever a protocol/language that should have resolved the issues around OS compatibility within the same vendor, Netconf Yang is what should have addressed this. As a customer I&#39;d recommend you message that to your Cisco points of contact and the wider industry because it won&#39;t get fixed until people escalate.<br /><br />There are reasons this happens and there are also reasons it should not happen.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">NETCONF on XE got much better in the meantime as they ported Tail-f&#39;s confd to IOS XE.<br /><br />http://blog.ipspace.net/2017/04/netconf-agents-on-cisco-ios-xe-16x.html<br /><br />Still not much better than lipstick on a pig; for example, there&#39;s no candidate config and commit because you cannot get that done on IOS at all.<br /><br />http://blog.ipspace.net/2017/03/netconf-transactional-consistency-on.html<br /><br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">Whilst I don&#39;t disagree with your statements on old vs new regarding telemetry. I think it&#39;s worth pointing out that Telemetry is a publisher &amp; subscriber model. What that means for the average Joe is that you don&#39;t need to configure the device for each mib feature, you ask it via API to send specific or generic feeds on events/ data. Now that also is not that new, but what does change is the need for essentially a telemetry proxy / cache. Whilst traditional SNMP trap or Netflow feeds limit the number of destination targets, telemetry does not. There will normally be multiple subscribers to the same telemetry data. And this could result in race conditions. I think the next big change you&#39;ll see messaged in this area is the move to a central cluster of telemetry cache systems. Kafka is one example of these. The main point being the systems using telemetry wont subscribe direct to the device they&#39;ll need to request it via the proxy/gateway. This is something all the vendors are still coming to terms with. It may also unfortunately result in periods of vendors lock in until the market forces better standards and the standards groups start to catch up on the industry. One of the great things about SNMP and other legacy MANO protocols is they have a reasonable level of software neutrality. That won&#39;t be the case for a while in the telemetry world.<br />I&#39;d also point out that the server and platform SaaS vendors have been doing telemetry for years...nee gRPC Openconfig. The network industry is in catch-up mode and not really seeing customers flex their muscle with requests to conform to more generic telemetry capture tools and standards.<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">The word &quot;telemetry&quot; inherently means a push or streaming model of delivery instead of polling.  Most already realize &quot;model-driven&quot; isn&#39;t new, like you said SNMP has been using data model structures for 20+ years.  It&#39;s the &quot;telemetry&quot; portion of &quot;Model-Driven Telemetry&quot; or &quot;Juniper Telemetry Interface&quot; that&#39;s important and new.  Of course that word risks the same kind of vague definitions and dilution of meaning as &quot;sdn&quot; and &quot;cloud&quot; before it.  <br /><br />The gNMI spec covers a standard encoding method, at least when using GPB for telemetry data. Vendors are working on implementing that now and at least we may have a key/value format that is standard across vendors even if the paths and values are not.  Standard models like OC or IETF solve some of those issues where possible.  </div>
