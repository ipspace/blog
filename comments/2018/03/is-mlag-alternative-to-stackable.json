We dual home (lacp as much as possible) all our servers/hosts to single homed fex pairs.  As so we have a fairly plain topo that is resilient both for outages and maintenance and provides all active links... and thanks to the stability (or lack thereof...) of nx-is code (built in caps monkey as I call it) we get to test loss of a switch regularly without impact to the service (only the server admins notice they temporaires lost a server uplink)",

Mlag on a 3850 stack is only useful as a mean to augment available bandwidth.  VSS is slightly better but not much.<br /><br />VPC on nx-os is better in that regard; control plane of the switches stay distinct and you can generally do maintenance including upgrades on one switch at a time while keeping one side of the mlag up all the time.
