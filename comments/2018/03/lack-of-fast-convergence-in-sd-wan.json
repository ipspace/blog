      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I can only answer for IWAN and Viptela as those are the solutions I have experience with. Those are the two with the strongest routing stack naturally since Cisco has done routing for some time now... And Viptela was founded by ex Cisco employees with strong background in routing and large scale networking.<br /><br />Viptela runs BFD on the overlay while IWAN doesn&#39;t. However, you&#39;re not dependent on BGP to failover traffic when there is a failure. With IWAN there is channels per transport, destination site and DSCP that measure performance. If a channel becomes unreachable then that transport is not used any longer. This takes 4s normally but can be tuned to 1s if needed, for example for voice traffic. For &quot;soft&quot; failures such as packet loss and increase in latency, this is normally acted upon after about 30s.<br /><br />I know some of the SD-WAN vendors use another approach to make sure voice packets arrive. They send the packets out both transport with some form of sequence number and then put the stream back at the other end. Deja vu to LFI? At least there is some resemblance. In theory this doesn&#39;t sound like the best idea but I&#39;ve heard people having positive results with it especially on &quot;wonky&quot; circuits where you expect latency, packet lsos etc (think satellite links).<br /><br />Any SD-WAN vendor should have a good routing stack though. Some of the companies came from the WAN acceleration market though so they have no strong background in routing.<br /><br />Good post as always!",

Why would anyone want a greenfield Viptela on ISR deployment if x86 is 1/3 or 1/4 the cost?  What if Cisco instead atoned for IWAN by offering current IWAN customers with free/cheap x86 branch hardware while Viptela engineering resources were laser focused on improving their SD-WAN capabilities on native x86?",

So your voice calls will remain crisp and clear..",

This deficiency means that even with tight timers (1/3?) in certain failure or upgrade scenarios there will be a noticeable outage.<br /><br />Regarding the hidden documentation, do you really believe that a competitor is incapable of registering with a personal/fake email address and gaining access to all the docs?  If this isn&#39;t an effective solution for preventing competitors from snooping, then stop using it!  It does more harm for potential customers than anything else.",

      "html": "VMware NSX SD-WAN/VeloCloud embeds probe packets within overlay paths sent every 100ms and will select an alternate path if required in 300-500ms.  It can leverage tight timers on the LAN side with BGP and OSPF if required.  Also uses FEC and NACK to overcome lossy paths.  HA failover and clustering are options between CPE.  We have dozens of customers with hundreds of sites deployed and I can definitively state, we have designed much more fault tolerant and faster converging designs than we were ever able to with traditional routers and routing protocols.<br /><br />Publicly publishing technical docs would be great but in the extremely competitive SD-WAN market, all of the players are keeping their &quot;secret sauce&quot; hidden away.
