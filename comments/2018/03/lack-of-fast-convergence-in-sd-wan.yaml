    html: There&#39;s convergence _WITHIN_ the SD-WAN cloud and convergence at the
      _EDGE_ of the SD-WAN cloud (with external devices). This blog post discusses
      the latter.<br /><br />And yes, I&#39;m pretty sure Viptela has something at
      the edge, but as they&#39;re still hiding their documentation I don&#39;t care
      much about what they&#39;re doing.<br /><br />IWAN definitely does have decent
      routing protocols at the edge (after all, it&#39;s just Cisco IOS), but is it
      really SD-WAN?

    html: I see. I thought your reader was discussing BGP for the overlay.<br /><br
      />Defining SD-WAN is probably as meaningful as defining SDN. IWAN does have
      more &quot;intelligence&quot; than traditional routing protocols. If it ticks
      one&#39;s check boxes to be SD-WAN is up to each person imo.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I can only answer for IWAN and Viptela as those are the
    solutions I have experience with. Those are the two with the strongest routing
    stack naturally since Cisco has done routing for some time now... And Viptela
    was founded by ex Cisco employees with strong background in routing and large
    scale networking.<br /><br />Viptela runs BFD on the overlay while IWAN doesn&#39;t.
    However, you&#39;re not dependent on BGP to failover traffic when there is a failure.
    With IWAN there is channels per transport, destination site and DSCP that measure
    performance. If a channel becomes unreachable then that transport is not used
    any longer. This takes 4s normally but can be tuned to 1s if needed, for example
    for voice traffic. For &quot;soft&quot; failures such as packet loss and increase
    in latency, this is normally acted upon after about 30s.<br /><br />I know some
    of the SD-WAN vendors use another approach to make sure voice packets arrive.
    They send the packets out both transport with some form of sequence number and
    then put the stream back at the other end. Deja vu to LFI? At least there is some
    resemblance. In theory this doesn&#39;t sound like the best idea but I&#39;ve
    heard people having positive results with it especially on &quot;wonky&quot; circuits
    where you expect latency, packet lsos etc (think satellite links).<br /><br />Any
    SD-WAN vendor should have a good routing stack though. Some of the companies came
    from the WAN acceleration market though so they have no strong background in routing.<br
    /><br />Good post as always!

    html: Dear Unknown,<br /><br />As I already mentioned, Cisco SD-WAN (assuming
      you mean Viptela) has no public documentation, so I can&#39;t consider what
      it may or may not do. The moment their documentation is made public you&#39;re
      most welcome to add another comment telling me so.

    html: If I&#39;m reading your blog and looking for insight into SD-WAN, I would
      expect you to have some real world experience with the technology and the limitations
      of the top 2-3 solutions before writing a blog post on the subject.  Viptela
      is one of the lead SD-WAN vendors in the market. To ignore the distinct advantages
      of that solution seems strange...

    html: '&quot;Unknown&quot;, please double-check your information:<br />1.) iWAN
      is PfR with lipstick (not SD-WAN)<br />2.) Viptela supports BFD within the SD-WAN
      cloud but does NOT support BFD on the LAN facing side (edge of the SD-WAN cloud).  Big
      difference.<br />3.) Since Viptela is spending a bunch of their dev resources
      porting their product to non-x86 legacy ISR platforms it may be quite some time
      before this is resolved.<br />'

      Viptela looks cool (certainly not a hater), but porting Viptela to ISR seems
      like an expensive way to pacify existing IWAN customers.  Why would anyone want
      a greenfield Viptela on ISR deployment if x86 is 1/3 or 1/4 the cost?  What
      if Cisco instead atoned for IWAN by offering current IWAN customers with free/cheap
      x86 branch hardware while Viptela engineering resources were laser focused on
      improving their SD-WAN capabilities on native x86?'

    html: You would be suprised how many folks cannot get Ethernet service without
      spending a ton of money for build out.  Legacy connectivity and interface modularity
      is sitll a requirement.  You would also be suprised how many people are still
      reliant on voice services on the router.  <br /><br />I believe all of the excitement
      around SD-WAN made people forget the reasons for the INTEGRATED Services Router.  Porting
      Viptela capabilities to IOS-XE and the existing ISR 4K user base is a no brainer.  Gotta
      bring the Cisco family that has invested in the 4K hardware along for the ride!

  html: 'VMware NSX SD-WAN/VeloCloud embeds probe packets within overlay paths sent
    every 100ms and will select an alternate path if required in 300-500ms.  It can
    leverage tight timers on the LAN side with BGP and OSPF if required.  Also uses
    FEC and NACK to overcome lossy paths.  HA failover and clustering are options
    between CPE.  We have dozens of customers with hundreds of sites deployed and
    I can definitively state, we have designed much more fault tolerant and faster
    converging designs than we were ever able to with traditional routers and routing
    protocols.<br /><br />Publicly publishing technical docs would be great but in
    the extremely competitive SD-WAN market, all of the players are keeping their
    &quot;secret sauce&quot; hidden away.    '
