But I remember other vendors having the same limitations with custom ASICs. We don&#39;t have infinite table sizes... Some chips are now programmable, you may want to look at what they can offer if you still want to have 300 VLANs on all server-facing ports. Debug, debug...",

      "html": "&quot;Expect to see similar limitations in most other chipsets. There\u2019s a huge gap between millions of segments enabled by 24-bit VXLAN Network Identifier and reality of switching silicon. Most switching hardware is also limited to 4K VLANs&quot;<br /><br />If tenant VLAN tag is not carried in VxLAN encapsulated packet it is possible to use the 24 bit address space across the DC network.AFAIk some implementations support excluding the VLAN tag.<br /><br />Orchestration and management of this network becomes tricky.
