Ansible sometimes feels like micromanagement gone wrong ;) We managed to squeeze a lot out of it in the network automation online course (including a lot of things you mentioned), but it definitely is a very low level tool. If you want to know more, contact me via email.<br /><br />Haven&#39;t seen anything better (yet) apart from high-end stuff like Cisco NSO, or potentially Apstra AOS (although that one still has ways to go).<br /><br />@Anonymous: as much as I love Terraform &amp;co, and it&#39;s great for deploying full-blown application stacks, it doesn&#39;t solve provisioning of traditional network services (think L2VPN or L3VPN).",

      "html": "Hi,<br />  The Apstra demo&#39;s look really cool. There seem to be nice blueprints available for a variety of scenarios in their GUI. However it looks like they will loose this edge if they interface with OpenStack/NSX Controller, as the GUI will be taken care by OpenStack/NSX. Is this a fair comment?<br /><br />Also do you think it will be reasonable to assume that there will be multiple configurations screens which operators/administrators will use? Use the existing tools for Compute/Storage and move to Apstra for network. <br /><br />Please let me know<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Arvind",
