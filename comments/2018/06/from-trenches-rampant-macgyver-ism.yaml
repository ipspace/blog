  html: You all are only looking for excuses to hide from automation. Just do it.
    Start small and than tackle the bigger challanges. Snowflakes are just job savers.
    You have to fire the designer of the snowflake to solve the problem. There is
    no other possibility.

    html: Haha... I like Cisco as a company... We complain about it, but compared
      to many other industries, it&#39;s definitely not a bad market leader. But this
      comment is funny and profoundly true!

    html: We as networkers should look at what happened in the world of software in
      the last years.  Networking is walking the same path with a few years of delay,
      mostly because hardware lifecycle makes harder to throw away the old heavy stuff
      - but I&#39;m not assuming that replacing old code is easier.<br /><br />http://philosopherdeveloper.com/posts/hero-culture-vs-borg-culture.html<br
      /><br />We shouls learn from the history and be prepared for what will come
      next.

    html: Recently it&#39;s pretty hard to distinguish anonymous trolling from (some)
      valid comments coming from the &quot;same&quot; source. Maybe if some anonymous
      commenters would stop behaving like frustrated kids we could have a decent discussion.<br
      /><br />Alternatively, you could start using your real name... Nah, not likely.

  html: 'The network space has a lot of amateur snowflake builders. You need to work
    in systems engineering to build the ultimate snowflake... so beautiful and incredibly
    fragile. Even better, there are numerous configuration (so called orchestration)
    tools to pretend as though you are building something to stand the test of time.
    Hopefully, networking can avoid this in the long run. '
