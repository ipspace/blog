          "html": "As @Mikhail pointed out, price tag is a business requirement. The budget the business is willing to invest into the critical infrastructure that runs the business is a business requirement. If you can&#39;t persuade the budget owners that your solution is worth their budget you have an obvious problem... and it&#39;s not technical.<br /><br />For example, &quot;redundant WAN links&quot; is not a business requirement. It&#39;s a means to an end, and may or may not be justified based on what the real business requirements are.<br /><br />Then there&#39;s the &quot;negotiation&quot; phase - based on business requirement you come up with a solution. They balk at the price tag. No problem - you can change the solution **when they adjust the requirements**.<br /><br />Now, all this works in imaginary world (at least for Grumpy Anonymous) where the motivation of the network architect is aligned with the motivation of the business (getting the most bang for the buck). If you allow a vendor to design your network, you get the price tag you deserve. Worst example I&#39;ve seen: non-redundant Nexus 7000 (because there was no budget for two of them) acting as a ridiculously-expensive patch panel. <br /><br />That&#39;s why some customers go for independent consultant and/or design reviews. I understand that not everyone believes in the feasibility of this approach. I have no problem with non-believers, we&#39;re too busy working with people who see value in what we do.<br /><br />Finally, there are the customers going for the cheapest. We had a few of them in the past, thanked them for their interest, and moved on. They&#39;re a waste of everyone&#39;s time.",
