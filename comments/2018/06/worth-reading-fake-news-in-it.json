Someone&#39;s web site is not a public property like Hyde Park corner where you could do anything you feel like (well, not even there, but that&#39;s another story).<br /><br />If you come visit me (hiding under a mask) and start littering or spraying graffiti all over the place, I&#39;ll kick you out. You&#39;re a guest, and I expect you to behave. Plain and simple. Censorship has nothing to do with it - nobody is telling you you can&#39;t spread your views on your own web site or anywhere else you wish.",
