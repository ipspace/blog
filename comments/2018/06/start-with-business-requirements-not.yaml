    html: 'Have to agree with @Anonymous.<br /><br />The architecture is often driven
      by the Excel sheet. Seen this many times: the product is selected first because
      it simply matches the budget and we (designers &amp; architects) are required
      to implement the solution matching original requirements.<br /><br />Worked
      for many big projects both for US-based and EU-based companies. I am talking
      about non-military projects - those strictly driven by business case.<br /><br
      />I wonder if someone lives in &#39;ideal&#39; world (the one from the books).'

    html: price is a business requirement too.<br />Customer will not choose overengineered
      solution against business requirements.<br />For example technically it is good
      to have redundancy. But if RTO is large enough customer will never pay for redundancy

    html: When you cooperate with the design &amp; requirements with big vendors very
      often you are &quot;suggested&quot; to use specific hardware (as a part of the
      vendor strategy) regardless of the real needs here.<br />You are &quot;encouraged&quot;
      by the better discounts to promote certain solutions.<br /><br />I do not want
      to share any further details (vendor names, project names) - I took part in
      many big deals and believe me - the reality is far from the ideal imagination.

    html: 'As @Mikhail pointed out, price tag is a business requirement. The budget
      the business is willing to invest into the critical infrastructure that runs
      the business is a business requirement. If you can&#39;t persuade the budget
      owners that your solution is worth their budget you have an obvious problem...
      and it&#39;s not technical.<br /><br />For example, &quot;redundant WAN links&quot;
      is not a business requirement. It&#39;s a means to an end, and may or may not
      be justified based on what the real business requirements are.<br /><br />Then
      there&#39;s the &quot;negotiation&quot; phase - based on business requirement
      you come up with a solution. They balk at the price tag. No problem - you can
      change the solution **when they adjust the requirements**.<br /><br />Now, all
      this works in imaginary world (at least for Grumpy Anonymous) where the motivation
      of the network architect is aligned with the motivation of the business (getting
      the most bang for the buck). If you allow a vendor to design your network, you
      get the price tag you deserve. Worst example I&#39;ve seen: non-redundant Nexus
      7000 (because there was no budget for two of them) acting as a ridiculously-expensive
      patch panel. <br /><br />That&#39;s why some customers go for independent consultant
      and/or design reviews. I understand that not everyone believes in the feasibility
      of this approach. I have no problem with non-believers, we&#39;re too busy working
      with people who see value in what we do.<br /><br />Finally, there are the customers
      going for the cheapest. We had a few of them in the past, thanked them for their
      interest, and moved on. They&#39;re a waste of everyone&#39;s time.'

    html: '&#39;When&#39; is a conditional and nothing more. That&#39;s probably why
      you became a consultant so you don&#39;t have to literally deal with the budget
      owners anymore. It seems you were absent from reality for too long. The management
      decides to introduce the next big bang (it has to be at least as nice as AWS).
      If you can&#39;t deliver in budget and time you know where the door is. They
      give a damn about your art of persuasion. And now tell me another fairy tale.'

    html: 'OK, so you&#39;re not invited to the table when decisions are made, and

      doing (according to your opinion). Welcome to the real world. <br /><br />Have

  html: Your business requirements are all fine and dandy until the responsibles see
    the price tag. Suddenly they forget about the requirements and go with the cheapest.
    The requirements are only worth the paper it&#39;s written on. I don&#39;t know
    in which world you live in.

    html: I feel sympathy with you, namesake. They probably ask if they could do the
      same things as with AWS because they like it that way. Welcome to the beautiful
      new world of human stupidity. The only possibility to remedy is to take the
      red pill.

    html: Yeah, been there, seen that. Even worse, I&#39;ve seen very smart teams
      (who honestly try to do everything right) start at infrastructure instead of
      how they&#39;ll deliver the services to the business.<br /><br />Not new either
      (as in &quot;stupidity and universe are infinite... well, we&#39;re not sure
      about the universe&quot;). 20+ years ago had to deal with the aftermath of someone
      selling a customer a bunch of totally unnecessary Stratacom switches because
      everyone knows you need ATM to run MPLS.<br /><br />BTW, you might enjoy this

    html: Really great example with Deutsche Telekom. They stick with Openstack and
      Huawei but nobody cares. Customers ask if they could to do the same thing as
      with AWS (you can guess the answer). The only unique selling point maybe data
      location but that&#39;s also gone. So they partner now with Microsoft because
      they can&#39;t beat them. Open Telekom Cloud is a lead balloon.

  html: One of my colleagues purchased VMware vSphere licenses with NSX bundle, which
    was promoted by some external licenses. Now they ask me whether they can do X,
    Y and Z with it... Strange world we live in...
