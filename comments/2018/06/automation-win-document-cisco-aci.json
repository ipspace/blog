          "html": "I have been involved in system automation for 13+ years (Data Models, Templates, etc) and I am a little bit bored by all those discoveries &amp; achievements in this area we see in last few years.<br /><br />When I started doing automation in 2005 the only questions we were asked: does it make any economic sense? If yes, then automate. No special philosophy involved, just pure economy.<br /><br />I want to say: if the automation is really needed people will follow this path. <br />",

          "html": "@Gogus: I could take the same approach. I could say &quot;we had automation in 1993, so it&#39;s nothing new, let&#39;s move on&quot;. Instead I decided to try to persuade networking engineers stuck in the CLI era to move forward. Everyone needs a few windmills in his life, and I seem pretty good at finding them.<br /><br />Interestingly, as someone wrote recently, automation is like losing weight (or a visit to a dentist). It&#39;s often not a rational decision - you try to postpone it as long as possible, but once you get started, it&#39;s hard to figure out how you managed to live without it for so long.<br /><br />As for &quot;if the automation is really needed people will follow this path.&quot; - totally agree with that, but sometimes the need must be huge to force everyone to drop their established habits.<br /><br />@Anonymous: would love to see what you wrote on this topic. Merging a few buzzwords into a sentence is easy.",

Nothing fancy.<br />What I am looking for are new ideas, smart observation, etc. Something what very experience people could share with us and make me thinking.

In his opinion the configuration file you get from APIC is too large to be useful (in reasonably large deployment), and didn&#39;t give him the per-tenant information he wanted to see.<br /><br />But I agree - if all you need is version control of APIC configuration, you can get it done relatively easily (contrary to most other examples I mentioned in that same list).",

          "html": "Hi Michael!<br /><br />Do explore my blog posts a bit more - you might notice that I mention vendor C only when they have something unique (like multi-site EVPN enabled by their ASICs). Also, I&#39;m sick-and-tired of dealing with vendor marketing. It&#39;s much better to focus on fundamentals and understanding technology - that enables you to figure out why some stuff won&#39;t work on your own (but yes, it does require some extra work).<br /><br />If you want to know more about numerous vendors, you could also watch my webinars, for example this one https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=DCFabric. Or this one if you&#39;re interested in whitebox switching https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=OpenNetworking. There are even some free webinars dealing with those topics: http://www.ipspace.net/Subscription/Free<br /><br />Finally, it&#39;s not my fault that Cisco is the only vendor that has a data center fabric controller, or that many engineers find dealing with said controller relevant ;)<br /><br />Ivan",
