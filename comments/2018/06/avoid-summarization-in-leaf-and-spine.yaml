    html: '... and there must be tons of other sources (including my webinars) doing
      the same, and it still keeps popping up.'

    html: 'Ivan,<br />Pointing to your webinars (which I absolutely love and use extensively)
      on your blog would have been redundant ;-) but yes, of course!  '

    html: You wouldn&#39;t believe how many anonymous &quot;thought leaders&quot;
      post authoritative-sounding stupid comments to my blog about things that are
      so clearly explained in either webinars or previous blog posts ;)) <br /><br
      />Makes you wonder what they&#39;re doing the rest of their time :D... but on
      the other hand, they&#39;re a wonderful source of inspiration for future blog
      posts.
