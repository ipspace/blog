Our MAN is based on IGP/iBGP, it was simpler to interconnect with eBGP our underlay than playing with OSPF/BGP redistribution and keeping an end to end bgp-based network. Our fabrics scaling haven&#39;t been a requirement when it came to choose the underlay protocol.",

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love BGP and use it everyday but in one ideal world writing a few extensions for IS-IS or OSPF would have been the way to go to avoid using BGP everywhere.

      "html": "Hi Ivan, Seems like I missed the party due to busy schedule. :)<br /><br />I don&#39;t know how many Network Engineers have to build a Network like this in real life outside Webscales and Cloud providers. But let&#39;s keep that discussion for later. It&#39;s always interesting to hear all kind of reasons from people to deploy CLOS fabrics in DC in Enterprise segment typically that I deal with while they mostly don&#39;t have clue about why they should be doing it in first place. Forget about their understanding of CLOS Fabrics, Overlays etc. Usually a good justification is DC to support high amount of East-West Traffic....but really ? If you ask them if they even have any benchmarks or tools to measure that in first place :)<br /><br />Now coming back to Original question of BGP vs OSPF in DC <br /><br />Interestingly I had a conversation with Arxxxa guys few months back during any interview and I was bashed for proposing OSPF for all wrong reasons. Just because they use BGP in their fabric doesn&#39;t mean everyone has to follow. They even didn&#39;t seem to have any clue about RIFT, Open Fabric, Fibbing etc.<br /><br />As you mentioned &#39; BGP Path Hunting &quot; is an important problem to be solved to reduce the Churn. But of course it comes at it&#39;s own price and downsides.<br /><br />I also saw a comment rejecting EIGRP in favor of multi vendor networking. Well from overlay Networking perspective does EVPN work just fine today ?<br /><br />- How about Fabric Automation and Orchestration in that case ?<br /><br />On a closing note I would like to summarize couple of misconceptions around CLOS Fabric :) ... Please feel free to correct me and add as needed<br /><br />- CLOS AKA Leaf And Spine is Non-Blocking fabric ( Really ? It&#39;s Non Contending but not non blocking)<br />- BGP is the best choice for CLOS (Just because Petr thought ? , but wait Petr was doing this for a WebScale which is far different from Enterprise DC)<br />- BGP is a good choice as it allows granular policy control <br />- BGP has less Churn<br />- BGP Scales far better (In History at least many large ISPs were running OSPF Area 0 for entire network) ... Scale is also a function of HW too and subjective to optimization techniques and so forth<br />- Layer 2 Fabrics can&#39;t be extended beyond 2 Spine switches ( A long argument I had with Arxxxa guys on this. They don&#39;t even count SPB as Layer 2 fabric and so forth)<br /><br />Maybe you would like to cover these mis-conceptions in Spine and Leaf Webinar as updates.<br /><br />TC !!!<br />",
