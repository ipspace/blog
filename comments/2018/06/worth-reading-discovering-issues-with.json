          "html": "And the first comment is perhaps more relevant than I first thought.  Google say they use BBR congestion control for all WAN RPC.  Maybe that&#39;s one potential explanation for ending up with this situation in Envoy.  BBR can&#39;t solve head of line blocking, but it wouldn&#39;t have the second problem &quot;TCP window size will drop dramatically, and all streams will be simultaneously throttled down.&quot;  BBR does not use packet loss as a sign of congestion.  (Or, it has a heuristic to detect policers using packet loss, but they set the threshold for this to 20% :), so I would not expect it to trigger here.  You can see a bulk throughput v.s. loss graph here: https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3022184 ).",
