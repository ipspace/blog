            <div class="comment-content">One of my first true tech roles I was lucky enough to land in a team at a telco where there was a diversity of ages, from one guy who had 6 months to retire and one that was 3 years my junior and everything in between. That job was the best in my career. I received valuable advice from the older guys and motivation from the younger. The boss too was fair, he constantly asked us to think about this question before doing anything on the production systems, &quot;Am I qualified to do this work?&quot; and if the answer was no, then to seek help.</div>
