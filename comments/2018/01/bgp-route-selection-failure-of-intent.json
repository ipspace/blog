For folks that are fed up with this or there\u2019s no way in hell to tweak the protocol to get the intended result there\u2019s the DIY way using source based routing, where you program the intended result yourself (by defining the hop by hop path each packet should take). <br />As you can see the first approach is like setting up pins on Galton board so that most beans end up in one bucket and the more buckets you want to fill the more pins you need and the whole things becomes very complicated.<br /><br />Adam Vitkovsky<br />adamv0025.netconsultings.com",

      "html": "Hi Ivan - nice article... in terms of the &quot;final solution&quot; you described, this is exactly how the Plexxi controller works. The operator describes the &quot;workload intent&quot; - i.e. what are the performance and security parameters or constraints that are required and our affinity algorithms compute topologies, flow policies, etc, that meet those needs. Everything starts as non-differentiated, so you don&#39;t need to involve the controller up front, only when you have specific declarative needs, and yes it fails back to the standard load-shared network algorithms. And yes, we never started as an &quot;SDN&quot; company, we started as a company that wanted to define a specific workload management problems for networks and leverage SDN and modern constraint-based algorithm capabilities to help network operators get to a better answer faster.",

The procedural for the very experienced designer of developer. This a hierarchy of reuse, too. You create something useful in procedural and the others could reuse it in declarative mode without getting into the details. <br />A contemporary network would have both local intelligence in the network nodes and customization in a central controller. Formerly, the central element was called the network management system. Now we can have fancier names... :-)<br />",

      "html": "As Ivan pointed out, any definition of intent-based which consists entirely of declarative inputs would only work in a fantasy world. A large group of innovators from both vendors and network operators worked to create a much more specific and meaningful definition. In this type of intent-based system the power and value comes not from claiming that you can build infrastructure without prescriptive inputs to the implementation, but from carefully separating the description of the high level human/business goals from the description of the implementation choice specifics. Such a system has two types of input:<br /><br />Intent- Description of intended state that is completely free of any implementation specific references. Interfaces, devices, addresses, protocol types, vendors, OSI layers are not allowed. They are not intent by this definition. Thus you can&#39;t have a meaningful conversation about intent based BGP. It&#39;s already too implementation specific to qualify.  <br /><br />Mapping - Implementation details and choices provided by M2M interaction and/or human expert input. Consists of Applications telemetry (description of app and user identity, etc) and infrastructure telemetry (inventory and status/state  of paths, interfaces,devices, servers, etc). <br />In this architecture the two types of input are needed to feed the &quot;intent engine&quot; which is a process that runs forever automatically changing device configuration and behaviors in response to any change in either the intent input or the mapping input. <br /><br />Intent is that workloads A, B, and C have logical isolation<br />Mappings would provide:<br />A has address X, B has address Y, C has address Z.<br />Logical isolation is implemented using VXLAN (or MPLS VPN)<br /><br />Intent engine sets up tunnels/forward to make the intent come true. If A gets a new address, intent engine changes config to make it true again. And so on. <br /><br /><br />The intent can be created/described by any non expert. <br />The intent can be moved, unmodified to any other vendor, protocol, device, cloud, etc. <br />The intent can be sharded unmodified across an arbitrary number of administrative domains<br />The intent never changes as a result in the change of network state.<br /><br />The address info might come from e.g. VCenter pub/sub<br />The choice of virtualization technologies might be made by an IT expert. <br /><br /><br />Above is just the tip of the iceberg of educating about a definition of Intent-based that actually has some value in the evolving IT landscape. Lots of people have worked hard to validate and define this model. After several years agreeing and publishing a definition in the ONF NBI WG, which I chaired, we are now continuing the work in the MEF Forum&#39;s Intent Based Orchestration WG which I will co-chair with John Strassner from Huawei. Anyone who wants to clear up all the FUD and intent-washing and work on an important and challenging project should reach out and get involved.  <br /><br />Invariant Intent + app telemetry + infra telemetry are sufficient inputs to build an autonomous system with infrequent manual inputs mostly from non-experts. There is still a need for some experts at the ecosystem level, but not every system user needs  to be one, unlike today&#39;s operating model.  Lower OPEX, shorter time to service and repair, eliminate many causes of human error. Better SLAs. Love to discuss this more with folks... <br /><br /><br />Dave Lenrow, CN3 Systems",
