So sad...&quot;<br /><br />Just because someone has a non-zero market share doesn&#39;t mean that <br /><br />(A) I&#39;ll actively track everything they do. There are too many more interesting things out there, and I never claimed to be an industry analyst. With many vendors I have friendly SEs who send me an occasional email saying &quot;read this&quot;.<br /><br />(B) I agree with what they&#39;re doing just because they are Vendor X. Every vendor got upset with my vies every now and then. Now it looks it&#39;s Juniper&#39;s turn ;)<br /><br />(C) What they&#39;re doing makes sense. Remember that we&#39;re talking about reasonably-sized data center fabrics... and even if you have a data center fabric use case that needs EVPN at scale where IGP is no longer a viable underlay option, I&#39;d guess it&#39;s an outlier due to very peculiar circumstances.<br /><br />Finally, I was never talking only about configuration complexity (and related IOS or EOS configuration has similar complexity as Junos) but the complexity of what&#39;s going on behind the scenes. Also, you might have missed the &quot;ignore AS-path check&quot; tweak (or is Junos turning off BGP loop prevention logic by default?)<br /><br />As for &quot;MLAG-dependent kludges&quot;, I&#39;m pointing that out every time I talk about EVPN and MLAG, but because they did one thing right doesn&#39;t mean that everything else they do makes equal sense.<br /><br />As I wrote above, I think we can agree that we disagree on whether this is sane and move on.

In this design spine does not receive any EVPN routes at all. All that spine see is just eBGP IPv4 routes from leafs, like in simple L3-only fabric.<br /><br />Leaf switch doesn&#39;t need &quot;to be&quot; in one single AS - it uses one AS number for eBGP, and another completely independent AS number for iBGP. Look for config example above. This is complete BGP config - AS number is not configured under routing-options stanza. So in this example leaf switch in AS 65011 for eBGP and in AS 65000 for iBGP simultaneously.",

I might also consider anonymous comments saying &quot;my concoction works perfectly assuming you know what you&#39;re doing&quot; highly irrelevant as it clearly applies to a zillion of &quot;just because you could doesn&#39;t mean that you should&quot; ideas, and your &quot;assuming you know what you&#39;re doing&quot; remark only validates my opinion. Thanks for that ;)",

I have no idea who you are or what you know (google brought me here in a search), but if you believe segregating control and data planes via eBGP and iBGP is complex, then running an IP fabric isn\u2019t for you (and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that).  Finding good talent is incredibly hard.  There way more mediocre network engineers out there who have a limited working knowledge of BGP vs truly talented ones who really understand the protocol inside and out.  Apologies for the anonymous posts, but circumstances dictate.  Best of luck for the future with your site.",

      "html": "Interesting discussion guys, and there\u2019s nothing &quot;technically&quot; wrong with using a single instance of eBGP in an IP fabric.  But \u2026. with a link failure you could potentially have millions of MAC routes withdrawn and relearned (or at least we do on the scale we build/deploy to).  When using eBGP underlays and iBGP overlays, link failures don\u2019t cause the iBGP overlay (with our ~1M MAC routes) to re-converge and impact performance.  I understand it\u2019s added complexity on the front-end, but BGP control/data plane segregation will save you issues down the road when dealing wth large IP fabrics.  Granted our IP fabric networks are larger than most and not typical, but after looking at this problem space for 3 years this is the solution that works for us.  As always, your mileage may vary.",
