          "html": "Yes, such approach is perfect recipe for &quot;technical debt&quot;, which will require resolving at some stage. Problem is when you add such debt on top of &quot;ways around&quot; other problems. That ends up in messed up project, which eventually will die or will require 2, 3 and sometimes 10 times more man power to resolve or simply can&#39;t be resolved at all. Example Maximum Path Length Limitation in Windows = 260 ???????? where &quot;NTFS supports paths up to 32,000 Unicode characters long&quot;, just simple mess in code somewhere in Windows, which can&#39;t be resolved)",

      "html": "In the business environment, where you need to deliver something on time, you see MANY issues you simply skip. Why? Not because you are not curious but you do not have time to think about them.<br /><br />When you deliver a product you do not do all possible tests  - you simply test it against requirements. You do not fix every issue - you fix only those which affect the features you deliver.<br /><br />I know that sometimes the issue you see may have impact on other parts of the network.<br />TIME is MONEY. MONEY rules. Theoretically we should think think about long term goals but we don&#39;t. Quick fixes win;) Sad.",

          "html": "Working for networking business for 25 years I am little bit sceptic about &quot;do it right way&quot; and &quot;first time&quot;. The complexity is huge of the big project. We use so many devices from many vedors and want to integrate them. We see them like &#39;lego block&#39; but we cannot anticipate feature interaction. At some point in the system development you see that there are more issues then we expected / seen during Prove of Concept phase. Vendor cannot something fix within our timeframe so we need to resort to quick fixes many times. <br /><br />The problem is the the World is NOT perfect. We cannot make the vendor fix something to release something on time. If we could fix all issues ourselves... <br />",
