            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />as always, i loved the podcast, but I did have an observation i wanted to make.  David and Noopa did an excellent job of describing the differences between namespaces and VRFs, but it wasn&#39;t clear what namespaces were good for.  It seems like it might have been worth mentioning that containers make extensive use of namespaces to provide isolation.  there appear to be 7 different namespaces providing all sorts of isolation.  <br /><br />i also wanted to suggest that maybe namespaces and containers might be an excellent topic for your next linux podcast.  keep up the good work!</div>
