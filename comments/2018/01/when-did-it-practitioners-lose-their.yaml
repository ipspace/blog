    html: Yes, such approach is perfect recipe for &quot;technical debt&quot;, which
      will require resolving at some stage. Problem is when you add such debt on top
      of &quot;ways around&quot; other problems. That ends up in messed up project,
      which eventually will die or will require 2, 3 and sometimes 10 times more man
      power to resolve or simply can&#39;t be resolved at all. Example Maximum Path
      Length Limitation in Windows = 260 ???????? where &quot;NTFS supports paths
      up to 32,000 Unicode characters long&quot;, just simple mess in code somewhere
      in Windows, which can&#39;t be resolved)

  html: In the business environment, where you need to deliver something on time,
    you see MANY issues you simply skip. Why? Not because you are not curious but
    you do not have time to think about them.<br /><br />When you deliver a product
    you do not do all possible tests  - you simply test it against requirements. You
    do not fix every issue - you fix only those which affect the features you deliver.<br
    /><br />I know that sometimes the issue you see may have impact on other parts
    of the network.<br />TIME is MONEY. MONEY rules. Theoretically we should think
    think about long term goals but we don&#39;t. Quick fixes win;) Sad.

    html: Working for networking business for 25 years I am little bit sceptic about
      &quot;do it right way&quot; and &quot;first time&quot;. The complexity is huge
      of the big project. We use so many devices from many vedors and want to integrate
      them. We see them like &#39;lego block&#39; but we cannot anticipate feature
      interaction. At some point in the system development you see that there are
      more issues then we expected / seen during Prove of Concept phase. Vendor cannot
      something fix within our timeframe so we need to resort to quick fixes many
      times. <br /><br />The problem is the the World is NOT perfect. We cannot make
      the vendor fix something to release something on time. If we could fix all issues
      ourselves... <br />

  html: 'Yep, some people don&#39;t understand simple thing: &quot;Do it right way&quot;
    and I would add &quot;,first time&quot;.<br />But it&#39;s easier to do something,
    which is &quot;kind of working&quot; and then quietly wait for somebody, else
    to figure it out and fix it for you. Plain laziness mixed with lack of respect
    to others, closely followed by stupidity. Welcome to IT world.'

  html: Doing plain stupid things is overall bad. To search for the perfect solution
    may in some cases  take ages and thus turn out to be even worse than a half baked
    thing.

  html: https://www.cio.com.au/article/65115/all_systems_down/<br />lack of curiosity
    can lead to catastrophic outages.  This isn&#39;t about resources always being
    limited, or there always being priorities, it&#39;s about we have smart expensive
    people in these roles for a reason, and that reason is their judgment (in light
    of both intelligence and education) in the decisions they make, whether big decisions
    or the day to day little decisions.

  html: 'The business case is king (the prince2 good stuff). An engineering department
    that has spent some time studying and understanding an organization&#39;s business
    case, model and strategy is always ahead of the feature request curve. <br />If
    a capability request takes the department by surprise it is not part of the organization&#39;s
    competitive advantage. '
