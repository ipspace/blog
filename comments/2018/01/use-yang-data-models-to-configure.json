This is not a hostile assessment of you&#39;re statement, I&#39;m genuinely interested in how you came to this conclusion....",

So many gaps in vendor&#39;s (at least Cisco&#39;s) standard models this isn&#39;t quite worth it just yet for me.<br /><br />I think said vendors are very incentived to catch up now because this is now table staged for any Enterprise, SP, or any forward thinking midmarket entity.",

We do get:<br /><br />* Consistent configuration mechanism<br />* Consistent error reporting<br />* Defined data models (so we know in advance what can be configured)<br />* Data models that can be parsed directly into Python code<br /><br />In any case, there&#39;s not much difference between network device configurations and SQL dialects. Those guys couldn&#39;t even agree on how to limit the number of results returned by a SELECT query ;) - see https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_top.asp",
