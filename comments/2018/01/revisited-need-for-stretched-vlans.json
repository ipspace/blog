The reason for that was to simplify the network, so that workers/devices on the central location will have the same connectivity. So you can prepare the printer with the IP address and you can simply plug the printer on the remote location and everything is working... :)",

Even if you stretch using a method that is somewhat well thought out like oh-tee-vee, when you throw a poorly designed app on top you will ultimately start hacking the DCI to make the app work thus putting both DCs at even higher risk of meltdown.  Example: disabling arp suppression to make NLB work.  And people wonder why cloud providers are taking over.  Enterprise vendors think they are solving customer problems with overlay monstrosities when they are actually just gifting the clouds more business.  Stop re-packaging old world tech if you want to survive.",

      "html": "+1 on simplistic routing<br /><br />I am trying to push VRF functionality into modeling and bare-metal provisioning software based on the new Linux Kernel VRF-lite code (thanks a lot to those who upstreamed this) to avoid L2 stretching or static route usage pad.lv/1737428.<br /><br />Currently the modeling software helps with endpoint discovery based on the fact that hosts are multi-homed but does not help with routing.<br /><br />The VRF functionality needs to be there to make sure hosts are not turned into routers (security and operational reasons). At the same time, with VRFs there is no reliance static routes on a given host.<br /><br />In general, I would say that VIP/FIP-oriented failover mechanisms constrain software deployments to a single L2.<br /><br />* Keystone (OpenStack) catalog is a good example of that problem: a single hostname can be used as a catalog entry and clients only expect a single hostname;<br />* Highly-available load-balancers suffer from the same problem.<br /><br />Doing L3 properly certainly requires more effort: either clients should be clever enough to select from multiple endpoints and do failover correctly or L3 infrastructure should be good enough to support ECMP with hosts using loopback interfaces with correct addresses. Multiple highly-available load-balancers + multiple A records per load-balancer hostname is another option but it just tries to hide the L3 part and has certain limitations with regards to user session management (not to mention that you have to resolve first =&gt; think about DNS high-availability).<br /><br />Or, you can do VIPs on a single L2 which is why software vendors require that (who knows if you meet a qualified enough network team? Will their security team allow peering? Does a software vendor have the right network expertise?).<br /><br />Thanks for the post!",

As example Cisco have been really aggressively pushing us to buy into their SDA solution. It currently seems to rely mostly on VXLAN overlays that let you stretch layer 2 domains. The selling point being you can click buttons in a GUI and just pretend its magic and not a layer 2 overlay. I was told by someone from Cisco &quot;you don&#39;t need to worry about what it&#39;s doing&quot;... which sort of translated to &quot;shut up and buy it&quot;. Large layer 2 domains are something we&#39;ve been slowly moving away from for years, we no longer have the same reliance on layer 2 connectivity in the majority of the campus. Most of our legacy applications are long gone and in recent times we&#39;ve been trying to ensure no &quot;lazy&quot; application are purchased.",
