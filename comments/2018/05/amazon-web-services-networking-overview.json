          "html": "How nice is that. So the multicast packets are replicated at the source and sent via GRE tunnels. Thus it&#39;s a very scalable solution. Amazon&#39;ve done a great job. So this means now I can host my Webex server and they are doing MOH via multicast streaming with my music source (radio).",

          "html": "Of course it is not scalable. I did say &quot;lift and shift of legacy software&quot; which implies the application needs to be redesigned at some point. If you need to stream to multiple clients from a vpc there are other aws services that can be used. It is the suggested hack that interest me. I am not a network engineer but replicating packets at the source is such an obvious bad idea I was wondering if there could really be applications out there relying on this?",

We use multicast for our Checkpoint VSX cluster sync over a stretched VLAN across 2 DCs (about 500 miles apart). It works really great.",
