Why? Because we wanted to save time &amp; effort for repeatable tasks. <br />For this reason we see automation in other non-IT businesses.<br /><br />I do not think the lack of API is any barrier. We do use CLI a lot.<br /><br />Why the pure economic does not make IT automate things in those places where we can save money?<br />I am against religious attitude. I am talking about money.",

General tasks.<br />2. Full enforce - for ToR switches, ToR switches behave almost the same across all datacenters.<br /><br />General automated tasks - We started to use Ansible to align all the configuration we could, MGMT ACLs, SNMP, Logging and more.<br />Full enforce - We started with Ansible inventory in a hierarchy as follow:<br />Top level - The common information across all datacenters, such as domain-names, snmp community and more.<br />DC level - The datacenter specific information, such as DNS server, NTP server and more.<br />Rack level - The rack information which is the interfaces configuration of the rack.<br /><br />We created templates for each vendor using all this information, comparing and pushing the configuration using NAPALM.<br /><br />Now, most of our network devices are fully enforced from Ansible using NAPALM.<br />On the old devices and devices which are not similar to any other, we&#39;re managing only what we can while working on the alignment of the devices.<br /><br />It was not easy, but I can say it&#39;s worth it!<br />Hop it helps...",
