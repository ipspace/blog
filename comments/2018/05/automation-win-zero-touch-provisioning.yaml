    html: My arista switches are running a python script they download and run on
      boot that uses Ansible Tower&#39;s callback functionality to kick off a job
      that configures them from zero to hero.<br /><br />You need to define a DHCP
      entry for them first, but after that it gets handled for you.<br /><br />It&#39;s
      been a lot cleaner to work with than the nexus POAP setup.

  html: The other problem is non-automatable steps. E.g. Juniper QFX 5100 - ZTP works
    fine, but if you want a virtual chassis, you need to issue one extra command on
    the CLI.

    html: Still no public documentation on their web site (yeah, I know I&#39;m supposed
      to get it when downloading the community edition but nonetheless...) so I&#39;m
      still not impressed ;)

      /><br />There is a little information in here...but at least these guys got
      wise and took out the middle man. They use ipv6 link-local addressing with a
      combination neighbor discovery to locate the controllers. The caveat being that
      the controllers need to be L2 adjacent with the switch mgmt ports that they
      hope to provision. Still...its better than anything dhcp related with all the
      options and image repos involved.

    html: There&#39;s absolutely no useful information there, but fortunately they
      use ONIE which is well documented. Based on what you told me I&#39;m assuming
      BCF is doing this:<br /><br />https://opencomputeproject.github.io/onie/design-spec/discovery.html#discover-neighbors<br
      /><br />It&#39;s definitely in the &quot;how much brute force do you want to
      apply&quot; category.<br /><br />
