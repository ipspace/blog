MP-BGP specification was created to extend BGP to serve as an open signaling layer between network devices for network services, like EVPN, IPVPN, MVPN, etc.  No abuse.  For new application infrastructure design, check out service meshes.",

Instead of languishing away in the IETF as yet another pie-in-the-sky radical idea because it\u2019s too foreign and not well understood, here was a relatively easy win for a protocol less than 5-years running in production.
