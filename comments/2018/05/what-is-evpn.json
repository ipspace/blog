Instead of languishing away in the IETF as yet another pie-in-the-sky radical idea because it’s too foreign and not well understood, here was a relatively easy win for a protocol less than 5-years running in production. Almost like they meant for it to happen ��",

For example:\nVMWare cluster, vmotion, VXLAN traffic, some basic infrastructure services that are prerequisite for the rest - e.g. DNS. To me this looks like a great idea because this is what the L3 underlay really is - simple and robust, and with least dependencies, and this is what these basic infrastructure need. \nNowadays you don&#39;t need stretched VLANs and subnets between the racks to run your VMWare, vSAN and etc. </p>\n\n<p>Continuing this line of thought, i was wondering about reasons for decision on placing the L3 underlay interfaces in default routing table or a VRF, i would really appreciate a meaningful conversation on that topic as well!</p>\n",
