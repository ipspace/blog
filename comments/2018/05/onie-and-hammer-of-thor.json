All I need is the MAC address of the management port, I enter that in and plug the switch in. Minute or so later I start plugging in servers and move on with my datacenter life lol. Don\u2019t get them wrong, they aren\u2019t going to do your campus/WAN/routing or anything like that, but for a datacenter switching fabric it\u2019s nearly perfect. ",
