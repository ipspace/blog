    html: While I firmly believe in &quot;understand the requirements, your architecture
      depends on them&quot;, what you&#39;re saying could be understood as equivalent
      to &quot;evolution is just an alternate theory to intelligent design&quot;.<br
      /><br />Some things are plain wrong no matter what, it&#39;s just very hard
      to admit that sometimes, particularly if you invested too much into them.

    html: No, my intention was different. I just wanted to repeat what I&#39;ve learned
      from you. As you might know repetition is the key to learning.

  html: There is no right or wrong direction. It always depends on your requirements.

    html: I wonder how much this layer 3 campus network costs compared to a traditional
      layer 2 network?

  html: We built an HQ office network based on layer-3/BGP in 2014. It runs perfectly
    fine. I even forgot how to troubleshoot it, because there is no need. <br />

  html: So we replace well understood layer-2 with vastly more complex layer-3 underlay
    with VXLAN overlay and when you need routing vrf with VXLAN. When it fails it
    no doubt fails complex. Yes it provides flexibility and apparently better workload
    mobility but there is a lot to be said for keeping it simple and understanding
    what happens under the hood, just look at ASDM for an example on how an ASA config
    can turn into a steaming pile of crap.
