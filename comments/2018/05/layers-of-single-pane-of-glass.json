      "html": "Just what was mentioned in your meeting with Greg Ferro - http://packetpushers.net/podcast/podcasts/pq-145-greg-ivan-chat/<br /><br />The one important thing that I got out of that podcast was the word &quot;consistency&quot; (which was mentioned several times during the podcast). It doesn&#39;t matter what system you have to work with, if you can check-in/check-out your infrastructure configuration with a text file - you are heading in the right direction. Now I wonder if these crazy new platforms that offer GUI only configuration approaches and a non existent API.. where could we possibly turn to?.. well, browser based automation could be a nightmare - but let&#39;s not hope we should ever rely on something like the Selenium Webdriver. <br /><br />At a bare minimum, we should determine the who, what and why of a device configuration change. <br /><br />Who - Use of RADIUS/ACS/LDAP, no use of a single user - difficult to audit.<br />What/When - Use of centralized logging, consistent time configuration and correlation<br /><br />Why - Was there a business need behind the change, is there an open ticket, or was this an untested/accidental change? - This would most likely at least please your friendly auditor.<br /><br />Then work on getting a configuration management tool in place that would enforce proper and consistent device configurations, no matter what adhoc changes were made on the fly from unknown &quot;AdminX&quot;. - This would most likely save you time and heartache in the long run.<br /><br />Mario",

          "html": "&quot;Don&#39;t ACI and NSX have an API under the covers?&quot; &lt;&lt; of course they do, and as Anonymous pointed out, everything goes through the API.<br /><br />Of course you can do your own integration, but it would be nice to have a simple &quot;configuration file&quot;-like approach (infrastructure-as-code anyone). Cisco ACI has something along those lines, but I&#39;ve been told it&#39;s not exactly useful, and I haven&#39;t found anything for NSX.<br /><br />There are also a few plugins for major provisioning tools. VMware has Terraform plugin... but only for NSX-T, and there&#39;s a third-party Terraform provider for Cisco ACI.<br /><br />However (coming back to the blog post) - that&#39;s not how these solutions are demonstrated and sold, and usually not how they&#39;re evaluated in PoCs.",
