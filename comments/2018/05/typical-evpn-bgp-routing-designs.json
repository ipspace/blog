Maybe worth to join 2019 and revalidate your ancient biases and FUD.",

      "html": "How do you solve host reachability from extern without asymmetric routing at all?<br /><br />Let\u00b4s have 2 sites with EVPN/DCI configured:<br />- First datacenter on site A<br />- Second datacenter on site B<br /><br />Both sites share the same subnet, e.g. 192.168.10.0/24 with the same distributed gateway on EVPN switch A and EVPN switch B<br />- We have one host A connected to the EVPN TOR switch A with IP 192.168.10.1<br />- We have one host B connected to the EVPN TOR switch B with IP 192.168.10.2<br /><br />If you &quot;show arp&quot; on switch A, it will show ARP entry for A<br />If you &quot;show arp&quot; on switch B, it will show ARP entry for B<br /><br />If you &quot;show ip route&quot; on switch A, it will show ip route /32 entry for B via BGP<br />If you &quot;show ip route&quot; on switch B, it will show ip route /32 entry for A via BGP <br /><br />But, <br />if you &quot;show ip route&quot; on switch A, it will not show you any route for host A.<br />if you &quot;show ip route&quot; on switch B, it will not show you any route for host B.<br /><br />Let\u00b4s imagine:<br />if you want to export that /32 host of host A to an external WAN router A which is connected to switch A dynamically, i.e. if host A is connected to EVPN switch A, its /32 host route is exported from EVPN switch A to external WAN router A and therefore the whole ingoing/outgoing traffic for that host is going through WAN router A<br />Vice versa if you want to export that /32 host of host B to an external WAN router B which is connected to switch B dynamically, i.e. if host B is connected to switch B, its /32 host route is exported from EVPN switch B to external WAN router B and therefore the whole ingoing/outgoing traffic for that host is going through WAN router B.<br /><br />The problem is how to get the information out of the ARP table from each EVPN switch to make an /32 host route out of it?",
