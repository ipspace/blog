L3 is still a bit murky (asymmetric versus symmetric), as is multi-fabric behavior (changing next hops on fabric edge).<br /><br />The true &quot;beauties&quot; start when vendors try to persuade you to use &quot;interesting&quot; designs like running IBGP over EBGP for no good reason (apart from lock-in).",
