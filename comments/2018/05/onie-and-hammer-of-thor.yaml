  html: It resembles me old good days from 90ties. Novell Netware, diskless PC with
    bootROM loading DOS (and later even Windows 3) from the Netware Server. Deployed
    tens Netware setups working without any admin emplyed on site. Zero administration
    of PCs....

  html: Thanks for the detailed explanations. It&#39;s seems to be a true Macgyver
    tool. In whatever situation you are in, it get&#39;s the job done.

    html: BigSwitch makes software for data center fabrics, where you&#39;d expect
      the switches to have a separate management network connection back to the controller
      (or whatever you want to call it). In smaller fabrics, the management network
      is indeed a L2 network (including QFabric IIRC).

    html: Sure. My point was that it&#39;s trivial to write something that works over
      a LAN and the same approach would not necessarily work over a WAN. So if you
      are going to have a more comprehensive ZTP, you will need something else, such
      as DHCP to solve the problem.

  html: And why on earth would you have your controller L2 adjacent to the device
    booting up? Unless it&#39;s in a constrained DC environment, which makes the feat
    far less impressive.<br /><br />Wouldn&#39;t work so well for SD-WAN or campus
    networks where you want to template things from a central location...

    html: Dear Anonymous. I reread what I wrote and one of us has serious reading
      comprehension problems. I would suggest you stop reading my blog posts. Obviously
      they annoy you way too much, making you irrational.

  html: http://www.opencompute.org/wiki/Networking/ONIE<br /><br />Created by Cumulus
    Networks, Inc. in 2012, the Open Network Install Environment (ONIE) Project is
    a small operating system, pre-installed as firmware on bare metal network switches,
    that provides an environment for automated operating system provisioning.

  html: Anonymous.  Ivan did not say ONIE was developed by BigSwitch.  He said BigSwitch
    works on whitebox hardware.  The whitebox hardware uses ONIE.

  html: "I remember the first time I watched a switch ONIE boot. The big switch stuff\
    \ is fantastic. I\u2019m just so over caring how my datacenter fabric works under\
    \ the hood. All I need is the MAC address of the management port, I enter that\
    \ in and plug the switch in. Minute or so later I start plugging in servers and\
    \ move on with my datacenter life lol. Don\u2019t get them wrong, they aren\u2019\
    t going to do your campus/WAN/routing or anything like that, but for a datacenter\
    \ switching fabric it\u2019s nearly perfect. "
