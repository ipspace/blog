    html: In theory, it could. The RFC states in the overview section &quot;Note that
      this document assumes that the preference policy for the<br />host destination
      address favors IPv6 over IPv4&quot;. There are more details, so you might want
      to read the whole RFC.

    html: Thanks for clarification. So to me there&#39;s a trade off between going
      to the whole list with those 2 delay timers for finding the best performing
      destination versus going for the first received addresses but maybe getting
      a bad performing destination. It will be interesting to see if the Apple consumers
      appreciate this approach.

  html: Does this mean that the browser could try to connect via IPv4 first? Well
    that would be a step back or turning around in a circle.
