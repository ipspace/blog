    html: Well, now you nailed it (even though I&#39;m suspecting you were in your
      usual trolling mood). If it would be simple I would be doing something else
      ;)

    html: Why the automation was &#39;invented&#39; now?<br /><br />What about the
      economic?<br /><br />I have been working in the system development engineering
      for 13+ years and we have always used automation. Why? Because we wanted to
      save time &amp; effort for repeatable tasks. <br />For this reason we see automation
      in other non-IT businesses.<br /><br />I do not think the lack of API is any
      barrier. We do use CLI a lot.<br /><br />Why the pure economic does not make
      IT automate things in those places where we can save money?<br />I am against
      religious attitude. I am talking about money.

  html: The answer to your question is simple and manifold. The network vendors aren&#39;t
    interested in providing a usuable API (according to your RFP) because they want
    to sell their magic orchestration software to you. On the other hand it&#39;s
    good for Ivan&#39;s business so he can sell his online course to the people. If
    it would be simple noone would care about his course, right?

    html: We know what ACI is. Nobody has a consistent definition of what SDN is...
      apart from &quot;centralized control plane&quot; which has been proven to be
      useless in most environments beyond programmable patch panels.<br /><br />However,
      taking a more relaxed picture on SDN as being &quot;something that provides
      a layer of abstraction useful to consumers of network services&quot; (which
      is as useful as Cloud), ACI is definitely an SDN product.

  html: Interesting topic indeed. <br /><br />What&#39;s your thoughts about Cisco&#39;s
    ACI and SDN?<br /><br />Two different beasts but it seems that there will be synergy
    between them &quot;on the horizon&quot;. <br />

    html: Cool that you found an exception. Of course their infrastructure is their
      business. So my blog post was meant for the rest of us like you and me. FANG
      don&#39;t read this blog or even take Ivan&#39;s course.

    html: I was surprised on both counts, but other than that you&#39;re spot-on.<br
      /><br />However, not automating your infrastructure (or at least application
      deployment) inherently makes you way slower and prone to catastrophic failures,
      so making sure you automate repetitive stuff is also a way of making your business
      adapt faster (assuming you rely on IT in some significant way to get your business
      done).

    Concentrate on your business not on your infrastructure!

  html: I want to share our story of automation.<br />We started our automation journey
    two and a half years ago.<br /><br />We have 6 datacenters, each datacenter was
    built by different engineers with a different approach to work.<br />We have 6
    different network vendors.<br />As you all mentions, it was very very hard, we
    didn&#39;t knew where to start.<br />It took us 3 months of research before we
    even started to write the first line of code.<br />Even after the first line of
    code, we went back and forth so many times.<br /><br />And this is how we did
    it:<br />We took two approaches:<br />1. General tasks.<br />2. Full enforce -
    for ToR switches, ToR switches behave almost the same across all datacenters.<br
    /><br />General automated tasks - We started to use Ansible to align all the configuration
    we could, MGMT ACLs, SNMP, Logging and more.<br />Full enforce - We started with
    Ansible inventory in a hierarchy as follow:<br />Top level - The common information
    across all datacenters, such as domain-names, snmp community and more.<br />DC
    level - The datacenter specific information, such as DNS server, NTP server and
    more.<br />Rack level - The rack information which is the interfaces configuration
    of the rack.<br /><br />We created templates for each vendor using all this information,
    comparing and pushing the configuration using NAPALM.<br /><br />Now, most of
    our network devices are fully enforced from Ansible using NAPALM.<br />On the
    old devices and devices which are not similar to any other, we&#39;re managing
    only what we can while working on the alignment of the devices.<br /><br />It
    was not easy, but I can say it&#39;s worth it!<br />Hop it helps...
