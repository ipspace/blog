    html: Regardless of the sanity of trying to build a multi-vendor fabrics (let&#39;s
      not go there), EVPN seems to be pretty solid when it comes to L2-only forwarding
      in simple environments (IGP + IBGP). L3 is still a bit murky (asymmetric versus
      symmetric), as is multi-fabric behavior (changing next hops on fabric edge).<br
      /><br />The true &quot;beauties&quot; start when vendors try to persuade you
      to use &quot;interesting&quot; designs like running IBGP over EBGP for no good
      reason (apart from lock-in).

    html: 'Actually it works (depending on which IRB methods / evpn prefix adv the
      vendors support, like Ivan said). See interops test result from the MPLS Forum
      (2017) : <br /><br />http://www.eantc.de/fileadmin/eantc/downloads/events/2011-2015/MPLSSDNNFV_2017/EANTC-MPLSSDNNFV2017-WhitePaper-Final_v2.pdf<br
      /><br />Here is the latest that happened 1 month ago :<br /><br />http://www.eantc.de/fileadmin/eantc/downloads/events/2017-2020/MPLS2018/EANTC-MPLSSDNNFV2018-WhitePaper-final.pdf<br
      /><br />I tested in my lab interoperability between Arista &amp; Cisco 9K just
      for fun (no reason to mix leaf/spine from different vendors I agree :) )'

  html: Thanks for the update. So interoperability between vendors would still be
    a dream? Or is it on purpose?
