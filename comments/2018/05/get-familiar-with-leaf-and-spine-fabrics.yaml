    html: 'Some of us have to pay our bills while producing free content. Yeah, I
      know that&#39;s hard to grasp.<br /><br />Speaking of free content: you probably
      produced more than I did, so please point me to it - would love to see some
      more good stuff out there.'

    html: eh - I consider it more of advocating better, simpler, and more effective
      network designs. There just simply is not much else out there that provides
      this type of content. As a former student of the building next gen dc course
      and a former subscriber I can vouch for the content and say with confidence
      that it is top notch and deserves to be advertised in a informative way every
      now and then...

  html: Is there really nothing new in the east besides your frequent repetitions
    and your advertisements? It&#39;s a pity. I miss the old days.
