    html: "As a disclaimer, working for Cisco and on VXLAN EVPN specifically makes\
      \ me obviously biased.<br />Regardless, there must be something you confuse\
      \ ... a) NX-OS with VXLAN EVPN is not automated by ACI and b) having a B-option\
      \ doesn\u2019t mean no multi-vendor support. Maybe worth to join 2019 and revalidate\
      \ your ancient biases and FUD."

    html: Maybe I&#39;ve read a different blog post than you. Anyway I join neither
      the future nor a dead horse.

  html: So if you implement Option B you&#39;re locked in by Cisco. And the only way
    to automate all that is by buying Cisco&#39;s ACI. So there&#39;s only Option
    C left.

    html: the /32 from every host is automatically generated on the Leaf (based on
      ARP/ND) and can be used for external reachability. One of the magic thibgs that
      EVPN can bring :-)

  html: "How do you solve host reachability from extern without asymmetric routing\
    \ at all?<br /><br />Let\xB4s have 2 sites with EVPN/DCI configured:<br />- First\
    \ datacenter on site A<br />- Second datacenter on site B<br /><br />Both sites\
    \ share the same subnet, e.g. 192.168.10.0/24 with the same distributed gateway\
    \ on EVPN switch A and EVPN switch B<br />- We have one host A connected to the\
    \ EVPN TOR switch A with IP 192.168.10.1<br />- We have one host B connected to\
    \ the EVPN TOR switch B with IP 192.168.10.2<br /><br />If you &quot;show arp&quot;\
    \ on switch A, it will show ARP entry for A<br />If you &quot;show arp&quot; on\
    \ switch B, it will show ARP entry for B<br /><br />If you &quot;show ip route&quot;\
    \ on switch A, it will show ip route /32 entry for B via BGP<br />If you &quot;show\
    \ ip route&quot; on switch B, it will show ip route /32 entry for A via BGP <br\
    \ /><br />But, <br />if you &quot;show ip route&quot; on switch A, it will not\
    \ show you any route for host A.<br />if you &quot;show ip route&quot; on switch\
    \ B, it will not show you any route for host B.<br /><br />Let\xB4s imagine:<br\
    \ />if you want to export that /32 host of host A to an external WAN router A\
    \ which is connected to switch A dynamically, i.e. if host A is connected to EVPN\
    \ switch A, its /32 host route is exported from EVPN switch A to external WAN\
    \ router A and therefore the whole ingoing/outgoing traffic for that host is going\
    \ through WAN router A<br />Vice versa if you want to export that /32 host of\
    \ host B to an external WAN router B which is connected to switch B dynamically,\
    \ i.e. if host B is connected to switch B, its /32 host route is exported from\
    \ EVPN switch B to external WAN router B and therefore the whole ingoing/outgoing\
    \ traffic for that host is going through WAN router B.<br /><br />The problem\
    \ is how to get the information out of the ARP table from each EVPN switch to\
    \ make an /32 host route out of it?"

    html: If you would do that your MTU would be to small to satisfy the RFC requirement
      both for IPv4 and IPv6.

  html: This is awesome reading! What some customer is asking for is VXLAN/L2 over
    SDWAN with the offered SLA&#39;s that it can provide. do i need to turn to some
    open-source routingplatforms to get it or are there any vendors that offers it?
