      "html": "Have a look at vyos or free range routing, depending on your requirements, these packages can offer decent features and automation. Because linux is under the hood, puppet or chef can be used. Or in the case of vyos, use its juniper like syntax to simply deploy and commit/save configs as a whole. Unless I must, I will always deploy clusters of these as firewalls and routers before looking at a commercial vrouter or vfirewall. ",

      "html": "&quot;You make your cattle someone else&#39;s pet: each application team becomes responsible for their own firewall and load balancer&quot; This was the subject of long debate at my $employer. We have a large enterprise, the apps people want to consume IT like a cloud and of course there is no budget to actually build a fully functional private cloud. The compromise we discussed was microsegmentation and just letting each app team own/manage/operate their own little slice of the network. However, many like the irules, so now we are talking about tons of maintenance OpEx for multiple F5 appliances. And the apps owners aren&#39;t accountable for PCI/PII/SOX audits, so letting them manage firewalls seems unlikely. Further, we&#39;d have to build pretty tight guardrails around every tenant to ensure that they don&#39;t inject routes. Still haven&#39;t found an elegant solution so we are trying to compromise with centrally-managed cattle with limited input from app-owners (such as letting them use their API-driven automation tools to put nodes into F5 pools, or other limited modifications). Still haven&#39;t fully divested ourselves from the &quot;pets&quot; but... baby-steps.",
