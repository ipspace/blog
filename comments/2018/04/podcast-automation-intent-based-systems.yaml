    html: 'I&#39;m positive there&#39;s tons of information out there, but not much
      on using infrastructure-as-code approach in networking.<br /><br />We did a
      bit of that in the network automation online course (Mark Prior had a great
      presentation in the spring 2018 session: https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutSol&amp;module=1#INFRA_AS_CODE
      and Pete Lumbis talked about CI/CD here https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutSol&amp;module=5#M5S3A),
      and I plan to have a separate session focused on this topic (resulting in a
      new course module) in autumn. I also covered how you can manage device configurations
      with Git here: https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutSol&amp;module=2#M2S2B<br
      /><br />If you don&#39;t like my webinars and courses :( then the only good
      book I could recommend on network automation (not sure whether they deal with
      infrastructure-as-code) is http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920042082.do.
      There&#39;s also a pretty good intro presentation from RIPE71: https://ripe71.ripe.net/archives/video/154/<br
      /><br />Further pointers obviously much appreciated.'
