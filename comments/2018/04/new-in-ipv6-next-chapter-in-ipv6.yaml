  html: Failover based on RA, how great is that. RFC 1925 has struck once again. What
    will be next?

    html: Hi namesake. I think you don&#39;t unterstand the problem described in this
      post. You would get 2 PA address ranges because you were multihomed but you
      don&#39;t run BGP with your service providers. Instead you run DHCPv6 PD with
      them. So your servers would get 2 IPv6 addresses from every prefix. So the one
      billion dollar question is now how do you deal with a failure between you and
      and your service provider with that scenario?

  html: Multipath TCP is the right approach to solve multihoming problems from an
    architectural viewpoint. We should stop having single path transport protocols
    whose connections are bound to one particular IP address.

    html: 1) do we really want to have /48 in global routing table for every coffee
      shop or 10-people office?<br />2) some small companies have no resources and
      no desire to deal with RIRs and become LIRs (and it expensive).<br />3) In some
      scenarios ISPs might not want/be able to run BGP with those customers.

  html: I was wondering why enterprise cant have dedicated block of IPv6 address and
    ISP&#39;s route the traffic to it. Enterprise shall select the ISP&#39;s based
    on the routing and preferences configured? If any looping has to be avoided then
    EVPN kind of solution can be used?

    html: Hi Jen, really nice to hear from you (big fan of your work!).<br /><br />&quot;some
      very popular vendors support automation which allows the config to be changed
      based on events&quot; &lt;&lt; assuming you can run the code on the same device.<br
      /><br />I believed in the magic powers of adaptability, flexibility and automation
      years ago and designed my home network around that... only to get phone calls
      along the lines of &quot;Daddy, I can&#39;t print the photos I need for my homework&quot;
      every time I&#39;d be somewhere far off ;) Now it&#39;s as simple as I can possibly
      make it ;))

      you can run the code on the same device.<br /><br />Well, I&#39;m talking here
      about things like JunOS event policies/even scripts. So yes, they are run on
      the devices.<br /><br />&gt;I believed in the magic powers of adaptability,
      flexibility and automation years ago and designed my home network around that...
      only to get phone calls along the lines of &quot;Daddy, I can&#39;t print the

      ;) Now it&#39;s as simple as I can possibly make it ;))<br /><br />LOL ;) You
      know the most interesting thing about all that? (and it also answers the very
      first comment about &#39;OMG, it&#39;s too complicated, whet&#39;s next&#39;...)
      This functionality *already* here for small CPEs. When I first realized I need
      in in enterprise network, the answer I got was &#39;get rid of expensive Junipers
      and Cisco, get TPLink with OpenWRT on it, it would do that&#39;. So if we are
      talking about home network - you don&#39;t need to think about it, it&#39;s
      here (thanks to RFC7084). It&#39;s all about bringing it to enterprise grade
      boxes.<br />I&#39;m talking about it this Thu, at IPv6 WG at RIPE btw.<br />/

  html: 'Well, the key point is it does not need to be implemented on hosts. Everything
    hosts need is already here (the whole idea of that draft was not to rely on the
    Rule 5.5 which is not yet supported by some popular OSes). For router support...well,
    we are getting there as at least one vendor has had the corresponding feature
    request opened for years...but the good news is: some very popular vendors support
    automation which allows the config to be changed based on events. So it can be
    done right here, right now, no need to wait for anything to be implemented...;)<br
