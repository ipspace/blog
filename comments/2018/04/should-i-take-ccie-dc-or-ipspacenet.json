There&#39;s much more to next-gen DC than that (the whole &quot;nine-yards&quot; of automation in Nex-Gen DC, architecture design, multi-vendor aspects, ...).<br />But hey ... I may be biased :)",

      "html": "I have done both! If you already have an advanced network engineering position, and are looking to expand your general architecture and best practices knowledge, do Ivan&#39;s course first, and then CCIE DC later. If you are however looking for best option for return-on-investment, and looking to get a promotion and or a better role at another organization, CCIE DC would be your best bet.<br /><br />You also gotta consider the amount of effort (hours) and costs involved in both options too. By the time you are done your CCIE DC, in between multiple attempts required, costs of exams, and flying out to exam centers, plus the costs of training material, you are looking at least $14,000-15,000 total costs, probably a little more. CCIE exams are also one of the toughest exams you can take - so count on spending at least 2000 (yes, two thousand!) hours of studying and practice if you want to have a serious shot at passing the exam. Having said all that, it&#39;s STILL VERY MUCH WORTHWHILE - because the return on investment is insane. You&#39;ll make that money back within a couple of months after starting a new role as a CCIE DC.<br /><br />Ivan&#39;s course is far easier, small fraction of the cost, and will require only a couple hundred worth of hours of effort.<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t even say it&#39;s an apples to orange comparison - it&#39;s like apples to eggplant comparison ;)<br /><br />Both are very different, for different purposes, different outcomes and different return-on-investments. I&#39;d highly recommend both.",
