            <div class="comment-content">Paragraph 6a from RFC 1925 strikes here once again. It&#39;s amazing to see that you can in fact explain every problem in the tech field with RFC 1925. Ross had very visionary findings over 20 years ago. I think people turn around in a circle (and they can&#39;t escape).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Funny, I actually forgot Phil did last year this podcast and (re-)listened now. First, Phil is one of the coolest DEs around here and always a privilege to work or have a beer with for one. And NETCONF is one of the darn&#39;d magic pieces here that allows you to do stuff in days that would take you months elsewhere as customer/developer. Not only the frontend which allows you to bash quickly whole beds of JunOS devices with bitsy ssh &amp; rollback, patch loads but also pyEz, albeit slower, makes doing insanely complex stuff hilariously easy. You&#39;d like all disabled OSPF interfaces, just XPATH &#39;protocols/ospf/area/interface[disable]/name&#39; out the returned XML config and you&#39;re done. And on the newest front take a look @ the JET stuff and GRPC real-time telemetry we ship today where automation is being taken even further ... Yes, shell is shell and it&#39;s great to stick together bunch unix filters on a host but managing complex data models on large number of networking devices, if you care whether things ultimately work ;-), is a bit of a different pair of shoes that is something that is probably RFC1925 clause 4 so it doesn&#39;t bear to explain further ;-)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Anytime I hear an &quot;end of &#39;xyz&#39;&quot; announcement, I ask why.  Why tells you a lot - if the reason to move off from a CLI-based interface is so that the view of every networking device is consistent and making changes better fits the model of how things work, yes.  If it&#39;s so you can use a mouse instead of a keyboard - really?  I&#39;ve never been a fan of form over substance, since it usually just recreates an existing problem in a new form.  If a gui helps someone understand the underlying mechanism of something, then it&#39;s a good long term thing.  If it hides things from view or worse yet distorts the view of underlying things, it can do harm.<br /><br />I recently heard someone parrot &quot;This is where IaC saves us&quot; - not realizing that code isn&#39;t magical.  I do think that Cisco&#39;s declarative model (Opflex) is step in the right direction because it allows implementation to be separated from design - not because you can use a mouse.  Just stop caring if it&#39;s a gui or a cli and start caring if it&#39;s consistent and helps to clarify how things work in principle.</div>
