    html: Most everyone supports that - but it makes for a really messy BGP setup.
      It&#39;s easier to run IBGP-over-IGP in that case unless you have more than
      hundred or so switches in your fabric.

  html: At least Juniper supports an option to have eBGP as an underlay routing protocol
    and iBGP as an overlay, allowing to have unique ASN in underlay and common ASN
    in overlay, thus making it possible to use automatic RTs.
