You would get 2 PA address ranges because you were multihomed but you don&#39;t run BGP with your service providers. Instead you run DHCPv6 PD with them. So your servers would get 2 IPv6 addresses from every prefix. So the one billion dollar question is now how do you deal with a failure between you and and your service provider with that scenario?",

(and it also answers the very first comment about &#39;OMG, it&#39;s too complicated, whet&#39;s next&#39;...) This functionality *already* here for small CPEs. When I first realized I need in in enterprise network, the answer I got was &#39;get rid of expensive Junipers and Cisco, get TPLink with OpenWRT on it, it would do that&#39;. So if we are talking about home network - you don&#39;t need to think about it, it&#39;s here (thanks to RFC7084). It&#39;s all about bringing it to enterprise grade boxes.<br />I&#39;m talking about it this Thu, at IPv6 WG at RIPE btw.<br />/ Jen<br />",

Everything hosts need is already here (the whole idea of that draft was not to rely on the Rule 5.5 which is not yet supported by some popular OSes). For router support...well, we are getting there as at least one vendor has had the corresponding feature request opened for years...but the good news is: some very popular vendors support automation which allows the config to be changed based on events. So it can be done right here, right now, no need to wait for anything to be implemented...;)<br />Jen L.",
