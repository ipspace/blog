    along the lines: whenever you do something really ingenious that shortens your
    code, write a good comment to keep the size constant.'

    html: My dear Anonymous friend,<br /><br />Yet again you managed to completely
      miss the point of the post. That&#39;s been happening a lot to you lately...
      I&#39;m worried. Are you too much in a hurry?<br /><br />All the best,<br />Ivan

    html: Yes, I&#39;m very busy at the moment reinventing the wheel. But I&#39;ve
      done a great progress. By the way where is your new blog post so I can comment?
      As you might know time is valuable.

    html: '&quot;You may write write-only code in any language&quot; &lt;&lt; I totally
      agree with that, but some things (like data manipulation or complex decision
      trees) are better handled in some languages than others - there&#39;s the right
      tool for every job.<br /><br />See also http://web.mit.edu/humor/Computers/real.programmers

  html: To be honest I don&#39;t see the difference between embedding some logic in
    template and writing own filter for a single task. In both cases, after some time,
    one must check, what was coded and why. You may write more on less write-only
    code in any language and IMHO moving something from template to custom filter
    makes sense only if this part will be reused in other places.
