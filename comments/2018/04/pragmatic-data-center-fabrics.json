Many companies are therefore forced to buy at least 2 pieces of it. So  chassis switches will have a future. And non-blocking fabrics are a dream. Maybe I live in another world.",

It just means Gartner is really late, considering CLOS networks exist since 1952 (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clos_network).<br /><br />A network topology, being a physical implementation of a mathematical object with some desired properties, doesn&#39;t really become obsolete, it either solves the problem at hand or not. In the latter case you need another topology (www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15418-s12/www/lectures/18_interconnects.pdf)",
