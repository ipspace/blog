            <p class="comment-content">May it be BGP EVPN or a directory service with reachability infromation (kept on hypervisors) and a custom encapsulation, in the end they all are trying to solve the same underlying problem. They all have to use those 40 years old protocols like Ethernet and IP. In my opinion those approaches aren&#39;t an evolution. They are just continuous product improvements for capex and opex reduction. And they keep the consultants employed and the vendors also hugely benefit from that.</p>
