            <div class="comment-content">Hi namesake. I think you don&#39;t unterstand the problem described in this post. You would get 2 PA address ranges because you were multihomed but you don&#39;t run BGP with your service providers. Instead you run DHCPv6 PD with them. So your servers would get 2 IPv6 addresses from every prefix. So the one billion dollar question is now how do you deal with a failure between you and and your service provider with that scenario?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I was wondering why enterprise cant have dedicated block of IPv6 address and ISP&#39;s route the traffic to it. Enterprise shall select the ISP&#39;s based on the routing and preferences configured? If any looping has to be avoided then EVPN kind of solution can be used?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">1) do we really want to have /48 in global routing table for every coffee shop or 10-people office?<br />2) some small companies have no resources and no desire to deal with RIRs and become LIRs (and it expensive).<br />3) In some scenarios ISPs might not want/be able to run BGP with those customers.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Well, the key point is it does not need to be implemented on hosts. Everything hosts need is already here (the whole idea of that draft was not to rely on the Rule 5.5 which is not yet supported by some popular OSes). For router support...well, we are getting there as at least one vendor has had the corresponding feature request opened for years...but the good news is: some very popular vendors support automation which allows the config to be changed based on events. So it can be done right here, right now, no need to wait for anything to be implemented...;)<br />Jen L.</div>

So yes, they are run on the devices.<br /><br />&gt;I believed in the magic powers of adaptability, flexibility and automation years ago and designed my home network around that... only to get phone calls along the lines of &quot;Daddy, I can&#39;t print the photos I need for my homework&quot; every time I&#39;d be somewhere far off ;) Now it&#39;s as simple as I can possibly make it ;))<br /><br />LOL ;) You know the most interesting thing about all that? (and it also answers the very first comment about &#39;OMG, it&#39;s too complicated, whet&#39;s next&#39;...) This functionality *already* here for small CPEs. When I first realized I need in in enterprise network, the answer I got was &#39;get rid of expensive Junipers and Cisco, get TPLink with OpenWRT on it, it would do that&#39;. So if we are talking about home network - you don&#39;t need to think about it, it&#39;s here (thanks to RFC7084). It&#39;s all about bringing it to enterprise grade boxes.<br />I&#39;m talking about it this Thu, at IPv6 WG at RIPE btw.<br />/ Jen<br /></div>
