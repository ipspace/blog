      "html": "For dual-PA-/48 multihoming, the IETF homenet protocol suite was very promising for the longest time.  I even had a test setup built which worked nicely.<br /><br />Alas, they took too long to finish their standards - now vendors are shipping IPv6 CPEs with a &quot;non-homenet&quot; protocol suite - and there is little commercial interest anywhere to change that.<br /><br />But there is an interesting twist to SoHo multihoming - I think &quot;network multihoming&quot; is a dead end for these setups, because nowadays almost all devices have a LTE chip anyway, so if the SoHo Wifi network looses Internet connectivity, you just fall over to LTE - and with MP-TCP or a good VPN solution, you don&#39;t even notice anything...",

Thank you.<br /><br />&quot;ICE works fine for those&quot; &lt;&lt; I know way too little about VoIP, but it seems to me ICE is nothing more than NAT traversal, and we might still need to encrypt the VoIP traffic.<br /><br />Same for remote printers - some organizations would want to encrypt the traffic in transit.",

Microsoft DirectAccess and Apple&#39;s Back-to-my-Mac both use IPsec to bring a remote network local.<br /><br />Remote VoIP phones doesn&#39;t have a problem -- ICE works fine for those.<br /><br />Remote printers could work fine, if the printers used service discovery via DNS, such as mDNS, and the enterprise&#39;s printer queues embraced that technique instead of their crusty IPv4 dotted-decimal addresses.",
