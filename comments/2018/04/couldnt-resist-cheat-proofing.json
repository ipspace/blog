Certification also shows discipline and dedication. And those who cheat in certifications are easily outed in interviews. I tell everyone to always do certifications. They are great ROI in almost all IT careers, not just networking. ",

      "html": "For me certs have always been about learning. So whether someone argues that the CCIE is less valuable now or not is not very relevant to me. I went through certifications to learn and to become a better engineer. Certifications are a guided learning path. If you treat them as such, they will always be valuable.<br /><br />I&#39;ve done SME work in the past so I know how difficult it is to produce good content. It&#39;s fairly simply to come up with a couple of questions and fairly simple to work out one alternate answer to a question that seems reasonable. It&#39;s much more difficult to think of two or three reasonable answers that are wrong.<br /><br />I definitely agree that certifications shouldn&#39;t have to carry their own cost. How much gear has Cisco sold through the years because of certifications? Billions and billions again. For some of the higher level certs I wouldn&#39;t be against some form of interview but it scales poorly and is open for interpretation and people will sue the vendors because they think they have been mistreated *sigh*.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a silver bullet to create good certs. It takes a lot of hard work and because people cheat the exams that lashes back on the people trying to take them honestly because the tests are filled with trivia type questions.",

I did my CCIE in 2010 after two years of passing my lab I went through divorce which made my Dyslexia into worse condition and end up losing my job. Two years to recover and now I am preparing for CCIE Wireless and it took me 1.50 years to pass written. I hope I will pass Lab exam and I am fighting against Dyslexia but most employer don&#39;t understand difficulties we are experiencing to learn and retain memory. It take us double or triple time to beat those exams but we don&#39;t give up. I hope some people will understand pain of Dyslexia. My passion for technology and learning never die even though I am nearly 50 years old.  ",

      "html": "I took the CCDE exam back in the early days because most of my work at the time was design/architecture and the CCIE didn&#39;t seem like the best investment at the time. (incidentally, I was in the same exam as Scott Morris who was on his 3rd attempt). The CCDE was interactive - a wrong answer led you further down the rabbit hole in the scenario. To be honest, I felt that exam did test your theory because it framed scenarios, let you select which supporting docs would help you, and it was brutal. Wasn&#39;t perfect, but I think it is a good starting point. Do they still have value? Not so much... the world is changing so quickly, people are pushing to cloud, building private clouds and using hybrids with overlaying management. Plus you may find large enterprises migrating from one platform to another so your CCIE may help with your ACI deployment but not so much with a large scale NSX deployment. Certs are like a college degree at this point... it simply indicates to an employer that you put some time in. We interviewed a CCIE for a position a couple years ago and hired the other non-CCIE candidate instead... he had far more real-world experience and therefore answered some of the tricky questions much better. YMMV.",

      "html": "Many years past now, Cisco once did a pretty decent job with the CCIE Written exam (at least R&amp;S). There were clearly SMEs involved in the development of test scenarios and questions (e.g. &quot;Review the following topology. When the R5&lt;-&gt;R6 link goes down, how many queries are necessary in order for EIGRP to fully converge?&quot;). They now apparently employ professional test writers exclusively who scour the online product literature for questions such as &quot;The following product/solution that Cisco is currently championing (but will soon be poo-pooing in a few short years as a horrible idea in need of replacement) has which of the following benefits (pick five out of seven)?&quot; To make matters worse, my understanding is that some sort of ISO certification that Cisco pursued for their certification program bars any sort of &quot;collusion&quot; between the cert guide authors (SMEs) and the test writers, only further dumbing things down. Since the written is no longer a test of knowledge, and I have reached the 10-year mark with my digits, it&#39;s Emeritus all the way from here on out. The challenge I face now is educating folks as to just how little it means to pass (or fail) the marketing quiz that the CCIE Written has devolved into. ",

This is something that in my experience always been pretty poor within IT, regardless of vendor.<br /><br />I think the real question is how do you prevent people cheating? Easy, give them an incentive not to. Make learning fun and targets achievable. Perhaps vendors and certification bodies should invest more time in a quality structured material. Stop capitalizing on education, and make exam re-takes affordable. When it costs several hundred dollars to take a test, you are always going to breed a sub-industry that will undermine honest achievement.<br />",
