    html: As I was saying for a long time ... ;) <br /><br />https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=BCloud#2SWITCHES<br
      />http://www.ipspace.net/Optimize_Data_Center_Infrastructure<br /><br />As for
      &quot;competing with the cloud&quot; - I hear various opinions from people who
      know better than I do, so it looks to me like saying &quot;you can&#39;t compete
      with public transport&quot;.

  html: Why would you do such a big effort for just hosting your mainframe? 2 switches
    and 2 routers are enough. Everybody goes to the cloud. You can&#39;t compete with
    the cloud.

    html: '... maybe you don&#39;t need more than two fixed-sized switches: http://www.ipspace.net/Optimize_Data_Center_Infrastructure<br
      /><br />... maybe a leaf-and-spine fabric is less complex and cheaper than two
      core switches: http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/06/so-you-need-issu-on-your-tor-switch.html<br
      /><br />As always, there is no right answer.'

  html: In todays data centers it&#39;s all about cost. If enterprises could take
    the risk of operating just one core switch, they would do so. Many companies are
    therefore forced to buy at least 2 pieces of it. So  chassis switches will have
    a future. And non-blocking fabrics are a dream. Maybe I live in another world.

  html: In my opinion Ivan&#39;s indoctrinated theory pretty much diverges with the
    reality.

    html: Not really. It just means Gartner is really late, considering CLOS networks
      exist since 1952 (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clos_network).<br /><br />A network
      topology, being a physical implementation of a mathematical object with some
      desired properties, doesn&#39;t really become obsolete, it either solves the
      problem at hand or not. In the latter case you need another topology (www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15418-s12/www/lectures/18_interconnects.pdf)

  html: Now that Garner is pushing leaf/spine, does that mean it&#39;s officially
    obsolete? ;-)
