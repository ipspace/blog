  html: For dual-PA-/48 multihoming, the IETF homenet protocol suite was very promising
    for the longest time.  I even had a test setup built which worked nicely.<br /><br
    />Alas, they took too long to finish their standards - now vendors are shipping
    IPv6 CPEs with a &quot;non-homenet&quot; protocol suite - and there is little
    commercial interest anywhere to change that.<br /><br />But there is an interesting
    twist to SoHo multihoming - I think &quot;network multihoming&quot; is a dead
    end for these setups, because nowadays almost all devices have a LTE chip anyway,
    so if the SoHo Wifi network looses Internet connectivity, you just fall over to
    LTE - and with MP-TCP or a good VPN solution, you don&#39;t even notice anything...

    html: '&quot;One doesn&#39;t need TLS&quot; &lt;&lt; True. Updated. Thank you.<br
      /><br />&quot;ICE works fine for those&quot; &lt;&lt; I know way too little
      about VoIP, but it seems to me ICE is nothing more than NAT traversal, and we
      might still need to encrypt the VoIP traffic.<br /><br />Same for remote printers
      - some organizations would want to encrypt the traffic in transit.'

  html: "One doesn&#39;t need TLS (n\xE9e SSL) VPN to ignore transport address.  IPsec\
    \ can do that, too.  Microsoft DirectAccess and Apple&#39;s Back-to-my-Mac both\
    \ use IPsec to bring a remote network local.<br /><br />Remote VoIP phones doesn&#39;t\
    \ have a problem -- ICE works fine for those.<br /><br />Remote printers could\
    \ work fine, if the printers used service discovery via DNS, such as mDNS, and\
    \ the enterprise&#39;s printer queues embraced that technique instead of their\
    \ crusty IPv4 dotted-decimal addresses."
