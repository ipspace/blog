  html: In my opinion there are 4 (amateur) comedians in this podcast talking about
    recycling old network technologies and mixing them together. The end result is
    a hexagonal wheel which will eventually work but it&#39;s not clear for now. For
    people who want to learn something new, they can skip to 55:07

    html: Yeah, I probably should have pulled the plug on this one... but I thought
      there was still some pretty useful information in there regardless of how it
      sounds (and trust me, herding the cats would be easier).<br /><br />Lesson learned...

    html: Well, the podcast did answer two of my questions I posted for the upcoming
      Next-Gen DC course, so it was useful (and a bit of fun) to me :-)

  html: I can&#39;t take this talk serious. For me it&#39;s too much giggling. I wonder
    what Ivan and his friends had consumed before the recording.
