      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br />as this happens to be the topic I was really interested in, here are some other solutions that use VXLAN in the hypervisor:<br />1. Contrail - proprietary vRouter managed by XMPP, EVPN from the controller<br />2. Nuage - &quot;proprietary&quot; OVS managed by OpenFlow, EVPN from the controller<br />3. OpenDaylight - OVS managed by standard OpenFlow, EVPN from the controller (Quagga)<br />4. BaGPipe BGP - OVS managed by local agent, EVPN from the host (ExaBGP)<br />5. FRR/Quagga - Linux bridge, EVPN from the host<br />That, of course, is not including non-overlay solutions (e.g. Calico) and myriad k8s plugins.<br />",

          "html": "#3 is a a part of NFVi solution from Ericsson (https://www.ericsson.com/ourportfolio/digital-services-solution-areas/cloud-sdn?nav=fgb_101_0363). Last time I checked they used a fork of Quagga with 6WIND&#39;s EVPN implementation (eariler than Cumulus)<br />It did require quite a bit of tinkering a year ago (https://networkop.co.uk/blog/2017/12/15/os-odl-netvirt/). Its target market are SP/Telcos ($$$) so it&#39;s safe to assume that they tailor and automate each solution individually.<br /><br />#5 - I&#39;ve only seen DIY&#39;ed (https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2017-vxlan-bgp-evpn). And yes, you need to a lot of tinkering and be as smart as Vincent Bernat to build it",

Reading the Cumulus blog post (see above) I got the impression that #5 isn&#39;t exactly ready for production use. <br /><br />I also keep wondering how much self-assembly (and tinkering) is required to get #3 to work.<br /><br />Would you know of anyone packaging and shipping #3 and/or #5 as a solution?",
