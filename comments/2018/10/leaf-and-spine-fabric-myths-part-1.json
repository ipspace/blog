      "html": "<br />Thank you Ivan (and Mr. Evil CCIE) for pointing this out. It has always annoyed the heck out of me that many people blindly assume that all characteristics of a *circuit-switched* Clos network (where indiviual circuits are carefully groomed) autmatically apply to a *packet-switched* network with the same topology (where individual flows are subject to the semi-random placement whims of ECMP hashing).<br /><br />Another pet pieve is that people simply assume that a Clos fabric of small switches is exactly the same as a &quot;disassembled&quot; chassis switch (leaf switches = line cards and spine switches = fabric cards). Some high-end chassis switches provide lots of extra functionality (e.g. virtual output queues to avoid head-of-line blocking, breaking packets up in cells across the backplane fabric for near-perfect ECMP, etc. etc.)<br /><br />Just to be clear: I am NOT saying you should go and buy an expensive chassis switch instead of building a Clos fabric out of cheap commodity switches. I am just saying that you should be aware of the difference.<br /><br />And, since I am in rant mode :-), please folks, it&#39;s Clos (after Mr Clos) and not CLOS (it&#39;s not an acronym).",

      "html": "So, since Bruno chimed in I can&#39;t resists to add <br /><br />a) the &quot;most people build oversubscribed IP fabrics&quot; is a bit of a myth itself, <br />   my (non-representative ;-) sample indicated that many build 1:1 fabrics<br />   to avoid according oversubscription problems<br />b) An exploded fabric (that&#39;s what I call IP Clos fabric often when talking <br />   about chassis replacement ;-) is _not_ an equivalent as Bruno says, the &quot;what you pay <br />   for it strictly applies here&quot;. &quot;Proper&quot; chassis fabrics  <br />    i) are cell-based (for reasons obvious when you ran packet based backplanes) <br />   ii) do multicast very efficiently<br />  iii) as stated offer tons funky HOL blocking logic, QoS queuing &amp; so on<br />   iv) are completely self-configuring and never try to do zig-zags (by now it should <br />       remind of a certain routing protocol we pursue ;-)<br />c) I still don&#39;t know whether Clos was Belgian or French ;-) ? <br /><br />",
