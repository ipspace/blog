          "html": "Obviously using my own argument the answer is NO. However (like any other vendor) Cumulus has tested certain scenarios more thoroughly than others, and they started with EBGP-only, preferably on unnumbered interfaces, so I&#39;d expect them to have fewer bugs in that particular design.<br /><br />Also, compared to most everyone else, BGP is a breeze to configure in FRR. Specify neighbors by interfaces and whether they&#39;re internal or external, and you&#39;re done.",
