  html: 'Mostly packet switching never believed in having standards for managing a
    device for mostly biz reasons. Management plane usually had the weakest engineers
    who never could undertand data modeling. Features in network devices are mostly
    customizations for a particular deployment instead of a holistic solution. This
    suited everyone since vendors ended up charging for these customizations and categorized
    as service revenues and recurring revenue. This enabled companies to package themselves
    as software companies. Network automation for packet switching shall remain a
    dream for some time since automation infrastructure for one device cannot be reused
    easily for another device whether we use restful apis or not. But that would remain
    an aspirational goal for some time to come. Large companies and ISPs shall invest
    in it to leverage monitoring data . But mostly they shall be customized solutions '

  html: Plus, a shortage of people with the right skill set means smaller/distributed/outsourced
    teams having to manage larger and more complex infrastructure.
