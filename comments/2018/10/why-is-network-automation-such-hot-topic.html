            <div class="comment-content">Mostly packet switching never believed in having standards for managing a device for mostly biz reasons. Management plane usually had the weakest engineers who never could undertand data modeling. Features in network devices are mostly customizations for a particular deployment instead of a holistic solution. This suited everyone since vendors ended up charging for these customizations and categorized as service revenues and recurring revenue. This enabled companies to package themselves as software companies. Network automation for packet switching shall remain a dream for some time since automation infrastructure for one device cannot be reused easily for another device whether we use restful apis or not. But that would remain an aspirational goal for some time to come. Large companies and ISPs shall invest in it to leverage monitoring data . But mostly they shall be customized solutions </div>
