      "html": "Some challenges from my experience sparked some thoughts:<br /><br />- what is the network baseline - which &quot;anomalies&quot; are &quot;normal&quot; in the network - not to be misled by not-related-to-the-main problem (other) issues<br /><br />- coincidence of a few issues a the same time - this makes the problem visible once per week/month/year (notice: issue vs problem)<br /><br />- limitation of black box troubleshooting (places where the vendor&#39;s debug commands fail to report e.g packet drop OR when you enable debug command and the whole timing is affected and the problem is not seen) <br /><br />- problem of reproducibility at vendor&#39;s lab<br /><br />- etc, etc<br /><br />I wonder what is the troubleshooting approach used by people doing troubleshooting of the complex systems for more than 15-25 years. <br /><br />Do they always use this model for non-trivial cases? <br /><br /><br /><br />",
