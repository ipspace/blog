    html: 'While I (as is most often the case) totally agree with you, you&#39;re
      talking about reasonable world. Unfortunately I&#39;ve seen way too many cases
      where people kept heaping abstraction layers on top of abstraction layers out
      of sheer laziness or worse. <br /><br />I would say this is the canonical example:
      https://qz.com/646467/how-one-programmer-broke-the-internet-by-deleting-a-tiny-piece-of-code/<br
      /><br />Also, I&#39;m guessing we&#39;re both old enough to remember Pascal
      (and other compiled languages), and I don&#39;t think our speed of development
      (of reasonable-quality code) was ever significantly impacted by the compilation
      time.'

    html: 'As to compile, try 40-50 MLOC lines (as in millions ;-) of code that is
      nothing particular at all for a complex system these days ... Only an extended
      handful of shops have people smart/hard working/experienced enough to keep compile
      times/abstraction/sanity on something like this in parameters ... <br /><br
      />But then yes, as anything, abstraction and layering can be a fetish ;-) <br
      /><br />And ultimately, I wouldn&#39;t mention JavaScript and reasonable in
      the same sentence or even book ... JavaScript is like PHP, it&#39;s a statement
      of belief largely rather than a logical calculus a normal programming language
      is. '

    html: Looks like we&#39;ll have to continue this discussion over (a large set
      of) beer(s). You&#39;re talking about giant monolithic systems, whereas the
      article mostly focuses on the crap deployed as web apps... and yes, most of
      its rant is targeting the likes of JavaScript and PHP.

    html: 'I&#39;m not talking monolitic, I&#39;m talking reasonable _systems_ whether
      you put them together with some freebies and automation or buy a vertically
      integrated product or mix things. Those things have huge volumes no matter what
      you do ... But that&#39;s beside the point. <br /><br />If we talk PHP and JavaScript
      it&#39;s not worth the time, it&#39;s not a very interesting discussion IMO
      and it seems an odd discussion for ipSpace anyway ... '

      and yet a lot of so-called SDN and automation stuff out there is written in
      Python which might or might not be better than PHP based on your religious beliefs

  html: 'There are many more aspects to the whole thing than the rather naive (IME)
    post. First, optimizing software makes it inherently less portable, less maintainable
    and ultimately more &quot;fragile&quot; normally. If the problem is well understood,
    doesn&#39;t change quickly and justifies lots of resources to be solved @ high
    performance, then it&#39;s worth doing, most problems in software are not like
    this. Ultimately, if the problem is _really_ well understood, performance _really_
    matters and there is _real_ money on the table, silicon is built which is a very
    rigorous process. But then lots of people turn around and are disappointed that
    a free lunch of high-performance and 2 weeks release cycles is not attainable.
    <br /><br />When requirements are loose and are changing fast (which is the enchantment
    of the day  as in &quot;software can do anything and be changed on a whim&quot;)
    and there isn&#39;t enough money in it on top (enters open-source) and on top
    of the top it has to be kept maintainable (staff turnover, portability, stable
    APIs to plug into other stuff) then layering and abstraction naturally takes over
    (which is really our only way to deal with massive amount of complexity in somewhat
    predictable fashion by containing the blast radius of the entropy being pumped
    into the system). Layering means indirections and that means performance loss
    on today&#39;s computer architecture in prevailing languages @ least. There is
    work being done in modern CS emphasizing &quot;zero-cost-abstraction&quot; and
    natural parallelization (which is a rewarding but difficult path to performance)
    but this ends up in lambda-calculus corner pretty much which @ this point in time
    few programmers understand IME since it&#39;s more math than the usual &quot;let&#39;s
    put bunch loops and ifs together&quot; and slides quickly into distributed systems
    theory that is easy to get 99% correct and then the last 1% is impossible to debug
    if one doesn&#39;t have enough understanding of the basics of it ...  <br /><br
    />well, my usual 2c &quot;no free lunch&quot; flavor ... '

    html: 60% ascetics !<br /><br />Did you mean aesthetics/esthetics? (a branch of
      philosophy dealing with beauty and the beautiful)<br /><br />Or did you really
      mean asceticism? (a lifestyle characterized by abstinence from sensual pleasures,
      often for the purpose of pursuing spiritual goals)

  html: 'Honestly, it is all of our faults.  We like and/or created the users who
    like easy and pretty application experiences.  Modern programming and software
    design is 5% problem solving, 60% ascetics, 25% making it as idiot &quot;resistant&quot;
    as possible, then 10% more problem solving due to adding all the unnecessarily
    ascetic touches and idiot resistant bloat.  Yes, idiot resistant; there is no
    such thing as idiot proof.  We are caught in a repeating cycle of dumbing things
    down and prettying them up, just so the current user base can utilize things without
    thought. This breeds the next generation of less resourceful users.  Honestly,
    we all love the benefits of the new &quot;easy button&quot; world.  Just think
    of the early morning call with your parents or other family members trying to
    explain how to do something tech related....  That being said, the art of simplicity
    is being lost.  We could all use a little RFC1925 rule 12 like methodology in
    our designs.    '
