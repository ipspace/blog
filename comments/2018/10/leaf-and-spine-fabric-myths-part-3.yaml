  html: Interesting post and observation! However running any kind of stack/VC for
    spines would be awful - software error could take down the whole spine layer very
    easily. ICCP/VPC already make the control planes a little closer than I&#39;m
    comfortable with.<br /><br />Once you get to the levels of bandwidth that warrant
    more than 2 spines, I would have thought you should be thinking long and hard
    about running a layer 2 fabric at all.

    html: '&quot;Any half-decent EVPN deployment should support that using ESI-LAG&quot;
      &lt;&lt; Yep... HALF-DECENT and SHOULD are the important keywords ;)'

  html: "&gt; Even more, some fabric solutions support LAG across more than two switches\
    \ even when using independent control planes. The late Brocade was the first one\
    \ I\u2019m aware of; Juniper might be able to do something similar in EVPN deployments.<br\
    \ /><br />Any half-decent EVPN deployment should support that using ESI-LAG. Juniper\
    \ certainly does."

  html: A routed fabric could also work on layer 2.5 with standard MPLS segment routing
    for transport and BGP EVPN/VPNv4/VPNv6 for services. If spines only do transport
    then multipath for leaf to leaf is basic segment routing property, with MPLS-SR
    on the virtual forwarder multipath on dual home server-leaf connections don&#39;t
    need MLAG/vPC/ESI-LAG.
