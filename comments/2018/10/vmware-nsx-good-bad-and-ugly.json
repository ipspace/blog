      "html": "Regarding the &quot;send through the tunnel&quot; vs &quot;bypass&quot; - I use this to create exceptions to the networks I allow to simplify my private networks list. For example, If I wanted to provide access over the SSL VPN to all the networks from 172.16.0.0 through 172.16.255.0 EXCEPT 172.16.100.0 I could just add 172.16.0.0/16 as a private network to send over the tunnel but then add 172.16.100.0/24 as a network to bypass the tunnel.  Some folks don&#39;t like the grouping mechanism because it doesn&#39;t easily allow for changes down the road, however.",
