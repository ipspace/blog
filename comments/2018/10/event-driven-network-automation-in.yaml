    html: I had much the same discussions when the whole centralized control plane
      stupidity came out - fast feedback loop executed across unreliable relatively-high-latency
      links is a recipe for disaster.<br /><br />However, the problem with BFD (or
      any other similar mechanism) is that it can only trigger vendor-predefined actions.
      EEM (and equivalents) can bring you to custom actions, but they still cannot
      be coordinated across more than one node (my &quot;should we bring the flapping
      link down&quot; example).

    html: Yes, exactly. I am in the phase of moving from one vendor to another, and
      need to preserve failure detection (3x 300ms BFD timer), and propagate the change
      throughout the network. So moving to the new vendor is always a challenge. Not
      to mention how different can be implementation of the same RFC (so many grey
      areas implemented differently).

  html: It looks similar to the discussion I had when was assessing SDN/OpenFlow Centralised
    Controller solutions to handle local link failure. <br />Is this fast enough to
    reprogram the (OpenFlow-based switches) to the new path?<br /><br />As a result
    we still use BFD-based solution to trigger OSPF changes...<br />In other words
    we handle the local failure locally without centralised controler...
