    html: The cost of deploying DNSSEC if you&#39;re on Cloudflare is zero (modulo
      educating yourself which is a good idea anyway). What exactly is your point?

  html: 'There you have it: &quot;The cost of deployment must be lower than the return
    on that cost&quot;. Same with DNSSEC. It will be a dream forever.'

  html: IPv6, RPKI, BGPsec, DNSSEC, ..... whatever the real cost, if the perceived
    cost is high, deployment will lag severely (or fail). Can we call it lack of &quot;killer
    app&quot; ? I happened to hear delirious reasons for not going forward with IPv6,
    all of them based on the FEAR of high support cost. Just that. FEAR.<br />On the
    other hand, you see projects going forward very painfully (and way over budget)
    because lack of understanding of the real costs and a perceived pontential benefit
    that it very doubtful.<br />So yes, it&#39;s UNFORTUNATELY all about business...
