          "html": "I had much the same discussions when the whole centralized control plane stupidity came out - fast feedback loop executed across unreliable relatively-high-latency links is a recipe for disaster.<br /><br />However, the problem with BFD (or any other similar mechanism) is that it can only trigger vendor-predefined actions. EEM (and equivalents) can bring you to custom actions, but they still cannot be coordinated across more than one node (my &quot;should we bring the flapping link down&quot; example).",

          "html": "Yes, exactly. I am in the phase of moving from one vendor to another, and need to preserve failure detection (3x 300ms BFD timer), and propagate the change throughout the network. So moving to the new vendor is always a challenge. Not to mention how different can be implementation of the same RFC (so many grey areas implemented differently).",
