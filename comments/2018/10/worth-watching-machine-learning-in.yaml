  html: 'Great talk, so fun to watch, thanks for sharing. <br /><br />Somehow it reminded
    me of Remy (http://web.mit.edu/remy/), a TCP congestion control implementation
    based on machine learning. Which might not be so bad, because congestion control
    only cares about performance, not functionality, but still. '

  html: Great show but very little specific information. Need to spend almost 1 hour
    to learn that ML is bad;) Frankly speaking this conclusion is expected since the
