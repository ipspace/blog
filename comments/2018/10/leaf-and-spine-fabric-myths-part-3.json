      "html": "Interesting post and observation! However running any kind of stack/VC for spines would be awful - software error could take down the whole spine layer very easily. ICCP/VPC already make the control planes a little closer than I&#39;m comfortable with.<br /><br />Once you get to the levels of bandwidth that warrant more than 2 spines, I would have thought you should be thinking long and hard about running a layer 2 fabric at all.",

The late Brocade was the first one I\u2019m aware of; Juniper might be able to do something similar in EVPN deployments.<br /><br />Any half-decent EVPN deployment should support that using ESI-LAG. Juniper certainly does.",
