  html: The OSPF cannot support large CLOS fabrics is one of the most frustrating
    myths out there. <br />Building and running a fabric using OSPF that scales beyond
    10k devices is not that difficult. <br />No nerd knobs are required just some
    careful design choices.<br /><br />

    html: Obviously using my own argument the answer is NO. However (like any other
      vendor) Cumulus has tested certain scenarios more thoroughly than others, and
      they started with EBGP-only, preferably on unnumbered interfaces, so I&#39;d
      expect them to have fewer bugs in that particular design.<br /><br />Also, compared
      to most everyone else, BGP is a breeze to configure in FRR. Specify neighbors
      by interfaces and whether they&#39;re internal or external, and you&#39;re done.

  html: Hi Ivan! Would You use eBGP only solutions having Cumulus Linux within 2-tier
    8 rack small fabric with L2 extended (vxlan/evpn) requirement?
