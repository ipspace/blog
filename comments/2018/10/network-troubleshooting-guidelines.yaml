  html: 'Some challenges from my experience sparked some thoughts:<br /><br />- what
    is the network baseline - which &quot;anomalies&quot; are &quot;normal&quot; in
    the network - not to be misled by not-related-to-the-main problem (other) issues<br
    /><br />- coincidence of a few issues a the same time - this makes the problem
    visible once per week/month/year (notice: issue vs problem)<br /><br />- limitation
    of black box troubleshooting (places where the vendor&#39;s debug commands fail
    to report e.g packet drop OR when you enable debug command and the whole timing
    is affected and the problem is not seen) <br /><br />- problem of reproducibility
    at vendor&#39;s lab<br /><br />- etc, etc<br /><br />I wonder what is the troubleshooting
    approach used by people doing troubleshooting of the complex systems for more
    than 15-25 years. <br /><br />Do they always use this model for non-trivial cases?

  html: Reminds me of my generic Troubleshooting 101 https://bsdosx.blogspot.com/2009/11/troubleshooting-101.html
    and 10 laws of Networking https://bsdosx.blogspot.com/2009/02/10-laws-of-networking-partial.html
    which are essentially about seeking truth and partitioning fault domains recursively
    to hone in on variables.... observability and telemetry + logs a prerequisite
    of course!

  html: All great points that need to be supported by a solid monitoring, alerting
    and incident management framework.
