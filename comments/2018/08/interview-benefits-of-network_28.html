            <div class="comment-content">Automation is hard, that is all i can say, we have like a small core network team consisting of 3 people working with 10 programmers to automate the network. First you need to define the service you want to deliver to your customer. (this is one is already hard, since big enterprise customers want all kind of goodies, so you have to say no and reason with them that standardizing is a good thing) As long as the functional needs of the customer are covered the customer should not really worry about the underlying technology. <br /><br /><br />We tried doing the YANG approach, but this is way to much information for a normal person, since the big vendors have completey different models for the same thing. What about openconfig you say? We tried looking into that, but these are really plain, but never the less a good starting point for your mindset. For instance we want to deliver a single router with a connection to a PE. Where to start?? Sofar we modelled ethernet-interface, ip-interface, tunnel-interface, ha-interface, bgp-config, inet-ipv4/v6 etc. All this stuff is placed into a DB with key, value pairs, where the KEY is the object name and the value is the variable. This variable needs to transform into the correct configuration that resides on the box.  <br /><br />Next up is the question if your network model should be represented in the Database model equally. You could say well put everything in one big table and provision from there. But wait you also want to deliver 2 routers.. hmmm damn.. i need to model everything apart so we can use the network model as lego blocks to provision my service. Oh wait... sales has put in another vendor... What to do now? create a new models for this new vendor or augment the standard model with vendor like models... so many questions. We are getting there for sure but that is only because we have 3 people and we pretty much agree fast over how to do it. In BIG enterprise IT, i would say impossible with all the politics around. just my 2 cents :)</div>
