      "html": "Another great podcast! Maybe relevant, but the podcast link below explains a bit about how and why a company chose the path of building a leaf/spine network with pods using Cumulus NOS, VXLAN/BGP/EVPN with puppet/ansible automation mixed in. I found this podcast to be a &quot;poster child&quot; of how and why today&#39;s modern networks should be build - assuming you have the right resources (most importantly people, policy and process/procedures - this cannot be done if any of the three are missing).<br /><br />Podcasts like these are worth their salt in gold :)<br /><br />Thanks Ivan and Dinesh!<br /><br />https://packetpushers.net/podcast/weekly-show-404-running-open-networks-production/",

The real reason for a new routing protocol is as always a commercial one. Now I\u2019m wondering how the advocates react after Dinesh peed on their parade.",
