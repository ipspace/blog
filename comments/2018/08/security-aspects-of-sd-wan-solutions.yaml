  html: 'Andraz: The work I did belongs to the customer and I am under NDA. The blog
    post gives enough information about the methodology used and some basic security
    principles. Just ask the vendor for the information concerning security architecture
    and key management and then look at the details.'

    html: The &quot;less secure&quot; aspect is completly missing from the SD-WAN
      vendor marketing materials.. <br />Being nearly as secure as a traditional WAN
      would be substantially better than what I&#39;ve seen so far.

  html: Traditional WAN will always be more secure than SD-WAN solutions. Due to fewer
    interactions and smaller attack surface. However, it was not meant to be more
    secure in the first place.

    html: 'If you take a datacenter technology (SDN) and put it in use in a WAN environment
      the threat scenario and the security requirements change<br />The article is
      definitely as relevant to Cisco&#39;s SD-WAN efforts as to those of other SD-WAN
      solution vendors. '

  html: Key question is, which vendor was evaluated? <br />Can see the article hardly
    relevant to i.e Cisco iWAN, more to those which historically were not involved
    in networking and their SD solutions appeared like mushroom after rain.<br />
