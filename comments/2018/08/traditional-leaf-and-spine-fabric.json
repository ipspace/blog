      "html": "3 years into an ACI deployment in one part of our business we are embarking on another 3 year cycle of ACI globally. ACI is a very good tool to allow people to migrate from legacy infrastructures, and move into the SDN landscape. It abstracts away a lot of nerd knobs and exposes usable APIs to the organization to they can become more \u201ccloud native\u201d without handing everything over to Amazon et al. <br /><br />All our deployments are app centric and driven via YAML/Ansible, so we have taken a nasty hierarchical model made the workloads \u201cwell described\u201d and when we hit renewal next year we are better placed to assess the landscape and move in any direction we choose. <br /><br />ACI should be considered first and foremost for what it is - SDN lite with a support contract. You can make it complex or you can make it a simple black box, the point is it moves you forward as a Netops platform within your business, without completely reinventing the wheel. You then have baby steps towards a fancy open fabric. ",

We&#39;re actually building an additional data center and decidet against ACI.<br /><br />Here are some reasons:<br />* ACI manages the network fabric only<br />* Automation tools like Ansible are time-consuming but could manage your infrastructure as a whole<br />* There are only the 93 series of Nexus switches ACI capable, so there is no extendet mix and fit (for instance using 3000ers with deep buffer at low cost or anything)<br />* ACI clashes together with solutions like NSX or OpenStack platforms, which are using their own approach of network virtualization technologies - so, there must exist a good concept that targets not only the network gear, but also the consumers of network<br />* ACI is a monster and don&#39;t think this would be easy to soak, you have a good chance to end up in serving coffee for the external consultant, who will do the initial setup<br /><br />But by far the substatial argument for not using ACI was, that our data center infrastructure is to small and the tasks in this infrastucture are to few to have a benefit from using it. Just think - you have an additional zoo of servers to maintain providing controller services for ACI.<br /><br />I think that we, the network guys, should make friends with the idea, that we would be much more devops engineers in future.",
