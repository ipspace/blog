  html: Automation is hard, that is all i can say, we have like a small core network
    team consisting of 3 people working with 10 programmers to automate the network.
    First you need to define the service you want to deliver to your customer. (this
    is one is already hard, since big enterprise customers want all kind of goodies,
    so you have to say no and reason with them that standardizing is a good thing)
    As long as the functional needs of the customer are covered the customer should
    not really worry about the underlying technology. <br /><br /><br />We tried doing
    the YANG approach, but this is way to much information for a normal person, since
    the big vendors have completey different models for the same thing. What about
    openconfig you say? We tried looking into that, but these are really plain, but
    never the less a good starting point for your mindset. For instance we want to
    deliver a single router with a connection to a PE. Where to start?? Sofar we modelled
    ethernet-interface, ip-interface, tunnel-interface, ha-interface, bgp-config,
    inet-ipv4/v6 etc. All this stuff is placed into a DB with key, value pairs, where
    the KEY is the object name and the value is the variable. This variable needs
    to transform into the correct configuration that resides on the box.  <br /><br
    />Next up is the question if your network model should be represented in the Database
    model equally. You could say well put everything in one big table and provision
    from there. But wait you also want to deliver 2 routers.. hmmm damn.. i need to
    model everything apart so we can use the network model as lego blocks to provision
    my service. Oh wait... sales has put in another vendor... What to do now? create
    a new models for this new vendor or augment the standard model with vendor like
    models... so many questions. We are getting there for sure but that is only because
    we have 3 people and we pretty much agree fast over how to do it. In BIG enterprise
    IT, i would say impossible with all the politics around. just my 2 cents :)
