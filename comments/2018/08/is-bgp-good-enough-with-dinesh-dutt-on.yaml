  html: Another great podcast! Maybe relevant, but the podcast link below explains
    a bit about how and why a company chose the path of building a leaf/spine network
    with pods using Cumulus NOS, VXLAN/BGP/EVPN with puppet/ansible automation mixed
    in. I found this podcast to be a &quot;poster child&quot; of how and why today&#39;s
    modern networks should be build - assuming you have the right resources (most
    importantly people, policy and process/procedures - this cannot be done if any
    of the three are missing).<br /><br />Podcasts like these are worth their salt
    in gold :)<br /><br />Thanks Ivan and Dinesh!<br /><br />https://packetpushers.net/podcast/weekly-show-404-running-open-networks-production/

  html: "I had problems with understanding Dinesh&#39;s indian accent but I could\
    \ catch that BGP and the existing link state protocols are good enough for every\
    \ leaf/spine/super-spine topology. The real reason for a new routing protocol\
    \ is as always a commercial one. Now I\u2019m wondering how the advocates react\
    \ after Dinesh peed on their parade."
