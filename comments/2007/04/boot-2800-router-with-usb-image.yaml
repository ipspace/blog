  html: I just found out today, it does not - if you try to the rommon command to
    show devices (I forget what it is, the help menu is real short though), it&#39;s
    not listed. My config did have that command in there, still nothing. If you are
    trying to save space by keeping your image on a USB (like I was), you&#39;ll get
    burned sooner or later
