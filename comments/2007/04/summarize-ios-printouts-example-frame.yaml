  html: Looks like the pipe character &brvbar; isn't showing in your output there.  &amp;brvbar;
    will show that in HTML reliably.  <BR/><BR/>I love this trick, though.  I wish
    there was a detailed study on exactly which bits of Regular Expression functionality
    are implemented in the include/exclude/begin output filters.  I actually liked
    "begin" so much that I duplicated its functionality on my FreeBSD machine.<BR/><BR/>Just
    found your blog yesterday, looks to be a great resource.
