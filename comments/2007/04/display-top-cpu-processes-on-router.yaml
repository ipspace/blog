  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I there a process/ script to check top 5 processes  on
    CPU? When I run &quot;sh process cpu sorted | e 0.00&quot; i still get ~15 entries.
    I just want top 5 to be filtered from this output. <br /><br />I was thinking
    of piping this output in a text file and then parse first 5 lines from it.<br
    />Is it possible to write a perl/tcl script to read first five lines of output
    and then display it?<br /><br />Any help will be greatly appreciated.<br /><br
    />Regards,
