If yes, then it might be the missing ARP entry for your remote router (your local router should still find MAC address of your remote router to send ping to it). So it might still be just the same situation as stated in article.<br />BTW, if you &quot;debug ip packet&quot; then you will see that debug for the first packet (in case ARP was not resolved earlier) says &quot;Encapsulation failed&quot;, so I can presume it means &quot;I could not encapsulate this packet due to missing ARP entry for this IP address&quot;.",
