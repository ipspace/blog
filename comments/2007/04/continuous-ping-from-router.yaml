  html: There is a better way to accomplish a continuous ping.  You could use IP SLA/SAA
    to generate the pings.  You can also retrieve the data from a snmp MIB.

  html: This is the first time im noticing this. In Linux, continuous ping is the
    default nature and in Windows, we can achieve it with a &quot;-t&quot; option.
    <br /><br />Today when I was configuring PIM, I needed a continuous ping within
    Cisco IOS...<br /><br />Thanks for the info and thanks for spending your precious
    time for educating others... God bless you...<br /><br />J Thomas, <br />Technical
