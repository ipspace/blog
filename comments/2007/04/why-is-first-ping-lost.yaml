  html: No difference. The IP packet that triggers ARP request is dropped unconditionally.
    No timeout will help you, as there is no retransmission with ICMP.

  html: There could be some buffer to store ICMP packet to store and once ARP request
    resolved, the buffer can release the first packet. why this is not happening??

  html: IP is designed to be an unreliable protocol, so when a packet is dropped in
    the network (or delayed for too long), the source will retransmit. If you delay
    the packet in the network for too long, you might end up with duplicate packets,
    which could cause quite a headache for some poorly written applications. <BR/><BR/>It's
    thus better to drop what you can't handle immediately and let the source deal
    with the problem ... and anyway, with CEF glean adjacencies ARP tables almost
    never time out.

  html: I&#39;ve seen this also cause SLB load balancing to fail out all the real
    servers until their IP&#39;s have all been manually pinged and have entries in
    the ARP cache.

  html: Are there any other causes? I&#39;m seeing this on a single SRX firewall to
    a host that is already in the ARP table. It only happens if I wait around 50seconds+
    before attempting a new ping. Any pings within that time frame get through 100%

  html: Would be good to mention why 2nd packet is not dropped as well - when target
    receives 2nd packet sent (1st for target) then why there is no need for ARP request
    to reply to it and drop target&#39;s first response.

    html: '&gt; If I ping the LAN interface of a remote branch router<br />Are your
      routers connected via Ethernet? If yes, then it might be the missing ARP entry
      for your remote router (your local router should still find MAC address of your
      remote router to send ping to it). So it might still be just the same situation
      as stated in article.<br />BTW, if you &quot;debug ip packet&quot; then you
      will see that debug for the first packet (in case ARP was not resolved earlier)
      says &quot;Encapsulation failed&quot;, so I can presume it means &quot;I could
      not encapsulate this packet due to missing ARP entry for this IP address&quot;.'

  html: If I ping the LAN interface of a remote branch router, I still have the same
    problem.  This doesn&#39;t seem to fit the explanation, as the router shouldn&#39;t
    need to perform an ARP broadcast/discovery to locate its own address, right? After
    all, it is the layer 2/3 boundary.<br />Is there something I&#39;m missing, or
    that can explain this issue?

  html: What if we add 50 brand new routers between 2 hosts, now if we try to ping
    will the first 50 packets will drop so that the ARP and DNS responses for 50 routers
    will take that much time??

    html: Well, if you&#39;d be running Cumulus Linux (or any other routing-over-Linux
      product) it would be a simple matter of writing a Python (or Perl) script.<br
      /><br />AFAIK there&#39;s no such option in traditional routers.

  html: Hey guys... Does anyone know how to configure a router(A) so it can send acopy
    of its arp table to another router(B)<br /><br />All hosts inside X subnet are
    pointing towards router A. I need to have that exact copy dynamically if possible
    in router B.<br /><br />Thanks!

    html: Hehe, thanks again for the valuable article then. I&#39;m just surprised
      to find so many answers about increasing the timeout delay whereas this is pointless
      since the request was dropped.

  html: 'Thanks for this article. This answers my problem: I send only one ping and
    I get a timeout even after increasing (a lot) the delay before the timeout (like
    some other articles suggest). In the captures, the ICMP request is not emitted
    at all after the ARP response.<br /><br />But what is your source? I cannot find
    any document on Cisco about this.'
