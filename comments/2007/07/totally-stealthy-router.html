            <div class="comment-content">First off, I'd like to say your blog rocks!!! I love it, thank you so much.<BR/><BR/>=)<BR/><BR/>I'd like to point out that I've been messing with the inspect rules -- and instead of useing tcp, udp and icmp statements, the 'ip' does all three. Just thought you could use that tidbit here. I also played with allowing specific ports <B>before</B> the inspect, it keeps those from being generated on the other side. (I have explicit allows in for a port both udp and tcp that I thought would be redundant in the inspect espeecially since there's tons of connections on those ports.)<BR/><BR/>The way you implemented it gives me a great idea on keeping things simple too. I had three lists set up where you have one and I think it'll trim down my fw. Thanks again!!!<BR/><BR/>-tommy.becker@gmail.com</div>
