  html: Hello - <BR/><BR/>Nice work...Inverse mask was the only option when configuring
    network statements under OSFP, both options were not always available.  I'm not
    real sure which IOS version Cisco introduced the new option.<BR/><BR/>Just thought
    to add the comments in case people do run into older versions.<BR/><BR/>Keep up
    the good work.

  html: Thanks for this article Ivan. Always knew there had to be a better way than
    using PBR tied to a Loopback to force CBAC inspection of the router originated
    traffic.

  html: Hi,<BR/><BR/> thanks for nice post, but i have two question.<BR/><BR/>1) Is
    there any chance to inspect L2L IPsec tunell which originate at the router. I
    know that i can inspect UDP by using "ip inspect name OUTSIDE-ROUTER udp router-traffic"
    but what about ESP?<BR/><BR/>2) How can i firewalling traffic which is  routed
    to IPsec VPN tunell?<BR/><BR/>Thanks for reply.

  html: 'You cannot inspect ESP traffic, you have to allow it explicitely in the inbound
    access list (access-list <I>Internet</I> in my example).<BR/><BR/>As for inspecting
    IPSec traffic: if you''re using crypto maps on the public interface, the traffic
    will have to pass the inspection and inbound access list anyway; if you''re using
    a protected tunnel interface, you can configure access list and <B>ip inspect</B>
    on the tunnel interface.'

  html: 'Hi there!<BR/>And thanks for all the info!<BR/><BR/>I found some problem
    with ip inspect and router originated tftp traffic.<BR/><BR/>I start a copy ru
    tftp: and I see that the CBAC opens that connection. But the tftp server does
    not respond from the same server port! thus, the ip inspect does not work here.<BR/><BR/>Example
    packets:<BR/>router: 10.0.0.1<BR/>tftp server: 10.0.0.2<BR/><BR/>udp 10.0.0.1:5423
    -&gt; 10.0.0.2:69<BR/>udp 10.0.0.2:3658 -&gt; 10.0.0.1:5423<BR/><BR/>See that?
    the tftp server response came from another port!<BR/>Any ideas how to fix this?<BR/><BR/>Thanks!'

  html: This is how TFTP works. You would need "ip inspect name X tftp router-traffic"
    but that does not exist.

    option for tftp protocol inspection.

  html: Hi, I also encountered a &quot;tftp&quot; similar problem when router was
    DNS server for the internal network. Ideal would have been a &quot;ip inspect
    name X dns router-traffic&quot; but it does not exist either. Fortunately, in
    this case, &quot;ip inspect name X udp router-traffic&quot; is enough.

    html: Looks like a bug to me. Known one? I wouldn&#39;t know. Anyway, here&#39;s
      how you might implement a workaround:<br /><br />http://blog.ipspace.net/2007/04/fix-router-configuration-after-reload.html

  html: Ivan I can&#39;t thank you enough for this article - I was going spare trying
    to configure for a small office WAN. I have a problem though when rebooting my
    Cisco 867 router. Essentially all inside NAT translations will not work until
    I do the following on the outside interface GigabitEthernet2<br /><br />no ip
    access-group Internet in<br />ip access-group Internet in<br /><br />It&#39;s
    like there is an ordering problem only resolved by deleting and reapplying the
    access-group. My interface definition looks like this - I&#39;ve checked the running-config
    and the boot up config and the order is identical:<br /><br />ip inspect name
    Internet-out icmp router-traffic<br />ip inspect name Internet-out tcp router-traffic<br
    />ip inspect name Internet-out udp router-traffic<br /><br />interface GigabitEthernet2<br
    /> description PrimaryWANDesc_iiNet NBN<br /> ip address dhcp<br /> ip access-group
    Internet in<br /> no ip unreachables<br /> ip inspect Internet-out out<br /> ip
    nat outside<br /> ip virtual-reassembly in<br /> duplex auto<br /> speed auto<br
    /> no cdp enable<br />!<br /><br />Any pointers? Is this some type of known bug?<br
    /><br /><br /><br />
