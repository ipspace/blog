  html: Actually, it has to be 192.168.0.0 :) ... although your suggestion will work
    as well. Fixed.

  html: To use dhcp conflict logging, doesn't one have to have a storage location
    configured?<BR/><BR/>I generally configure "no ip dhcp conflict logging" as the
    router will broadcast for a tftp server to put the file on if left default. Or
    at least so I've been told.<BR/><BR/>"router(config)#ip dhcp database ?<BR/>  WORD  Uniform
    Resource Locator (URL)"

  html: Hi All, <BR/><BR/> Is there any way to have some kind of redundancy between
    a windows dhcp server and a Cisco router ? <BR/><BR/> Thanks

  html: You can use the same trick to achieve router/Windows redundancy, just make
    sure you use two separate address ranges.

  html: hmm...I need to have the same scopes matinained in two routers.<br /><br />One
    rtr is pri/active and other is standby. we have same scopes in both of them.<br
    /><br />The service is running on the pri and not running on the sec. Only scopes
    have been created in sec and kept.<br /><br />When the pri goes down, we are unable
    start the service on the sec as it is....we have reboot the sec as well, only
    then we are able to get the serivce on the sec.<br /><br />not sure why we have
    to reboot the sec.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Naveen

  html: I think the easiest way to have redundant DHCP is pfsense or DHCP failover
    in Windows Server. Even though it makes sense to hake it, even gigantic networks
    have a lazy DHCP setup with no rogue DHCP protection or redundancy. <br />the
    IBM offices in Spain were brought down by some stray laptop that was running a
    DHCP server by accident. Yep. Believe it.
