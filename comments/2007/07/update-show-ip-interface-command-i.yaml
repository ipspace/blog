  html: great! works well here.<BR/><BR/>watch out if you're running 12.4(15)T on
    an 877 with the v5 IPS stuff configured - you'll get told "Not enough free memory
    to launch Tcl shell" (even with 256MB!), which is a shame.

  html: aha! thank you very much for that. I haven't yet been able to find any info
    on it on cisco's website, though - is there a default value, for instance?

  html: 'cos: it''s apparently 1/4 of the free processor memory when TCL gets initialized.  Open
    a TAC SR if this is a concern.'

  html: Ivan,<BR/><BR/>Just tried out this script and I've noticed that it insists
    on writing to the first tty no matter where it's executed from.<BR/><BR/>Example
    - I put the script in and setup the alias and it works fine.  I had a colleague
    login and when he executed the command, the output displayed on my tty.  Once
    I logged out, he had to logout and log back in for it to work on his terminal.<BR/><BR/>Also,
    is there a way to paginate the output?<BR/><BR/>Thanks for the great tip!<BR/>Roddie

  html: Minor correction - It seems to be writing to the first <I>line</I> not TTY.
