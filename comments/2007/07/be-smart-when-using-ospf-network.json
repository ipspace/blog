          "html": "You would use the more specific area advertisement to ensure that range makes it into the correct area. <br /><br />A couple of notes (not for Ivan, but to clarify his point)<br />1) The network command does not dictate anything about the LSA.  If your interface has a /28 mask and your network wildcard mask is equivalent to a /16 (with the ranges overlapping) the LSA will contain the /28.  If you have multiple interfaces that can be neatly summarized and they&#39;re all described by that /16 wildcard mask, the router will typically summarize and send out a summary LSA.<br /><br />2) The router organizes network statements from most to least specific regardless of how you type them.  A wildcard mask of 0.0.0.255 would always appear before a mask of 0.0.255.255 <br /><br />3) When the router is trying to decide which area to put an interface in, it iterates through the network statements like an ACL.  When it finds one that matches, it assigns that area and stops looking.<br /><br />So, in Ivan&#39;s #2 example, he used 10.1.16.0 0.0.15.255 area 3.   The reason he did this is because he probably has a less specific network statement to put everything else in area 0. Eg:  10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0.  In this case the Router would put the area 3 statement above the area 0 statement and any interfaces matching 10.1.16.0 0.0.15.255 would be put in area 3; everything else in area 0.<br /><br />Important! - Using broad area definitions can be a security hole.  The network statement causes an interface to become active on OSPF.  That means two things:  1) LSA&#39;s are generated for that interface (good) 2) The router starts sending Hello messages on that interface (not always good).   You should use the &quot;passive-interface default&quot; command in your OSPF configuration and then &quot;no passive-interface&quot; for every interface where you actually want an adjacency to form.
