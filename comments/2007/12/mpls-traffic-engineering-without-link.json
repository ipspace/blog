      "html": "Hi, Ivan.<BR/><BR/>Well, you actually <B>can</B> run MPLS TE without any link state IGP. The key is 'verbatim' option which is available in certain IOS versions.<BR/><BR/>I have blogged about it before (coincidently it was exactly one year ago): http://dbg.livejournal.com/50208.html<BR/><BR/>The blog antry is in Russian, and the google translation is less than adequate. Though the entry includes  a drawing and lots of configs and verification, so even if you don't read Russian well, it demonstrates enough. Or if you like, I can write a more sane translation to English than google produces.",

Currently this feature is only supported in Service Provider images (7200, 7600, Cat6K ...). Let's hope it will eventually leak into a more mainstream image ;)",

      "html": "yes you are right about Tunnel source it can be set to any address or unnumbered to interface but just of sake of sainty , normaly its configured to be Loopback interface used as IGP RID <BR/>so is there any feature always a router to have mutiple MPLS TE RID ?<BR/><BR/>i don't think so and in this case , parallel tunnels between same PE routers will use same tunnel destination but with different tunnel attributes according to the case",
