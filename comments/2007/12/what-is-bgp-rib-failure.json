      "html": "I have seen this before in some dual-homed sites where the customer also wanted the MPLS to backup his LAN to LAN traffic from within that site. We saw rib failures as well as the needs to tweak bgp weight on the CE routers in order to get the proper routing and failover scenarios the ways the customer wanted. However, the addition of rib failues definitely helped pinpointed the issues visually. W/o that feature one might need to dig deeper to find out what was going on.<BR/><BR/>Thanks for the clarifications on this feature.",

After i redistribute OSPF into BGP then the eBGP peer has a rib-failure about the connected interface , and the iBGP peers have rib-failures about the networks they allready knew through OSPF. This is normal because the routing table for both iBGP anf eBGP has allready these routes with better AD. Pings are doing fine and everything looks correct. My question is the fact that the routes are marked as rib-failure is a problem ? should or should not try to eliminate this entry from the bgp table? thank you",
