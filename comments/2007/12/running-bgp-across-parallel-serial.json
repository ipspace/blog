For example, if one of the circuits is behaving erratically and need to perform a series of ping packets to confirm, how can I control the ping to travel onto the same circuit and back?<BR/><BR/>Honestly this is a neat trick I must admit, but configuing it would require you to disable one serial interface before you can configure the same IP address on another serial interface or else IOS would complain that you have overlapping IP addresses on the box.",

When I lab this using physical interface, frame relay encapsulation, and frame relay maps cef does not load balance.<br /><br />However, when I create point-to-point subinterfaces it works identically to what you have described using frame relay encapsulation.<br /><br />It really is dependent on the interface being flagged as point-to-point :)",
