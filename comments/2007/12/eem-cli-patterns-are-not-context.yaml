  html: EEM 3.0 has an enhanced cli event detector that allows you to specify the
    mode of the command.  Unfortunately the mode values that you can use are not obvious
    and not documented.  However, there is a hidden command to see the modes - &#39;show
    parser mode&#39; - the name column lists the various parser modes.  Since it&#39;s
    a hidden command, use it at your own risk.
