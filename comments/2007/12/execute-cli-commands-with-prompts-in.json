I suspect the <B>pattern</B> keyword was introduced very recently.<BR/><BR/>I always try to mention the release when a feature I'm writing about was first introduced based on CCO IOS documentation. I also believe writing about other exciting features is worth more than doing reverse-engineering to figure out in which IOS release Cisco introduced undocumented features ... and I really appreciate the release-specific comments you're making, as they help us all figure out approximately when these beasts were coded.",
