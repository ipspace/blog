  html: 'Hi, Ivan.<BR/><BR/>Well, you actually <B>can</B> run MPLS TE without any
    link state IGP. The key is ''verbatim'' option which is available in certain IOS
    versions.<BR/><BR/>I have blogged about it before (coincidently it was exactly
    one year ago): http://dbg.livejournal.com/50208.html<BR/><BR/>The blog antry is
    in Russian, and the google translation is less than adequate. Though the entry
    includes  a drawing and lots of configs and verification, so even if you don''t
    read Russian well, it demonstrates enough. Or if you like, I can write a more
    sane translation to English than google produces.'

  html: Thanks for the information. I was quickly able to find the link to <A HREF="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps1829/products_feature_guide09186a0080699540.html"
    REL="nofollow">verbatim path support</A> in your entry. Currently this feature
    is only supported in Service Provider images (7200, 7600, Cat6K ...). Let's hope
    it will eventually leak into a more mainstream image ;)

  html: Hi Ivan <BR/><BR/>and i think that also implies that Tunnel source and destination
    must be IGP/TE Router-ID<BR/>i tried many OSPF/ISIS MPLS TE labs and it never
    comes up unless spesificing MPLS TE RID to be the same as IGP RID and use RID
    as tunnel source and destination <BR/><BR/>i think that is what cisco called Topology
    database verification

  html: '@Janitor: You''re absolutely correct. Not sure about the tunnel source, but
    the destination has to be the MPLS TE RID of the tunnel tail-end router.'

  html: yes you are right about Tunnel source it can be set to any address or unnumbered
    to interface but just of sake of sainty , normaly its configured to be Loopback
    interface used as IGP RID <BR/>so is there any feature always a router to have
    mutiple MPLS TE RID ?<BR/><BR/>i don't think so and in this case , parallel tunnels
    between same PE routers will use same tunnel destination but with different tunnel
    attributes according to the case
