  html: '"always overloaded TAC" : you just broke the TAC NDA !! :-) <BR/><BR/>There
    are free and open alternatives to our internal tools. Just use scapy instead of
    pagent/tgn for example.'

  html: I never got a documentation marked "confidential" saying TAC is overloaded
    :))<BR/><BR/>Thanks for the Scapy link, looks like a really useful tool. We wanted
    to use PCs for packet generators in remote labs for quite a while, but somehow
    never found time to investigate the tools out there. Any idea what a suitable
    replacement for callgen might be?<BR/><BR/>On the negative side, looks like I'll
    have yet another scripting language to learn. I though PERL, ASP, PHP and Tcl
    would be enough ... but scapy is written in Python :((

  html: A TCL based packet generation tool is available and is called netexpect.  As
    the name suggests it's basically expect for packets.  I.e. you send a packet and
    expect a response.  Unfortunately the wiki is currently down for "repairs" but
    you can get the source which has examples and documentation from here:<BR/><BR/>http://www.netexpect.org/downloads/

  html: Something that would be VERY interesting would be if someone figured out TCL
    for it....Then you could run it on any cisco router.

  html: '@Anonymous(last): You couldn''t generate significant traffic load using Tcl
    on the router. Furthermore, baseline Tcl (as ported to IOS) supports only TCP
    sessions, you need host-specific binary libraries to send UDP packets or raw IP
    packets.'
