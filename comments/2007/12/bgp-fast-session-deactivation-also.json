      "html": "Okay, my memory was fading. It was actually 120 seconds as per RFC 1771. The BGP timer name was \"BGP ConnectRetry timer\" and it's set to 120 seconds by default in the IOS and cannot be changed. See the below exceprt taken from CCO:<BR/><BR/>Q. What is the default BGP ConnectRetry timer, and is it possible to tune the BGP ConnectRetry timer? <BR/><BR/>A. The default BGP ConnectRetry timer is 120 seconds. Only after this time passes does the BGP process check to see if the passive TCP session is established. If the passive TCP session is not established, then the BGP process starts a new active TCP attempt to connect to the remote BGP speaker. During this idle 120 seconds of the ConnectRetry timer, the remote BGP peer can establish a BGP session to it. Presently, the Cisco IOS ConnectRetry timer cannot be changed from its default of 120 seconds. <BR/><BR/>The URL is here:<BR/><BR/>http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_q_and_a_item09186a00800949e8.shtml#twenty-two",
