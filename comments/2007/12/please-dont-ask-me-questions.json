      "html": "I never got a documentation marked \"confidential\" saying TAC is overloaded :))<BR/><BR/>Thanks for the Scapy link, looks like a really useful tool. We wanted to use PCs for packet generators in remote labs for quite a while, but somehow never found time to investigate the tools out there. Any idea what a suitable replacement for callgen might be?<BR/><BR/>On the negative side, looks like I'll have yet another scripting language to learn. I though PERL, ASP, PHP and Tcl would be enough ... but scapy is written in Python :((",
