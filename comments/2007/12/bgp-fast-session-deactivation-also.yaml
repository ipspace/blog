  html: Hi!<BR/><BR/>Is there a difference between the "(no) neighbor x.y.z fall-over"
    and the "(no) bgp fast-external-fallover" (except that the first one is for neighbors
    and the second one globally)?

  html: sebastian,<BR/><BR/>I believe the "(no) neighbor x.y.z fall-over" applies
    to iBGP sessions (BGP sessions established to a neighbor in the same AS) and "(no)
    bgp fast-external-fallover" applies only to EBGP sessions (BGP sessions established
    to a neighbor with a different AS).

  html: That's an interesting discovery, Ivan. I looked at a RFC before (didn't remember
    the number) and it said it normally would take 60 seconds to initiate the BGP
    session to a peer. I will post again after I found the RFC...

  html: Okay, my memory was fading. It was actually 120 seconds as per RFC 1771. The
    BGP timer name was "BGP ConnectRetry timer" and it's set to 120 seconds by default
    in the IOS and cannot be changed. See the below exceprt taken from CCO:<BR/><BR/>Q.
    What is the default BGP ConnectRetry timer, and is it possible to tune the BGP
    ConnectRetry timer? <BR/><BR/>A. The default BGP ConnectRetry timer is 120 seconds.
    Only after this time passes does the BGP process check to see if the passive TCP
    session is established. If the passive TCP session is not established, then the
    BGP process starts a new active TCP attempt to connect to the remote BGP speaker.
    During this idle 120 seconds of the ConnectRetry timer, the remote BGP peer can
    establish a BGP session to it. Presently, the Cisco IOS ConnectRetry timer cannot
    be changed from its default of 120 seconds. <BR/><BR/>The URL is here:<BR/><BR/>http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_q_and_a_item09186a00800949e8.shtml#twenty-two

  html: Thanks for all the comments ... it looks I've opened another can of worms.
    Obviously a good topic for another IP Corner article ;)

  html: Whenever you want to know which trains include a specific command (6500 and
    7600's have dedicated release trains), check the command reference. <A HREF="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/iproute/command/reference/irp_bgp3.html#wp1013842"
