  html: Hello, Ivan!<BR/><BR/>I have also tried recently (last week) to delete the
    startup-config from a Cisco 837 router who had the "no service password-recovery"
    feature activated, but there was no way whatsoever to send BREAK to the poor thing.<BR/><BR/>Unfortunately
    the NVRAM is emulated in flash memory (onboard, ofcourse) so i couldn't erase
    it.<BR/><BR/>I have also tried setting a jumper on all possible positions on the
    10 motherboard pair of pins but it still loaded the startup-config from the NVRAM
    :)<BR/><BR/>Regards,

  html: I assumed you opened a service request with Cisco for that issue, right Ivan
    ? :)<BR/>Interesting. I have some devices that should support the "no service
    password-recovery" functionality. I'll give it a try and report back the results.

  html: the bug (break being ignored after IOS is booted) seems to manifest because
    IOS checks for the break only in the first 5 seconds when the IOS is initialized.<BR/><BR/>it
    seems that this process (ios init) takes more than 5 seconds on some platforms/images
    (roughly 6 seconds on 837 ;-) and the break arrives too late.<BR/><BR/>the cisco
    workaround was to increase this interval to 10 seconds in newer images.<BR/><BR/>i
    guess you just need to RMA the affected router, if you have no access to enable...

  html: This is something that I ran into with a router I bough on ebay ... I solved
    my issue by removing the NVRAM chip from the router which forces it to boot in
    ROM MON, then changed the confreg, then put the NVRAM chip back in, and not only
    did I have a password recovery, I was able to pull the entire config from the
    previous Co-Lo that was on the router.

  html: I haven't opened a case (the whole TAC thread was a joke ;). In my case, it
    would have been a theoretical question (I didn't have a locked-up router) and
    I would not want to waste TAC engineers' time, I guess there are plenty of other
    people doing that already.

  html: I have a Cisco 1841 and nothing I can do will reset the password.<BR/><BR/>All
    the breaks in the world, right after the image loads, before it every other time
    you can imagine.<BR/><BR/>I am going down two avenues:<BR/><BR/>1. Find out which
    chip on the mother board is the NVRAM and physically unsolder it.<BR/><BR/>2.
    Write my own IOS that when loaded erases the NVRAM.<BR/><BR/>Both options will
    probably result in the box being a doorstop for the rest of eternity :-)

  html: 'There''s a procedure used to "unbrick" some Linksys routers running Linux.<BR/><BR/>It
    involves shorting a couple of pins of the onboard flash, rendering it unusable.  The
    router can then be accessed via its recovery mechanism.<BR/><BR/>I wonder if something
    similar couldn''t be tried here?  Ground a pin that''s critical for reading NVRAM?<BR/><BR/>Obviously
    there is some risk, but if you''re starting with an unusable router anyway...<BR/><BR/>And
    it''s certainly preferable to unsoldering!<BR/><BR/>The Linksys procedure can
    be found by googling: wrt "pin 15 and 16"'

      the previous owner left on the device. You should always erase the nvram before
      excessing as this command does not really secure it.

    depending on your serial port/console client setup.

  html: I had a similar problem with a Cisco 1803 today. It had IOS 12.3 on it. There
    was no way to get into ROMMON-mode (break did not work). I started it with another
    flash card with IOS 15.1 for 1800-series on it. The nvram was apparently unreadable
    for this IOS version, so it &quot;reformatted&quot; it for me. Booting again with
    the original flash-card showed me that the NVRAM was indeed reset to empty, and
    I rescued my eBay bargain... ;-)

  html: Getting into rommon is Easy on my 2811.  However if I change the confreg and
    reset, the router just boots over and over, I can never get past that.  Getting
    into rommon is easy, but changing the register results in a total failure to boot.  The
    password recovery procedure does not work for me at all...  I&#39;ve had to recover
    hundreds of ciscos for the last 20 years, but this is the first time I have failed.

  html: It&#39;s all to do with your Console connectivity. Using a USB-Serial converter
    didn&#39;t work for me. I had to dig out an old PC from the basement and use the
    cisco console cable direct to the com port. Worked first time then. When logged
    in (no pwd), I ran the service password-recovery command and rebooted my C2811.
    All fixed.
