  html: A good use of GRE keepalive is to monitor a metro ethernet link between two
    routers. You setup a GRE tunnel with keepalive between two Ethernet endpoints
    to monitor true end-to-end connectivity over the metro Ethernet link. Keep in
    mind though you are not sending user traffic through the GRE tunnel, merely you
    are using the GRE keepalive as a health indicator of the metro Ethernet connection.
    Of course this will not be needed once Ethernet OAM, E-LMI, etc, have become widely
    available, but for the time being I find the GRE keepalive has other good uses
    besides tunneling traffic.

  html: That's definitely an interesting suggestion. But when you know that the end-to-end
    link is down, what do you do with that information? I have a few crazy ideas,
    but would like to hear from you first.

  html: We use standard NMS (HP Opeview, CA Spectrum, etc) to monitor customer devices.
    GRE Tunnel itself is just an other interface to these NMS systems, therefore if
    the tunnel went down the interface would become RED and an alarm will be triggered.
    Without this "indicator" tunnel interface we will have no way of knowing that
    the end-to-end path was actually down somewhere along the path. We have thought
    about using traps or monitoring routing neighbors logging, etc, but nothing beats
    the reliable tunnel interface Up/Down. This method has allowed us to open ticket
    proactively with the Metro Ethernet provider to resolve the issue. Keep in mind
    that the physical Ethernet interface itself could be UP/UP on the customer router,
    which isn't a reliable indicator.

  html: Hi ... very nice point. But, how to identify where's the problem path, when
    we find the Tunnel is flap, but all interface along the circuit is up (never down).
    Thanks !

  html: The only tool that comes to my mind is the "traceroute" command.

  html: Hi Ivan. The problem is the circuit is L2 based, and this circuit consist  of
    many physical hop. I have checked all log and there's no problem with physical
    log. Thks.

  html: If you have L2 devices in the path that you don't control, there's no way
    to figure out where the problem is (in a few years, you might be able to use Ethernet
    OAM :).

  html: Not to mention VRFs where the keepalive is inside the VRF and not in the transit
    VRF (or default table if that be the case)

  html: Thanks, Ivan, for the good explanation. Using an inbound ACL on the tunnel
    interface can defeat the keepalive if the tunneled packet is GRE and you only
    allow IP. Also, troubleshooting is more difficult since the tunnel interface is
    up/up with the ACL.  For example ...  <br />  <br />Side A with keepalives and
    ACL    ... up/up.  <br />Side B with keepalives and no ACL ... up/down.  <br />  <br
    />Neither side can ping the remote end. Remove the keepalives and everything works.  <br
    />  <br />In response to William using GRE to monitor Metro Ethernet, you could
    use BFD which will take down the Ethernet interface if the end-to-end connectivity
    fails.  Thanks, Tom.

  html: i have a similar problem. the GRE tunnel was working fine until the internet
    link failed. when it came back the GRE tunnel does not established. what could
    be the problem

  html: And along came IOS XE 3.1.0S which says in the release notes:<br /><br />http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_restrictions.html#wp3021511<br
    /><br />&quot;GRE Keepalive with Tunnel Protection <br /><br />The Cisco ASR 1000
    Series Router supports GRE keepalive with tunnel protection. However, the keepalive
    packet that is returned is not encrypted. &quot;<br /><br />A friendly TAC engineer
    undug this from the ASR1K release notes, when I opened a case for a pair of ISR
    4451-X (3.10.01S) which surprisingly worked very well with GRE keepalives on a
    protected GRE-o-IPSec tunnel.
