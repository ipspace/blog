However, I noticed that the router ID doesn't change even after 'clear ip ospf [process_id] process'.<BR/><BR/>Neighbors still report the original ID, as does 'show ip ospf'.<BR/><BR/>This was observed on a 3725 running 12.2(15)T14 and a 3560G running 12.2(25r)SE1, so the change may only apply in more recent code.",

If router id is derived from router-id command, than change of router-id command and clear ip ospf process will change router-id. Thank for hint!",
