      "html": "[quote]<BR/>Although the router allows you to configure distribute-list acl in interface, it does not work. Routes received through that interface (or having the interface as the next-hop) are not filtered.<BR/>[/quote]<BR/>The distribute list doesn't work with OSPF because the router is not receiving information about networks, but about link states. <BR/>As you have mentioned, if there would be a way to change this behavior (filter the link states) then it could cause routing problems (route hole, etc.). With OSPF every router in the area has to have the same knowledge about links and they have to compute with the SPF algorithm the same path (or tree).",

The same for the external from the NSSA. By the way, probably I did something wrong before from the distance command for NSSA ABR because I have tested again and now it works :)",

      "html": "Ivan: It is true that distribute-list in filters the prefixes from the route table and not the LSAs from the database, but I would say that this is not 100% accurate.<br />There are 2 exceptions from what I have seen doing some tests:<br /><br />- Applied on an ABR, it will filter the prefixes specified in the ACL from entering the route table, plus the LSAs type 3 to enter the area which is attached. Let&#39;s say that ABR is connected to Area-1, and it has type 3 of Area 2, it will filter those to enter Area-1. By the way, the distance 255 will do the same. <br />- Applied on an ABR attached to a NSSA, it will filter the prefixes specified plus sending the type 5 LSAs to the Backbone. To be accurate, this has to be done on the ABR which is doing the translation of Type-7 to Type-5. This router will be the ABR with the highest router-ID according to NSSA RFC 1587. Here the distance command does not work to filter the LSA&#39;s.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Jose.",
