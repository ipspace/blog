  html: That's crazy, IMHO.<BR/>I think the reason SOME people still don't want to
    run a routing protocol in the firewall isn't a technical/security one - but a
    trust issue/political issue/who does what issue.<BR/>We know that in past times
    (not so long, and still being done) the network guys were in charge of the routers/switches/etc,
    while the security folks were in charge of the firewall/IDS/VPN devices, etc.
    And neither group trusted each other - and heck, for sure the security folks wouldn't
    trust any route they got from the network folks. "Gimme a default to rule them
    all" - very Tolkien - was SECOPS approach.<BR/>And it isn't a security concern
    at all. Heck, I've seen BIG customers running RIP on their CHKP firewalls - without
    even plain text authentication. So don't give me the security excuse ;)<BR/>So
    let's see the pros and cons of using OSPF on the firewall vs static routes:<BR/>*
    using OSPF allows the firewall to actually react to network topology changes -
    both internal _and_ external. Specially relevant in HA scenarios<BR/>* the static
    routes don't allow for dynamic changes - not to mention they're a PITA to maintain.
    I've seen more than once people getting "cut off" the Internet 'cause someone
    changed the Internet facing router, did some addressing changes - but SNAFU, the
    firewall folks weren't notified, or were, but they didn't apply the change<BR/>*
    security-wise, running OSPF with MD5 authentication should be good enuf to leave
    bogus routing updates out. And as you yourself say - if someone was to get control
    of the router in front of the firewall, all bets are off - no matter if using
    OSPF or static routing. Heck, if *I* was to get control of that router, I wouldn't
    mess with the routing at all - I *want* for the traffic to come my way, so I can
    do something like policy routing, and shoot the traffic I'm interested in down
    a GRE tunnel to a remote place where I can capture, analyze, on-the-fly modify
    and reinject.<BR/><BR/>It is, IMHO, once again the problem of "not doing the risk
    assesment right". If anyone actually sat down and DID the risk assesment/value
    proposition of sticking to the '80s and using static routes vs joining us all
    in 2007 and doing OSPF . . . <BR/><BR/>And on top of that - if the firewall is
    doing a "default-information originate", it would be better to also have a sinkhole
    on the internal network doing the same - with a higher metric - so if the default
    on the firewall was to dissapear because the Internet-facing router went down,
    traffic wouldn't go to the firewall - but to the sinkhole, where it could be sent
    to null0 - and everyone's now happy.<BR/><BR/>Or if you don't want to transport
    the traffic all the way to the sinkhole, just to drop it, do the good old "remote
    triggered blackhole routing" over BGP.<BR/>Come on - there are many ways to skin
    this particular cat. Sticking to "no routing protocol on the firewall" it only
    shows whoever says so doesn't know his business.

  html: Ivan, I see some discrepance between your statement "you can't filter routing
    updates in OSPF" and the docs at http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6350/products_configuration_guide_chapter09186a00804556f4.html
    - may you explain it a bit more?

  html: '@anonymous: That''s available in IOS, not in PIX/ASA, which is a few releases
    behind IOS in OSPF functionality.<BR/><BR/>@BlueDemon: I guess we agree to disagree
    :) As you''ve said, &ldquo;<I>I think the reason SOME people still don''t want
    to run a routing protocol in the firewall isn''t a technical/security one - but
    a trust issue/political issue/who does what issue.</I>&rdquo; &hellip; and I agree
    with you completely, but I disagree with the security implications. <BR/><BR/>Your
    statement that &ldquo;<I>Heck, I''ve seen BIG customers running RIP on their CHKP
    firewalls - without even plain text authentication.</I>&rdquo; is also true, but
    that does not necessarily imply that what they''re doing is secure, only that
    they feel it''s secure enough for them (or haven''t been bitten yet). If someone
    big or important is doing something, that doesn''t mean it''s a smart thing to
    do.<BR/><BR/>I also mostly agree with your statements about static vs. dynamic
    routing (I am absolutely not a proponent of static routes, as you probably know
    :).<BR/><BR/>However (and I will not go any deeper), there is a good reason someone
    a long time (probably <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_in_depth"
    REL="nofollow">hundreds of years</A>) ago started talking about <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_Depth_(computing)"
    REL="nofollow">defense in depth</A>. If you link your external router and your
    firewall, you''ve just weakened your second line of defense. Whether that''s important
    enough or negligible is a personal opinion (and here''s where we differ).<BR/><BR/>Other
    than that, thanks for a great comment ;)'

  html: Although this is a nice trick to get OSPF peering to work "across" the PIX/ASA,
    however this leaves the PIX/ASA in the dark as far as how and when to route/re-route
    traffic out via different interfaces. Any routing changes on the outside or inside
    router will not be seen by the PIX/ASA, thus the firewall can potentially blackhole
    the traffic.<BR/><BR/>Cisco had gone great length to implement OSPF and EIGRP
    on these smart firewalls so we should enable routing protocols to allow the firewall
    to make smart routing decision when routing change occurs.

  html: Hey, Ivan:<BR/><BR/>My comment about RIP was meant as an example of "how to
    do the right thing the wrong way". I was speechless when I saw that - and I had
    to take a couple deep breaths - I was about to blurb "this rates about 11 on the
    1-to-10 scale of moronic" ;)<BR/><BR/>And I spent a couple more mins thinking
    about this while walking the dog (mind-numbing task if there's such a thing).
    static routing from the firewall to the internal network, or a static default
    from the internal network pointing to the firewall brings an interesting concept/idea
    to the table - whoever is doing that trust s the ARP protocol more than OSPF with
    MD5 ;)<BR/><BR/>Sooner or later, someone (router or firewall) will need to ARP
    for the other guy MAC - good time then to do some ARP spoofing and redirect traffic.<BR/><BR/>yeah,
    yeah, needs L2 access - I would bet getting said L2 access would be easier than
    compromising the router/firewall to change routing - all things being equal, and
    asumming a password != 'cisco' on any device ;)

  html: I tried running OSPF between 2 routers across a firewall, by establshing a
    GRE tunnel and running OSPF through it. This takes care of the Hello packets (they
    have a TTL of 1) also.<BR/><BR/>The only hitch is that the firewall must support
    the pass-through of GRE.<BR/><BR/>I was also looking for a solution to run the
    OSPF across a fiewwall without using a GRE tunnel. One can configure the connected
    interfaces (with the firewall in between behaving like a router) not to broadcast
    (in our case multicast) OSPF. But then this stops the Hello packets also.<BR/><BR/>Is
    there any way to sort of unicast the Hello packets across the Firewall? And to
    increase the TTL of Hello packets to more than 1?
