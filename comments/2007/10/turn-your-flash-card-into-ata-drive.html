            <div class="comment-content">Just an FYI, I tried once to use a CF card-to-PCMCIA adapter on a 1602 router to see if the router would see it.  The router kicked out an error indicating there was something missing (I assume there is a special IC in the Cisco-approved PCMCIA flash cards) and kicked out an error and froze - no boot, nothing.  It isn't entirely related to the post but should show the older Cisco gear appears to have some specific requirements for flash used on the devices that newer gear (x800s, etc) doesn't.</div>
