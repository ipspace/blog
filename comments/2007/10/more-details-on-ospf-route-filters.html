            <div class="comment-content">As a side note, Cisco introduced an OSPF ABR Type 3 LSA filter between area routers. I have not tested this feature but from the documentation it seems to be workable.<BR/><BR/>http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios124/124cg/hirp_c/ch15/habrt3f.htm</div>

            <div class="comment-content">[quote]<BR/>Although the router allows you to configure distribute-list acl in interface, it does not work. Routes received through that interface (or having the interface as the next-hop) are not filtered.<BR/>[/quote]<BR/>The distribute list doesn't work with OSPF because the router is not receiving information about networks, but about link states. <BR/>As you have mentioned, if there would be a way to change this behavior (filter the link states) then it could cause routing problems (route hole, etc.). With OSPF every router in the area has to have the same knowledge about links and they have to compute with the SPF algorithm the same path (or tree).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">@Ivan: I am not so annoyed with the distribute-list command under the OSPF configuration. But yeah, it's pretty useless. More I am annoyed of the lack of an interface level command to add an IP address in this format:<BR/><B><I>ip address 10.1.1.1</I> /24</B><BR/>I hope that some future IOS versions will finally implement it :-)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">My understanding is that the distribute list in command does work, but not the way you think...Instead, it allows LSA's to be accepted, but it treats the interface that it is applied to as the criteria to filter incoming LSA's against in the next-hop field.<BR/><BR/>It works this way, if I apply it to my fa0/0 interface, and I have an LSA sent in that specifies fa0/0 as the interface thru which that prefix is reachable, it will prevent that route from being installed into the routing table.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan: It is true that distribute-list in filters the prefixes from the route table and not the LSAs from the database, but I would say that this is not 100% accurate.<br />There are 2 exceptions from what I have seen doing some tests:<br /><br />- Applied on an ABR, it will filter the prefixes specified in the ACL from entering the route table, plus the LSAs type 3 to enter the area which is attached. Let&#39;s say that ABR is connected to Area-1, and it has type 3 of Area 2, it will filter those to enter Area-1. By the way, the distance 255 will do the same. <br />- Applied on an ABR attached to a NSSA, it will filter the prefixes specified plus sending the type 5 LSAs to the Backbone. To be accurate, this has to be done on the ABR which is doing the translation of Type-7 to Type-5. This router will be the ABR with the highest router-ID according to NSSA RFC 1587. Here the distance command does not work to filter the LSA&#39;s.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Jose.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Good point. It seems Cisco IOS behaves almost like it would do the inter-LSA information transfer through the IP routing table not within the OSPF database. Need to run a test or two to confirm ...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Indeed. It looks like the same behavior for the NSSA ABR. If you config a static route matching the type 3 LSA, it will not advertise it due to the better AD. The same for the external from the NSSA. By the way, probably I did something wrong before from the distance command for NSSA ABR because I have tested again and now it works :)</div>
