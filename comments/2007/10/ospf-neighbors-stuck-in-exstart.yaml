  html: I have got an interesting one.<BR/><BR/>A few years ago I got called to troubleshoot
    an OSPF Exstart problem, Both routers were connected together over an international
    frame relay PVC. Both side had MTU 1500 bytes set on their interfaces initially
    but OSPF got stuck in Exstart. I knew about the OSPF MTU Mismatch issue back then
    but this one didn't seem to be it because the MTU size match on both ends. However,
    I was told it was an international Frame Relay PVC so I asked how the PVC was
    built. It actually went through three providers, and the provider in the middle
    had the PVC mtu set at 1100 bytes for some reasons and that was the culprit. The
    fix, as it turned out, was to lower the interface IP MTU on the customer routers
    (IP MTU = 1024)because the ospf mtu-ignore bit didn't solve it (this was because
    the middle Frame Relay provider dropped the over-sized frames at layer 2). It
    was a very unique problem so I would like to pass along. Nowadays frame relay
    is going away so we may never encounter a problem like this one.

  html: The place I've seen this several times is when running OSPF between a SVI
    on a 3550 switch and a router, which have different default MTUs.

  html: What is the best way (not "ip ospf mtu-ignore") to resolve MTU mismatch between
    3550 SVI and router's physical or BVI interface?<BR/><BR/>Without affecting other
    switch ports?<BR/><BR/>I know about "system mtu routing ..." on 3550, but it is
    system-wide.<BR/><BR/>Consider that router has BVI interface (which also produces
    different mtu) and switch has a SVI int.<BR/><BR/>Router:<BR/><BR/>bridge 1 protocol
    ieee<BR/>bridge 1 route ip<BR/>bridge irb<BR/><BR/>interface GigabitEthernet0/0<BR/>
    description trunk to 3750<BR/> no ip address<BR/>!         <BR/>interface GigabitEthernet0/0.1<BR/>
    encapsulation dot1Q 100<BR/> bridge-group 1  <BR/><BR/>interface BVI1<BR/> ip
    address 10.1.1.2 255.255.255.0<BR/><BR/>router ospf 1<BR/> network 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255
    area 0<BR/><BR/>BVI1 is up, line protocol is up<BR/>    MTU is 1514 bytes

  html: <A HREF="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/cisco/nsp/43854" REL="nofollow">According
    to this discussion</A>, you can only set system-wide MTU on 3550, not per interface.<BR/><BR/>Once
    I get my hands on a Catalyst switch (and have time to spare), I'll run a few tests.

  html: Thank you.<BR/>So should I set "system mtu routing 1514" on the 3750 to match
    the bvi's mtu and forget about it?<BR/><BR/>Any negative consequences?<BR/><BR/>What
    about other routers on the same L2 segment with regular routed intefaces? they
    currently have "ip ospf mtu-ignore" :)<BR/><BR/>The bvi interface would not take
    mtu settings.<BR/> <BR/>Thanks,<BR/>Vladimir

  html: You should set the system MTU to 1500, not 1514 (unless I'm gravely mistaken,
    the MTU specifies the payload size, not the layer-2 frame size).<BR/><BR/>There
    SHOULD be no negative impact, unless the workstations in your LAN use jumbo frames
    (and let's assume that the switches are not MPLS PE routers :).<BR/><BR/>As for
    the BVI interface; I can set the MTU and IP MTU on a BVI interface on a router
    (using 12.4(15)T1), but as I said in a previous comment, you cannot set per-interface
    MTU on a Cat3550 at all.

  html: Google got me here with the magic words mtu + ospf while looking for some
    info regarding this topic for a post in my new blog. I basically wrote the same
    (in spanish), but added something that I found pretty interesting; lowering back
    the mtu or removing the ip ospf mtu-ignore and see what would happen. Just the
    latter would bring us back to the issue. MTU would just be an issue again whenever
    the adjacency is rebuilt...just my two cents.

  html: Yeh, got a strange issue.<br /><br />If the MTU is set to 1500 or lower then
    full adjacency is achieved, anything higher and it stays in 2 way - Anyone got
    any ideas on that.<br /><br />Set up is - Juniper -&gt; Foundry -&gt; SmartEdge<br
    /><br />Set ups on Juniper and Smartedge as follows:-<br /><br />Juniper<br />metric
    65535;<br />        retransmit-interval 5;<br />        transit-delay 1;<br />        hello-interval
    10;<br />        dead-interval 40;<br /><br />SmartEdge:<br /><br />transmit-delay
    1<br />    router-priority 0<br />    hello-interval 10<br />    router-dead-interval
    40<br />    cost 65534<br /><br />The only difference I can see is the metric
    cost, but then why would it work with 1500 but not anything larger?

  html: Funny enough I&#39;m experiencing this issue right now on a Gigabit Ethernet
    link between two 7609s. Looks like the MTU on the transport network is wrong and
    the carrier is looking at it now.<br /><br />New technology, same old problems.  :)

  html: hi Robin, im experiencing it right now. i have two routers between two 7609
    and sometimes the ospf is going down. how did you resolve the issue?

    html: Duplicate IPs (particularly if they&#39;re used for Router ID) could be
      the root cause of your problems.

    html: I agree, that is why I am going through the configs of all the devices on
      the network very carefully. I didn&#39;t build or design this network, but I
      can sure make it work better and redesign what I can to even improve the original
      design

  html: 'I am having an issue with OSPF, we have HP, Cisco, and H3C in our Area 0.
    Router priorities are set, remote sites are priority 0 and the main sites are
    250 and lower (to specify DR). However, intermittently we are still getting some
    strange adjacency losses. <br />This started with an existing network that I am
    trying to fix. Originally no priorities were set anywhere and all Area 0 routers
    were set to priority 1 (default). I fixed that and the problem became MORE common
    - it had been happening once or twice every 3 months. <br /> I discovered then
    that the NTP server config on all the network equipment was inconsistent. So I
    fixed that, pointed all devices to the appropriate NTP servers (One of which was
    the loopback on our core router which had and IP that already existed on the BDR
    as the router ID). Finally yesterday for the first time in 10 days there were
    no OSPF messages of adj change in the logs. <br />All devices have identical MTU,Hello,
    Dead, and Carrier delay timers. <br /><br /> My questions are:<br />What affect
    did NTP have on OSPF? Could all the issues have been resolved by finding that
    duplicate IP in Area 0? Has anyone else seen issues with this type of mixed environment
    (HP, Cisco, H3C)? '
