  html: As a side note, Cisco introduced an OSPF ABR Type 3 LSA filter between area
    routers. I have not tested this feature but from the documentation it seems to
    be workable.<BR/><BR/>http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios124/124cg/hirp_c/ch15/habrt3f.htm

  html: '[quote]<BR/>Although the router allows you to configure distribute-list acl
    in interface, it does not work. Routes received through that interface (or having
    the interface as the next-hop) are not filtered.<BR/>[/quote]<BR/>The distribute
    list doesn''t work with OSPF because the router is not receiving information about
    networks, but about link states. <BR/>As you have mentioned, if there would be
    a way to change this behavior (filter the link states) then it could cause routing
    problems (route hole, etc.). With OSPF every router in the area has to have the
    same knowledge about links and they have to compute with the SPF algorithm the
    same path (or tree).'

  html: '@William: how did you know that the inter-area filters were close to the
    top of my OSPF to-do list :)<BR/><BR/>@Jozef: Conceptually we''re saying the same
    thing, I''m just annoyed that the <B>distribute-list interface</B> command is
    there but does not work at all, while the <B>distribute-list gateway</B> command
    works (although not the way I would expect it to work, but then you can''t be
    picky with undocumented commands, can you?)'

  html: '@Ivan: I am not so annoyed with the distribute-list command under the OSPF
    configuration. But yeah, it''s pretty useless. More I am annoyed of the lack of
    an interface level command to add an IP address in this format:<BR/><B><I>ip address
    10.1.1.1</I> /24</B><BR/>I hope that some future IOS versions will finally implement
    it :-)'

  html: My understanding is that the distribute list in command does work, but not
    the way you think...Instead, it allows LSA's to be accepted, but it treats the
    interface that it is applied to as the criteria to filter incoming LSA's against
    in the next-hop field.<BR/><BR/>It works this way, if I apply it to my fa0/0 interface,
    and I have an LSA sent in that specifies fa0/0 as the interface thru which that
    prefix is reachable, it will prevent that route from being installed into the
    routing table.

    html: Good point. It seems Cisco IOS behaves almost like it would do the inter-LSA
      information transfer through the IP routing table not within the OSPF database.
      Need to run a test or two to confirm ...

    html: Indeed. It looks like the same behavior for the NSSA ABR. If you config
      a static route matching the type 3 LSA, it will not advertise it due to the
      better AD. The same for the external from the NSSA. By the way, probably I did
      something wrong before from the distance command for NSSA ABR because I have
      tested again and now it works :)

  html: 'Ivan: It is true that distribute-list in filters the prefixes from the route
    table and not the LSAs from the database, but I would say that this is not 100%
    accurate.<br />There are 2 exceptions from what I have seen doing some tests:<br
    /><br />- Applied on an ABR, it will filter the prefixes specified in the ACL
    from entering the route table, plus the LSAs type 3 to enter the area which is
    attached. Let&#39;s say that ABR is connected to Area-1, and it has type 3 of
    Area 2, it will filter those to enter Area-1. By the way, the distance 255 will
    do the same. <br />- Applied on an ABR attached to a NSSA, it will filter the
    prefixes specified plus sending the type 5 LSAs to the Backbone. To be accurate,
    this has to be done on the ABR which is doing the translation of Type-7 to Type-5.
    This router will be the ABR with the highest router-ID according to NSSA RFC 1587.
    Here the distance command does not work to filter the LSA&#39;s.<br /><br />Best
    Regards,<br /><br />Jose.'
