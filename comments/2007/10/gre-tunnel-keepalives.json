      "html": "A good use of GRE keepalive is to monitor a metro ethernet link between two routers. You setup a GRE tunnel with keepalive between two Ethernet endpoints to monitor true end-to-end connectivity over the metro Ethernet link. Keep in mind though you are not sending user traffic through the GRE tunnel, merely you are using the GRE keepalive as a health indicator of the metro Ethernet connection. Of course this will not be needed once Ethernet OAM, E-LMI, etc, have become widely available, but for the time being I find the GRE keepalive has other good uses besides tunneling traffic.",

      "html": "We use standard NMS (HP Opeview, CA Spectrum, etc) to monitor customer devices. GRE Tunnel itself is just an other interface to these NMS systems, therefore if the tunnel went down the interface would become RED and an alarm will be triggered. Without this \"indicator\" tunnel interface we will have no way of knowing that the end-to-end path was actually down somewhere along the path. We have thought about using traps or monitoring routing neighbors logging, etc, but nothing beats the reliable tunnel interface Up/Down. This method has allowed us to open ticket proactively with the Metro Ethernet provider to resolve the issue. Keep in mind that the physical Ethernet interface itself could be UP/UP on the customer router, which isn't a reliable indicator.",

      "html": "Thanks, Ivan, for the good explanation. Using an inbound ACL on the tunnel interface can defeat the keepalive if the tunneled packet is GRE and you only allow IP. Also, troubleshooting is more difficult since the tunnel interface is up/up with the ACL.  For example ...  <br />  <br />Side A with keepalives and ACL    ... up/up.  <br />Side B with keepalives and no ACL ... up/down.  <br />  <br />Neither side can ping the remote end. Remove the keepalives and everything works.  <br />  <br />In response to William using GRE to monitor Metro Ethernet, you could use BFD which will take down the Ethernet interface if the end-to-end connectivity fails.  Thanks, Tom.",
