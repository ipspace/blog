  html: I happened to be messing with an OSPF lab today, so I decided to experiment
    per your post. However, I noticed that the router ID doesn't change even after
    'clear ip ospf [process_id] process'.<BR/><BR/>Neighbors still report the original
    ID, as does 'show ip ospf'.<BR/><BR/>This was observed on a 3725 running 12.2(15)T14
    and a 3560G running 12.2(25r)SE1, so the change may only apply in more recent
    code.

  html: I did test on 6500 with 12.2(18)SXF.<BR/>If router id is derived from interface
    IP address, than change of interface ip address or interface shutdown and clear
    ip ospf process command does not change router id. If router id is derived from
    router-id command, than change of router-id command and clear ip ospf process
    will change router-id. Thank for hint!
