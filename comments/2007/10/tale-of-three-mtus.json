So in this case the payload is an ethernet packet, and the &#39;outer&#39; ethernet frame has two MPLS labels. If my IP MTU is normally 1500, I would be encapsulating a 1514 byte frame in a 14+4+4 byte header, giving (I think) 1536 bytes on the wire. What are the correct MTU commands for this scenario?",

      "html": "A great post. I agree that the tcp mss adjust command is particularly useful at sorting out MTU issues. Having spent a few years running MPLS I&#39;d also recommend setting an interface to 802.1q on FE interfaces to squeeze and extra four bytes of overhead out of the ethernet frame. Most Cisco FE ports are fixed at 1500 bytes so it&#39;s a usual workaround if you want to run MPLS on an FE port. If in addition you want to run MPLS VPNs on top of this (again on an FE port) you will need an additional four bytes, so you&#39;ll need to set the MPLS MTU to 1504 (or above). The problem with this is your effective interface MTU now becomes 1496 - meaning you will need good old tcp mss adjust for general traffic. Less of a problem these days with GE ports and the ability to set interface MTU over 1500 bytes.",

      "html": "Hi. We&#39;ve been troubleshooting some file transfer performance issues in our network and have narrowed it down, using various testing, to what we believe is our MPLS L3 links between our data center Core and Distribution switches. Currently, the core has 2 10G links, each a /30 L3 link with MPLS on it and an MTU size of 1508. Looking at the stats, we see 100&#39;s of millions of giants on the switch interfaces, these are 6509&#39;s with SUP-720 3B&#39;s by the way. 8 port 10G blades. All 6509&#39;s, cards and IOS match between cores and dists. Application traffic is not affected, but any type of file transfer does appear to be. We are thinking that due to the 1508 MTU size for MPLS (no specific ip or MPLS MTU settiings, just HW), that it&#39;s creating performance issues for these transfers, for example, winscp (tcp 22), netapp, oracle, cifs, etc. Anyone run into this or have any recommendations?",
