      "html": "@Anonymous(1): You're right, the +++ was hidden somewhere deep in my subconsciousness. But at least that was a well known \"feature\" introduced because someone somewhere couldn't get his modem signal handling right (if you were using the DTR correctly, you could disconnect the call simply by dropping it, no need for an escape sequence). The synchronous modems were always believed to be better than that ;)<BR/><BR/>@Anonymous(2) (gee, it's hard to tell you guys apart, you all look the same :) The IGMP snooping is well-controlled activity. The switch knows what Ethernet frames are, knows which frames are IGMP frames and knows where to look and how to interpret the data ... whereas the stupid modem just latched onto whatever looked like the right bitstream having no clue about frames or anything above them.",
