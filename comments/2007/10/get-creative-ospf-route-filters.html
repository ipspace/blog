            <div class="comment-content">If you're deploying the same filter on every OSPF router in the domain, it's much easier (and more resource-effective) to filter the incoming prefixes in the redistribution points. Obviously I have to reiterate: the <B>distribute-list in</B> used in OSPF <I>does NOT</I> reduce the number of LSAs, memory consumption or CPU usage, just the prefixes that are transferred into the IP routing table.<BR/><BR/>Furthermore &hellip; I've been teaching, writing and saying this for 15 year, but obviously the myth persists: you should NOT (repeat NOT) redistribute BGP into IGP. You might have to in the CCIE scenarios to get points, but should never do it in real life. And the <B>distribute-list in</B> will not help you; the routers will still drown under the type-5 LSAs, the CPU utilization will still go through the roof, only you won't see the routes in the <B>show ip route</B> printout.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Whether your OSPF routers survive messed-up redistribution of BGP routes depends on a number of factors. The LSAs are still there (on all routers) and the partial SPF is still run, so the memory, bandwidth and CPU consumptions are high. <BR/><BR/>You do, however, reduce the IP routing table and CEF table sizes (assuming the OSPF routers are not running BGP as well), which might be enough to save you.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">You should clarify that you should never redistribute *Internet* BGP prefixes into an IGP.<BR/><BR/>If you are running enterprise MPLS VPNs with a service provider that requires BGP, BGP<->IGP redistribution is going to be the rule rather than the exception.<BR/><BR/>On the topic at hand, I would say that the maximum-prefix feature, along with careful use of TACACS authorization, are better ways to prevent redistribution mistakes than maintaining a lot of route filters.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">@js: You're absolutely right, it applies primarily to the Internet scenarios ... although even MPLS VPNs are simpler if you can use default route into VPN IGP ;)<BR/><BR/>I have to test the maximum-prefix feature to figure out what it drops and under what circumstances.</div>
