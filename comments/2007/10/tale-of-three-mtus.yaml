  html: I think one of the most tricky MTU issues are when you have GRE tunnel with
    or without IPSec. This document from Cisco documented the potential issues and
    how you can workaround them.<BR/><BR/>http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk827/tk369/technologies_white_paper09186a00800d6979.shtml<BR/><BR/>With
    businesses going global one can expect to see more IPSec+GRE tunnels to be deployed
    everywhere.

  html: I found that the tcp mss adjust is a must-use command to avoid fragmentation
    and reassembly by the routers if IPSec and/or GRE is involved. The only time where
    I must set the IP MTU to 1500 inside a GRE tunnel was that my customer was having
    a home-grown apps that needed to see the entire 1500-byte packet intact.

  html: There is some additional interesting information that I summarised to the
    cisco nsp list last year with regards to h/w mtu on cisco 7200 (with PA-FE DEC
    chipsets), mpls MTU and general MTU requirements for AToM circuits from point
    of view of CE->PE and PE->P links.<BR/><BR/>Archive here:<BR/><BR/>http://puck.nether.net/pipermail/cisco-nsp/2006-June/031765.html

  html: I have had a major issue when I tried to change the IP mtu size of a router
    running IPSec tunnels. The router (cisco 2851 with 12.4(15).T4 changed the interface
    MTU also to 1400 (with my IP MTU 1400 command). With a firewall in between blocking
    ICMP, PMTUD also broke. Is this is known "feature"? I know that changing the MTU
    interface value would automatically change the IP MTU but not the other way around.
    ???

  html: Hi,<br /><br />I&#39;m till confused about the types of MTUs<br /><br />Could
    someone please elaborate a bit more on this <br /><br />1- IP MTU is counted from
    where in the Packet ?<br />2- Does the interface MTU include the header of the
    layer 2 ?<br />if not is the IP MTU equal to the interface MTU ? If so why do
    we need the change any of those values ?<br />3- How do i set the MPLS MTU ? if
    possible , kindly provide an example<br /><br /><br />thx

  html: This was very helpful, but still not entirely sure what MTU I should be using
    in this situation.. I am configuring a pair of interfaces for EoMPLS. So in this
    case the payload is an ethernet packet, and the &#39;outer&#39; ethernet frame
    has two MPLS labels. If my IP MTU is normally 1500, I would be encapsulating a
    1514 byte frame in a 14+4+4 byte header, giving (I think) 1536 bytes on the wire.
    What are the correct MTU commands for this scenario?

  html: A great post. I agree that the tcp mss adjust command is particularly useful
    at sorting out MTU issues. Having spent a few years running MPLS I&#39;d also
    recommend setting an interface to 802.1q on FE interfaces to squeeze and extra
    four bytes of overhead out of the ethernet frame. Most Cisco FE ports are fixed
    at 1500 bytes so it&#39;s a usual workaround if you want to run MPLS on an FE
    port. If in addition you want to run MPLS VPNs on top of this (again on an FE
    port) you will need an additional four bytes, so you&#39;ll need to set the MPLS
    MTU to 1504 (or above). The problem with this is your effective interface MTU
    now becomes 1496 - meaning you will need good old tcp mss adjust for general traffic.
    Less of a problem these days with GE ports and the ability to set interface MTU
    over 1500 bytes.

  html: Hi. We&#39;ve been troubleshooting some file transfer performance issues in
    our network and have narrowed it down, using various testing, to what we believe
    is our MPLS L3 links between our data center Core and Distribution switches. Currently,
    the core has 2 10G links, each a /30 L3 link with MPLS on it and an MTU size of
    1508. Looking at the stats, we see 100&#39;s of millions of giants on the switch
    interfaces, these are 6509&#39;s with SUP-720 3B&#39;s by the way. 8 port 10G
    blades. All 6509&#39;s, cards and IOS match between cores and dists. Application
    traffic is not affected, but any type of file transfer does appear to be. We are
    thinking that due to the 1508 MTU size for MPLS (no specific ip or MPLS MTU settiings,
    just HW), that it&#39;s creating performance issues for these transfers, for example,
    winscp (tcp 22), netapp, oracle, cifs, etc. Anyone run into this or have any recommendations?

    html: It depends on the input buffer size (and hardware/software implementation
      details). If the packet fits into the buffer, I&#39;d expect the router to process
      it. <br /><br />If you get buffer overflow, then the packet is dropped at the
      hardware level before ever being looked at.
