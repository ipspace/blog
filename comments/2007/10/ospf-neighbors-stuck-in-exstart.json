      "html": "I have got an interesting one.<BR/><BR/>A few years ago I got called to troubleshoot an OSPF Exstart problem, Both routers were connected together over an international frame relay PVC. Both side had MTU 1500 bytes set on their interfaces initially but OSPF got stuck in Exstart. I knew about the OSPF MTU Mismatch issue back then but this one didn't seem to be it because the MTU size match on both ends. However, I was told it was an international Frame Relay PVC so I asked how the PVC was built. It actually went through three providers, and the provider in the middle had the PVC mtu set at 1100 bytes for some reasons and that was the culprit. The fix, as it turned out, was to lower the interface IP MTU on the customer routers (IP MTU = 1024)because the ospf mtu-ignore bit didn't solve it (this was because the middle Frame Relay provider dropped the over-sized frames at layer 2). It was a very unique problem so I would like to pass along. Nowadays frame relay is going away so we may never encounter a problem like this one.",

However, intermittently we are still getting some strange adjacency losses. <br />This started with an existing network that I am trying to fix. Originally no priorities were set anywhere and all Area 0 routers were set to priority 1 (default). I fixed that and the problem became MORE common - it had been happening once or twice every 3 months. <br /> I discovered then that the NTP server config on all the network equipment was inconsistent. So I fixed that, pointed all devices to the appropriate NTP servers (One of which was the loopback on our core router which had and IP that already existed on the BDR as the router ID). Finally yesterday for the first time in 10 days there were no OSPF messages of adj change in the logs. <br />All devices have identical MTU,Hello, Dead, and Carrier delay timers. <br /><br /> My questions are:<br />What affect did NTP have on OSPF? Could all the issues have been resolved by finding that duplicate IP in Area 0? Has anyone else seen issues with this type of mixed environment (HP, Cisco, H3C)? ",
