  html: Deployed in every OSPF router in the domain, would prevent insertion of extraneous
    routing table entries into the FIB.<BR/><BR/>Imagine someone running OSPF and
    BGP, and a network engineer doing a "redistribute bgp" into OSPF - and image how
    those poor OSPF speakers would feel :)<BR/><BR/>Add a distribute-list in only
    allowing networks you know to be in your domain - filter everything else.

  html: 'If you''re deploying the same filter on every OSPF router in the domain,
    it''s much easier (and more resource-effective) to filter the incoming prefixes
    in the redistribution points. Obviously I have to reiterate: the <B>distribute-list
    in</B> used in OSPF <I>does NOT</I> reduce the number of LSAs, memory consumption
    or CPU usage, just the prefixes that are transferred into the IP routing table.<BR/><BR/>Furthermore
    &hellip; I''ve been teaching, writing and saying this for 15 year, but obviously
    the myth persists: you should NOT (repeat NOT) redistribute BGP into IGP. You
    might have to in the CCIE scenarios to get points, but should never do it in real
    life. And the <B>distribute-list in</B> will not help you; the routers will still
    drown under the type-5 LSAs, the CPU utilization will still go through the roof,
    only you won''t see the routes in the <B>show ip route</B> printout.'

  html: I was trying to say "this would be a measure to prevent ERRORS"<BR/><BR/>Kind
    of "last time someone SNAFU'ed and did a redistribute of BGP into OSPF by mistake,
    we crashed 80% of the routers"<BR/><BR/>So, this is the cure :)

  html: Whether your OSPF routers survive messed-up redistribution of BGP routes depends
    on a number of factors. The LSAs are still there (on all routers) and the partial
    SPF is still run, so the memory, bandwidth and CPU consumptions are high. <BR/><BR/>You
    do, however, reduce the IP routing table and CEF table sizes (assuming the OSPF
    routers are not running BGP as well), which might be enough to save you.

  html: You should clarify that you should never redistribute *Internet* BGP prefixes
    into an IGP.<BR/><BR/>If you are running enterprise MPLS VPNs with a service provider
    that requires BGP, BGP<->IGP redistribution is going to be the rule rather than
    the exception.<BR/><BR/>On the topic at hand, I would say that the maximum-prefix
    feature, along with careful use of TACACS authorization, are better ways to prevent
    redistribution mistakes than maintaining a lot of route filters.

  html: '@js: You''re absolutely right, it applies primarily to the Internet scenarios
    ... although even MPLS VPNs are simpler if you can use default route into VPN
    IGP ;)<BR/><BR/>I have to test the maximum-prefix feature to figure out what it
    drops and under what circumstances.'

  html: I had to filter OSPF routes from a PIX that was sending host routes for all
    of it's NATed addresses out of two interfaces with the same cost.
