      "html": "Mmm, just did some little testing and found that it would be very nice to overrride OS MTU. My IBM X60 is preinstalled with Win XP pro and full set of IBM branded drivers and somehow it has MTU set to 1300 for all interfaces. So I cant really test MTU over hops without changing windows MTU with regedit.",

      "html": "Can't do. I have to send out packets with DF bit set, otherwise the path MTU discovery is not triggered at all. If the packet has the DF bit set and its size is greater than the outgoing interface MTU or the dynamic MTU discovered for the target host (more about that when I do some more tests and write the post about how the path MTU discovery really works), it's rejected by the IP stack internally (with the PACKET TOO BIG error).",
