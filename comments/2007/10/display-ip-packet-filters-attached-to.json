      "html": "Good - are you accepting \"enhancement requests\" ? :)<BR/><BR/>a) for the script to pause and print a \"more\" or similar when reaches line 24 - or whatever the term len is. Otherwise, with long access lists, the output just scrolls out :)<BR/><BR/>b) would be cool to actually READ the access-list from the running-config and print (if any) the REMarks associated with the lines - something sadly missing from the \"sh access-l X\" command :(<BR/><BR/>c) could the script tabulate and maybe sort by proto the matches? not necessarily in the order the ACL has been written. Example ACL:<BR/><BR/>deny tcp any any eq 80<BR/>deny udp any any eq 161<BR/>deny tcp any any eq 23<BR/><BR/>it would be nice to have something like:<BR/><BR/>ACTION | PROTO | SRC | DST | PORTS | HITS<BR/>deny   | tcp   | any | any | 23               | 200<BR/>deny   | tcp   | any | any | 80     | 120<BR/>deny   | udp   | any | any | 161    | 977<BR/><BR/>Just some ideas to make it more useful :)",

The \"show running\" command can take quite a long time.<BR/><BR/>#C: this is the one thing I would not even try to address (well, maybe in some distant future ;). I am positive each IOS user would like to see a different format. I might get back to this one when I'll start going deeper into writing web-based applications for IOS (it's been on my back-burner for quite some time).",
