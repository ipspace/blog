            <div class="comment-content">I have got an interesting one.<BR/><BR/>A few years ago I got called to troubleshoot an OSPF Exstart problem, Both routers were connected together over an international frame relay PVC. Both side had MTU 1500 bytes set on their interfaces initially but OSPF got stuck in Exstart. I knew about the OSPF MTU Mismatch issue back then but this one didn't seem to be it because the MTU size match on both ends. However, I was told it was an international Frame Relay PVC so I asked how the PVC was built. It actually went through three providers, and the provider in the middle had the PVC mtu set at 1100 bytes for some reasons and that was the culprit. The fix, as it turned out, was to lower the interface IP MTU on the customer routers (IP MTU = 1024)because the ospf mtu-ignore bit didn't solve it (this was because the middle Frame Relay provider dropped the over-sized frames at layer 2). It was a very unique problem so I would like to pass along. Nowadays frame relay is going away so we may never encounter a problem like this one.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">You should set the system MTU to 1500, not 1514 (unless I'm gravely mistaken, the MTU specifies the payload size, not the layer-2 frame size).<BR/><BR/>There SHOULD be no negative impact, unless the workstations in your LAN use jumbo frames (and let's assume that the switches are not MPLS PE routers :).<BR/><BR/>As for the BVI interface; I can set the MTU and IP MTU on a BVI interface on a router (using 12.4(15)T1), but as I said in a previous comment, you cannot set per-interface MTU on a Cat3550 at all.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Google got me here with the magic words mtu + ospf while looking for some info regarding this topic for a post in my new blog. I basically wrote the same (in spanish), but added something that I found pretty interesting; lowering back the mtu or removing the ip ospf mtu-ignore and see what would happen. Just the latter would bring us back to the issue. MTU would just be an issue again whenever the adjacency is rebuilt...just my two cents.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I am having an issue with OSPF, we have HP, Cisco, and H3C in our Area 0. Router priorities are set, remote sites are priority 0 and the main sites are 250 and lower (to specify DR). However, intermittently we are still getting some strange adjacency losses. <br />This started with an existing network that I am trying to fix. Originally no priorities were set anywhere and all Area 0 routers were set to priority 1 (default). I fixed that and the problem became MORE common - it had been happening once or twice every 3 months. <br /> I discovered then that the NTP server config on all the network equipment was inconsistent. So I fixed that, pointed all devices to the appropriate NTP servers (One of which was the loopback on our core router which had and IP that already existed on the BDR as the router ID). Finally yesterday for the first time in 10 days there were no OSPF messages of adj change in the logs. <br />All devices have identical MTU,Hello, Dead, and Carrier delay timers. <br /><br /> My questions are:<br />What affect did NTP have on OSPF? Could all the issues have been resolved by finding that duplicate IP in Area 0? Has anyone else seen issues with this type of mixed environment (HP, Cisco, H3C)? </div>
