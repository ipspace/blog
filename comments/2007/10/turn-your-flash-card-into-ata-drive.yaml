  html: Just an FYI, I tried once to use a CF card-to-PCMCIA adapter on a 1602 router
    to see if the router would see it.  The router kicked out an error indicating
    there was something missing (I assume there is a special IC in the Cisco-approved
    PCMCIA flash cards) and kicked out an error and froze - no boot, nothing.  It
    isn't entirely related to the post but should show the older Cisco gear appears
    to have some specific requirements for flash used on the devices that newer gear
    (x800s, etc) doesn't.
