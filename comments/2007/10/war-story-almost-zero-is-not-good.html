            <div class="comment-content">But it has *always* been that way, Ivan - since waaaay back to modems and the "+++" escape sequence<BR/><BR/>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<BR/>Command_and_Data_modes_%28modem%29<BR/><BR/>And actually, the moral of the story is: please, no CONTROL over the DATA channel :)<BR/><BR/>We could argue that modern devices run control and data over the same media (haven't yet seen a router with ethernet interfaces for forwarding packets, and ethernet interfaces for routing protocol ;)), but those are different protocols sharing the same media - routers don't try to find LSA updates in the middle of the DATA stream for an FTP transfer (or not that I know ;))</div>

            <div class="comment-content">@Anonymous(1): You're right, the +++ was hidden somewhere deep in my subconsciousness. But at least that was a well known "feature" introduced because someone somewhere couldn't get his modem signal handling right (if you were using the DTR correctly, you could disconnect the call simply by dropping it, no need for an escape sequence). The synchronous modems were always believed to be better than that ;)<BR/><BR/>@Anonymous(2) (gee, it's hard to tell you guys apart, you all look the same :) The IGMP snooping is well-controlled activity. The switch knows what Ethernet frames are, knows which frames are IGMP frames and knows where to look and how to interpret the data ... whereas the stupid modem just latched onto whatever looked like the right bitstream having no clue about frames or anything above them.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan, anything to make you happy - now you will know "Anonymous 1", aka the "+++" guy as "BlueDemon" - not because I'm blue or a Demon, but just because I happen to be drinking a can of Full Throttle Blue Demon - drink that I highly recommend - as it contains caffeine, niacin, vitamins B6 and B12 and tastes way better than Red Bull ;)</div>
