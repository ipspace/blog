  html: I did another thing. I modified your ipInterfaces.tcl-script to also include
    ACL-in and ACL-out columns.<BR/><BR/>It gives me a nice tabular view of which
    interfaces have which access-lists.

  html: Good - are you accepting "enhancement requests" ? :)<BR/><BR/>a) for the script
    to pause and print a "more" or similar when reaches line 24 - or whatever the
    term len is. Otherwise, with long access lists, the output just scrolls out :)<BR/><BR/>b)
    would be cool to actually READ the access-list from the running-config and print
    (if any) the REMarks associated with the lines - something sadly missing from
    the "sh access-l X" command :(<BR/><BR/>c) could the script tabulate and maybe
    sort by proto the matches? not necessarily in the order the ACL has been written.
    Example ACL:<BR/><BR/>deny tcp any any eq 80<BR/>deny udp any any eq 161<BR/>deny
    tcp any any eq 23<BR/><BR/>it would be nice to have something like:<BR/><BR/>ACTION
    | PROTO | SRC | DST | PORTS | HITS<BR/>deny   | tcp   | any | any | 23               |
    200<BR/>deny   | tcp   | any | any | 80     | 120<BR/>deny   | udp   | any | any
    | 161    | 977<BR/><BR/>Just some ideas to make it more useful :)

  html: '@Anonymous: of course I''m accepting enhancement requests :)<BR/><BR/>#A:
    doable, will write a post when finished.<BR/><BR/>#B: doable, but I am not sure
    whether the "general public" would find it usable. The "show running" command
    can take quite a long time.<BR/><BR/>#C: this is the one thing I would not even
    try to address (well, maybe in some distant future ;). I am positive each IOS
    user would like to see a different format. I might get back to this one when I''ll
    start going deeper into writing web-based applications for IOS (it''s been on
    my back-burner for quite some time).'

  html: 'Well - guess I can always learn TCL and do (C) - and contribute back. Not
    likely, though ;)<BR/><BR/>BTW: CSCse26966 - show access-list should provide an
    option to print configured remarks'
