  html: Workaround found after reading the "Executing IOS commands from Tcl shell"
    from the "Tclsh on Cisco IOS tutorial".<BR/><BR/>On the above article it is mentionned
    that the ios_config command is executed inside the context of another VTY line
    (also found with the AAA debug). The workaround is to define the FIRST VTY line
    with "transport input none" to prevent ssh or telnet to grab it and to configure
    the aaa authorization without any command authorization for this line.<BR/><BR/>Kind
    regards<BR/>Christian Chautems

  html: Hi Christian!<BR/><BR/>Sorry for a late reply, I was on vacation. Your observation
    was successfully reproduced and is now the bug CSCsu65401. Thanks for the perfect
    workaround :)<BR/><BR/>Ivan

  html: No idea. If this impacts your production network, you should open a case with
    Cisco TAC.

  html: 'To &quot;invitado&quot;: <br /><br />inside EEM there is a generic queue
    to pass messages, with producers and consumers. Each entry has a specific type
    (trigger event, aaa event...), and there is a different consumer for each type.<br
    /><br />The message &quot;EM: No consumer registered for any event type&quot;
    appears when:<br /> <br /> 1) EEM debug is enabled, and<br /> 2) when there a
    message in the queue, but there&#39;s no consumer associated.<br /><br />This
    is not a bug nor a problem, but rather a notification to help IOS developers.'

    html: The results of an &quot;action cli command&quot; are stored in $_cli_result
      variable, not printed on the screen. Use &quot;action 2.2 puts $_cli_result&quot;
      to see them, see http://wiki.nil.com/Regular_expressions_in_Embedded_Event_Manager_applets
      for an example.
