  html: Hi  Ivan,<br /><br />It seems to me that you might have an error in the syntax
    of the redirect ftp portion of action 1.0 in this EEM script. As much as I remember
    it should be something like this instead:<br /><br />redirect ftp://username:password@host/path
    <br /><br />In any case, you&#39;ve a great and very useful blog. Keep going!<br
    /><br />Regards.<br /><br />AF.
