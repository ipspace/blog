  html: 'A request for the an article here, or the next edition of your book is how
    to configure PPTP through NAT for remote access to a LAN server.<BR/><BR/>It seems
    straightforward enough: enable PPTP and gre (via an access list ...) from out
    to in, but if you limit in to out traffic, you need to configure PPTP and gre
    in that direction too.<BR/><BR/>But here''s the kicker. I have a rule that denies
    in->out traffic that claims to be from my next hop out (as well certain broadcasts).
    This is what SDM deposits, just as it did for classic ACLs.  Unfortunately, when
    combined with NAT, the in-out gre tunnel appears to be coming from my WAN ip address
    (ie, self) and so gets dropped.  The solution seems to be to allow gre to precede
    the spoofing filter.'

  html: If somebody tries to activate NAT/PAT (just run "ip nat inside / outside commands,
    even <BR/><BR/>with an empty or dummy access-list so that NAT/PAT is really unused)
    with the zone-based <BR/><BR/>policy firewall (ZPF) feature a surprise will happen
    when the router/firewall starts <BR/><BR/>receiving GRE packets from both sides
    (triggered by an on-going PPTP session to an inside <BR/><BR/>VPN server). In
    my scenario the class map access lists I'm using show "apparently" strange <BR/><BR/>results.
    If somebody want I can share detailed configuration/information and an <BR/><BR/>"unfriendly"
    but functional workaround. I'm running IOS Version 12.3(11r)T2, RELEASE SOFTWARE
    (fc1).<BR/>I suppose this is an IOS bug. I suggest that Cisco starts supporting
    automatically GRE <BR/><BR/>tunnels created by PPTP sessions like PIX products
    already supports. Suggested workarounds make the configuration complex and error
    prone. I appreciate more comments on this subject.<BR/>By the way ... I find out
    that the ESMTP L7 DPI inspection is also very restrictive/poor. For instance,
    it is not possible to use it with Microsoft Echange servers since this server
    uses several unsupported service extensions.

  html: 'I too have fallen foul of this PPTP/GRE problem with zone-based firewall.<BR/><BR/>I
    am trying to connect to a Win VPN/RAS server out on the internet but am getting
    an XP client "Error 806: A connection between your computer and the VPN server
    has been established, but the VPN connection cannot be completed.... Verify that
    protocol 47 (GRE) is allowed..."<BR/><BR/>Unfortunately neither SDM not the CLI
    allows me to specify "gre" as a class-map match protocol.<BR/><BR/>I''ve even
    tried opening up everything to that destination but with no success:<BR/>class-map
    type inspect match-any ABC-VPN<BR/> match protocol tcp<BR/> match protocol udp<BR/>
    match protocol icmp<BR/><BR/>I''m not clear how I''d use an ACL at the same time
    to specify it.<BR/><BR/>I have a static NAT for the client (i.e. no pool/overloaded
    ports).<BR/><BR/>IOS: 12.4(11)T2 and now 12.4(15)T1 running on a C1841.<BR/><BR/>Any
    ideas or pointers?'

    html: That was a limitation in early ZBFW implementation. I think it should work
      now (I vaguely remember discussing this subject, but it was year or two ago).

  html: '&quot;To control traffic that the router can send into a zone use a zone-pair
    from self to another zone. Use inspect in the service-policy to allow the return
    traffic.&quot;<br /><br />I believe that traffic to/from self zone cannot be inspected,
    just passed, at least with ios 12.4(24)T.'

    html: If &quot;publish&quot; means in paper form, the answer is &quot;no&quot;,
      but you can buy it on Kindle or as PDF.<br /><br />The update decision is in
      hands of Cisco Press and I haven&#39;t heard from them in years. Also the sales
      are pretty low, so I don&#39;t expect them to approach me with an update idea
      any time soon.

  html: Hello Ivan,  I added your ZBFW shortcut to my Safari books online bookshelf
    because it is a good reference.   Were you planning to update it or publish it?
