  html: Still, a router's job is to route packets. It was not designed to be a dns
    server.

  html: Well, no-one can disagree with your comment. However, not all routers deployed
    today are highly utilized (for example, my 800-series router having only an ISDN
    uplink is bored most of the time), so it makes sense to reuse them to provide
    other services as well (assuming, of course, you take measures to protect them
    from being overloaded) ... or you might need a quick fix to a network problem
    and having a router that can provide extra services really helps if you know how
    to use them.<BR/><BR/>I've also seen people who use pretty powerful boxes (7200-series
    or 7300-series routers) to provide solely the BGP route reflection service, as
    well as ingenious networking engineers who deployed boxes phased out of production
    network to serve as various servers (for example, NTP server).

  html: Hi,<BR/><BR/>I have an IPSec VPN between 2 sites.<BR/>Do you have any idea
    whether it's possible to route email for 1 particular domain (@company.com) over
    the VPN?

  html: Of course it can be done. Most mail servers support static (mail) routing
    configuration for a domain. For example, the Exchange 2003 message routing configuration
    is <A HREF="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb123967.aspx" REL="nofollow">described
    here</A>.<BR/><BR/>If you configure the destination mail server for <I>company.com</I>
    to be an address reachable over the IPSec VPN (the mail server on the other site),
    the mail for that domain will be delivered over the VPN.

  html: When I enabled the DNS server on my router it had issues until I realized
    it was DNS proxying to it's self. Once I did a <BR/><BR/>no ip name-server 10.1.1.1<BR/><BR/>,
    where 10.1.1.1 is the routers own f0/0 interface, the issues went away.<BR/><BR/>I'm
    just learning so I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time.  I just try things
    and see what happens but I was wondering if this could be the cause of high utilization
    others are seeing.

  html: I haven't tried to recreate the scenario where a router would try to use itself
    as a DNS server. I tried to do something similar a while ago and failed miserably
    - it simply wouldn't work, so I doubt that you could generate a DNS loop resulting
    in high CPU utilization this way.
