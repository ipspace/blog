      "html": "A request for the an article here, or the next edition of your book is how to configure PPTP through NAT for remote access to a LAN server.<BR/><BR/>It seems straightforward enough: enable PPTP and gre (via an access list ...) from out to in, but if you limit in to out traffic, you need to configure PPTP and gre in that direction too.<BR/><BR/>But here's the kicker. I have a rule that denies in->out traffic that claims to be from my next hop out (as well certain broadcasts). This is what SDM deposits, just as it did for classic ACLs.  Unfortunately, when combined with NAT, the in-out gre tunnel appears to be coming from my WAN ip address (ie, self) and so gets dropped.  The solution seems to be to allow gre to precede the spoofing filter.",

      "html": "If somebody tries to activate NAT/PAT (just run \"ip nat inside / outside commands, even <BR/><BR/>with an empty or dummy access-list so that NAT/PAT is really unused) with the zone-based <BR/><BR/>policy firewall (ZPF) feature a surprise will happen when the router/firewall starts <BR/><BR/>receiving GRE packets from both sides (triggered by an on-going PPTP session to an inside <BR/><BR/>VPN server). In my scenario the class map access lists I'm using show \"apparently\" strange <BR/><BR/>results. If somebody want I can share detailed configuration/information and an <BR/><BR/>\"unfriendly\" but functional workaround. I'm running IOS Version 12.3(11r)T2, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1).<BR/>I suppose this is an IOS bug. I suggest that Cisco starts supporting automatically GRE <BR/><BR/>tunnels created by PPTP sessions like PIX products already supports. Suggested workarounds make the configuration complex and error prone. I appreciate more comments on this subject.<BR/>By the way ... I find out that the ESMTP L7 DPI inspection is also very restrictive/poor. For instance, it is not possible to use it with Microsoft Echange servers since this server uses several unsupported service extensions.",
