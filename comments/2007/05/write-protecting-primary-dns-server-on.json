      "html": "Well, no-one can disagree with your comment. However, not all routers deployed today are highly utilized (for example, my 800-series router having only an ISDN uplink is bored most of the time), so it makes sense to reuse them to provide other services as well (assuming, of course, you take measures to protect them from being overloaded) ... or you might need a quick fix to a network problem and having a router that can provide extra services really helps if you know how to use them.<BR/><BR/>I've also seen people who use pretty powerful boxes (7200-series or 7300-series routers) to provide solely the BGP route reflection service, as well as ingenious networking engineers who deployed boxes phased out of production network to serve as various servers (for example, NTP server).",
