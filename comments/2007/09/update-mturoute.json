      "html": "Couple comments:<BR/><BR/># Whenever the Windows TCP stack receives an ICMP specifying the maximum MTU, it caches the reported MTU size (makes sense).<BR/><BR/>I assume it caches the *minimum* MTU from A to B - not the first one it comes along. Otherwise, why do Path MTU ? :)<BR/><BR/># The cached MTU sizes eventually expire (but I was not able to find any documentation on the expiration time).<BR/><BR/>That's brain-dead. It probably did make sense back in the '80s or so, when for going A to B there was one and only one path. Now that you can have multiple paths - either being used concurrently or in case of failure - caching the MTU for ONE given instance of ONE path from A to B makes little sense.<BR/><BR/>But I guess that's why (I assume) every given X interval they redo the PathMTU - in case tha path changed.<BR/><BR/>Obviously, it means that you have a time T0 when the PathMTU is right (and said time might be very low) and a time T1 when you're sending a bunch of datagrams with the incorrect size - which are to be fragmented - until Windows reruns the PathMTU algorithm.<BR/><BR/>I haven't sniffed, but I'm pretty sure that, to prevent dropping packets, they probably send the packets (even after PathMU) with DF cleared. <BR/><BR/>Or they send them with DF set, and the 1st time they get a \"frag needed, but DF set\" they rerun the PathMTU algorithm . . . <BR/><BR/>RFC-4821 provides for some interesting reading on this whole issue of PMTU (old way) and the \"new and improved\" suggested method ;)",
