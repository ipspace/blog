  html: Couple comments:<BR/><BR/># Whenever the Windows TCP stack receives an ICMP
    specifying the maximum MTU, it caches the reported MTU size (makes sense).<BR/><BR/>I
    assume it caches the *minimum* MTU from A to B - not the first one it comes along.
    Otherwise, why do Path MTU ? :)<BR/><BR/># The cached MTU sizes eventually expire
    (but I was not able to find any documentation on the expiration time).<BR/><BR/>That's
    brain-dead. It probably did make sense back in the '80s or so, when for going
    A to B there was one and only one path. Now that you can have multiple paths -
    either being used concurrently or in case of failure - caching the MTU for ONE
    given instance of ONE path from A to B makes little sense.<BR/><BR/>But I guess
    that's why (I assume) every given X interval they redo the PathMTU - in case tha
    path changed.<BR/><BR/>Obviously, it means that you have a time T0 when the PathMTU
    is right (and said time might be very low) and a time T1 when you're sending a
    bunch of datagrams with the incorrect size - which are to be fragmented - until
    Windows reruns the PathMTU algorithm.<BR/><BR/>I haven't sniffed, but I'm pretty
    sure that, to prevent dropping packets, they probably send the packets (even after
    PathMU) with DF cleared. <BR/><BR/>Or they send them with DF set, and the 1st
    time they get a "frag needed, but DF set" they rerun the PathMTU algorithm . .
    . <BR/><BR/>RFC-4821 provides for some interesting reading on this whole issue
    of PMTU (old way) and the "new and improved" suggested method ;)
