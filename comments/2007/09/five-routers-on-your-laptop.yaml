  html: Never tried it. A single router running OSPF and BGP (plus a zillion other
    processes IOS starts by default) consumes around 20% of CPU (40% of one core),
    so my eight routers consume 100% of both cores. That's not a real problem, as
    long as the routers can respond to routing protocol packets (and they are still
    OK in my scenario, no dropped adjacencies).<BR/><BR/>I have no idea what they
    want you to start in the 13-router lab, but if there are many concurrent features
    being configured, you might get over the edge.

  html: Hi Ivan, <BR/>I have been using it since its early developments! Now, i can
    load the full IEWBv4 topologies (6 7200s, 4 3640s-NM-16ESW, and 3 7200s as Backbones)
    with my CPU goes no more than 50% :) My Dell laptop is powerful enough and i bought
    it for this purpose! It is Intel Core Duo 2.2 with 4 GiG of RAM, yeeeha! and yes,
    it has a HDD with 7200RPM, too bad no SCSI yet! ;-)<BR/><BR/>It works great! Dynamips
    is a wonderful wonder!

  html: Hi intikhab,<BR/><BR/>My laptop is Dell Vostro 1500 with full options that
    are found on dell website. Quite expensive though! BTW, i ordered Vista ultimate
    but i ended up removing it because it...ah... it sucks!! :) i could not stand
    it and put windows XP instead to save my CPU and RAMs! Oh beside the irritation
    of the security messages that pops up every now and then...that made it REALLY
    sucks!!! ;-)<BR/><BR/>HTH

  html: '"What are the ethics of using the IOS images with Dynamips?"  <BR/><BR/>Good
    question, and I''ll answer with another, what are your ethics for using any software
    in a non-production environment explicitly for testing purposes?'

  html: '"what are your ethics for using any software in a non-production environment
    explicitly for testing purposes?" - excellent and well thought reply. <BR/><BR/>Although
    interestingly, it actually is in a kind of a production environment.. virtual
    servers can be added, multiple external interfaces can be added, acl''s applied
    and OSPF is still producing its coded production purpose and ultimately even,
    it''s not long before home systems will also be able to produce enough power to
    enable realtime clocking and functionality... (okay ASICs, TCAMs, Int Buffs and
    much more to consider for a full functionality).<BR/><BR/>I am surprised Cisco
    hasn''t tried to buy this out yet..  one can only presume they decided it''s easier
    to copy.'

  html: What's the ethics of being a company that makes a shitload of money by selling
    overpriced hardware, and proprietary software?<BR/><BR/>What's the ethics of gaining
    market control, using outdated shitty hardware and software?<BR/><BR/>It's OK
    to take proprietary software, you are not stealing, you are freeing something
    that was first stolen from the community. <BR/><BR/>But Better than that is trying
    to use Free Software as much as possible.

  html: Mohammed,<BR/><BR/>while we might discuss whether it's OK to use the IOS image
    you're entitled to on non-Cisco hardware, supplying IOS images to third parties
    comes (in my understanding) close to software piracy. I really cannot help you.
