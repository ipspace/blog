Perhaps the answer is to attach it to the Vlan interface?<BR/><BR/>What I find perplexing is that the DHCP seems ropey both on the Wireless interfaces (although that could be to do with security settings, etc, I suppose) and the LAN interface with a Mac OS X Tiger.  Wired Windows machines seem less prone to DHCP failures.<BR/><BR/>A more complete listing of my setup, before I had added the bpduguard command, is at http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,18550344<BR/><BR/>Suggestions for a debugging strategy would be most welcome.<BR/><BR/>PS: DHCP is provided not by the router, but by a server attached to fa1.",
