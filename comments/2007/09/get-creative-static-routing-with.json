I have come across many of the same solutions that others have presented here only to discard them as: <br /><br /> STP doesn&#39;t work since the IPS device discards BPDU&#39;s. <br /> LACP is not supported on the 7206vxr (even though lacp is listed as a supported feature on 12.4(24)T2).  Etherchannel works fine but if only one link fails  <br /> UDLD aggressive doesn&#39;t register the link loss<br /><br />The IPS devices have multiple in/out interfaces so I had created cross-stack etherchannels between the 3750 switch stack and each 7206vxr, attempting for greater redundancy - it seems that single links to the 7206 routers would make fault detection much simpler.  I would prefer not to run a dynamic routing protocol in this area of the network, but I will if it is the &quot;best&quot; solution.<br /><br />Eagerly looking for the other &#39;in the meantime&#39; solutions...",
