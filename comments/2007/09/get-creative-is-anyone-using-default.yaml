  html: 'That''s cool - but it doesn''t work very well if you have *multiple* default
    routes in the CEF table:<BR/><BR/>router#sh ip cef 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 detail<BR/>0.0.0.0/0,
    version 232, epoch 0, per-destination sharing<BR/>366708 packets, 46049248 bytes<BR/>  via
    192.168.2.4, Ethernet0, 0 dependencies<BR/>    traffic share 1<BR/>    next hop
    192.168.2.4, Ethernet0<BR/>    valid adjacency<BR/>  via 192.168.2.5, Ethernet0,
    0 dependencies<BR/>    traffic share 1<BR/>    next hop 192.168.2.5, Ethernet0<BR/>    valid
    adjacency<BR/>  via 192.168.2.1, Ethernet0, 0 dependencies<BR/>    traffic share
    1<BR/>    next hop 192.168.2.1, Ethernet0<BR/>    valid adjacency<BR/>  217765

    second output rate 0 Kbits/sec<BR/>router#<BR/><BR/>so, all three are installed
    on the CEF table, and a sh ip route:<BR/><BR/>O*E2 0.0.0.0/0 [110/1] via 192.168.2.4,
    00:00:09, Ethernet0<BR/>               [110/1] via 192.168.2.5, 00:00:09, Ethernet0<BR/>               [110/1]
    via 192.168.2.1, 00:00:09, Ethernet0<BR/><BR/>so, how many packets are going thru
    each one? Anybody''s guess . . . .'

  html: Its a bit of a kludge, but if your route table isn't very big or dynamic you
    could create an access-list with permit statements matching your route table and
    a permit ip any any at the end, and check the numbers of matches. It would also
    allow you to log those packets to know where they're coming from or going.

  html: I realize I'm late to the game here being that it's almost November.  And
    this is certainly not the quickest/easiest, but it may be the dirtiest with the
    most overkill with potential to offer a lot more insight into the network.<BR/><BR/>How
    about slapping ntop on a linux box and enabling netflow on the interface?  A quick
    glance at the source/destination pairs would show you if it's going to one of
    the DR subnets or elsewhere (assuming you don't have more than a dozen or so DR
    subnets).  And once you've answered that question, enable netflow around the rest
    of the network and you've got yourself quite a resource for troubleshooting/forensics/etc.<BR/><BR/>Of
    course if you don't have a spare linux box and/or aren't familiar with ntop, well,
    cef or the access-list thing sound good too.
