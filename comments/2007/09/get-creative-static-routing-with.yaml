  html: Gre tunneling + floating routes (if the 3750 supports it). When the Gre tunnel
    goes down, first route gets removed from routing table. (Ugly)<BR/><BR/>or<BR/><BR/>SPT
    + Inter VLAN Switching(not sure). <BR/>Every ethernet interface goes into this
    vlan, and routes points to the next hop(not interface). SPT should handle L2 connectivity
    issues.<BR/><BR/>Are the same than yours?

  html: 1. Object tracking using IP SLA, pinging the remote end of the fibre link
    and removing the static route if this link goes down.  (...but would it cope with
    the interface being 'up' again after failure and routing over to the radio?)<BR/><BR/>2.
    Spanning Tree, blocking the radio interface.<BR/><BR/>3. LACP, bundle both and
    use all the bandwidth.

  html: Yeah. The best way is to have etherchannel between them. In case of failure
    port will get down, and then less preferable route over wireless will do the trick.

  html: Mikhail an anon, AFAIK, there is no support for bfd on 3750, and it's definitly
    that bfd will not be supported for static routes on 3750 (6500 sxf still don't
    have it).<BR/>so etherchannel, or udld. but udld needs additional configuration
    with errdisable stuff, that's why, imho, etherchannel is better :)<BR/>and yes,
    it's a very common case :)

  html: Actually, LACP over unequal bandwidth paths (not interfaces) may cause out-of-sequence
    frames, not packets, which will probably have a rather bad effect on throughput.

    converter is set up?  Many media converters have a test mode where a down link
    status is not passed from one side to another.  Once you take it out of test mode,
    it will pass status. Usually it's a small push button, or a switch. <BR/><BR/>Sean

  html: This is a common issue when using media converters. Problem is that line protocol
    is not being passed from the fibre to the switch. Even if the fibre drops, the
    switch still (rightly) sees line-protocol UP between itself and the media converter.
    <BR/><BR/>Usually there are some dip switches you can flip that will allow the
    unit to pass line-protocol. Check the documentation or manufacturers FAQ section.<BR/><BR/>With
    the line-protocol issue fixed you just need to use static routes which include
    the interface syntax.  Give the radio link a higher metric. Ethernet link drops,
    route gets removed and other link is used

    from the fiber side of the converter to the TP side of it. If you get that fixed,
    the rest is easy (static/floating static routes).

  html: 'I came across this post while searching for a similar problem of my own:<br
    /><br />Please consider the following:<br /><br /><br />FWSM-6509 (Act) -&gt;
    3750E -&gt; managed IPS -&gt; 7206vxr-&gt; ISP A<br />     |                                |                                          |<br
    />FWSM-6509 (Sty) -&gt; 3750E -&gt; managed IPS -&gt; 7206vxr-&gt; ISP B<br /><br
    /><br />With the externally managed IPS devices (bridged interfaces that don&#39;t
    forward BPDU&#39;s) between the border router and the perimeter switch-stack,
    links on the 3750E&#39;s stay up even if a border router fails / reloads for maintenance,
    etc (mush like the media converters in the original problem).  I have come across
    many of the same solutions that others have presented here only to discard them
    as: <br /><br /> STP doesn&#39;t work since the IPS device discards BPDU&#39;s.
    <br /> LACP is not supported on the 7206vxr (even though lacp is listed as a supported
    feature on 12.4(24)T2).  Etherchannel works fine but if only one link fails  <br
    /> UDLD aggressive doesn&#39;t register the link loss<br /><br />The IPS devices
    have multiple in/out interfaces so I had created cross-stack etherchannels between
    the 3750 switch stack and each 7206vxr, attempting for greater redundancy - it
    seems that single links to the 7206 routers would make fault detection much simpler.  I
    would prefer not to run a dynamic routing protocol in this area of the network,
    but I will if it is the &quot;best&quot; solution.<br /><br />Eagerly looking
    for the other &#39;in the meantime&#39; solutions...'
