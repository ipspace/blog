And this is certainly not the quickest/easiest, but it may be the dirtiest with the most overkill with potential to offer a lot more insight into the network.<BR/><BR/>How about slapping ntop on a linux box and enabling netflow on the interface?  A quick glance at the source/destination pairs would show you if it's going to one of the DR subnets or elsewhere (assuming you don't have more than a dozen or so DR subnets).  And once you've answered that question, enable netflow around the rest of the network and you've got yourself quite a resource for troubleshooting/forensics/etc.<BR/><BR/>Of course if you don't have a spare linux box and/or aren't familiar with ntop, well, cef or the access-list thing sound good too.",
