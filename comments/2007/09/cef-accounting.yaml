  html: I tried to turn on the IP CEF Accounting on Cisco 3550 which is used as a
    router for a network with about 50 computers. Unfortunately enabling the cef accounting
    led to high utilization of 3550, the  IP Input process usually used about 33%
    of CPU and what was even worst, was that some packets were duplicated on the 3550
    while forwarded :-/<BR/>At the end, I just turned it off.<BR/>The CEF Accounting
    can be very useful in some situations, but I definitely not recommend to enable
    it by default - at least if you really not going to use that statistics at all.<BR/><BR/>swr#sh

  html: Based on the symptoms you're describing, the moment you enable CEF accounting
    on a Cat3550, it stops ASIC-based L3 forwarding and falls back to process switching
    (high CPU load in IP input process).
