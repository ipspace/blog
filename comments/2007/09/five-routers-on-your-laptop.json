      "html": "Never tried it. A single router running OSPF and BGP (plus a zillion other processes IOS starts by default) consumes around 20% of CPU (40% of one core), so my eight routers consume 100% of both cores. That's not a real problem, as long as the routers can respond to routing protocol packets (and they are still OK in my scenario, no dropped adjacencies).<BR/><BR/>I have no idea what they want you to start in the 13-router lab, but if there are many concurrent features being configured, you might get over the edge.",

Now, i can load the full IEWBv4 topologies (6 7200s, 4 3640s-NM-16ESW, and 3 7200s as Backbones) with my CPU goes no more than 50% :) My Dell laptop is powerful enough and i bought it for this purpose! It is Intel Core Duo 2.2 with 4 GiG of RAM, yeeeha! and yes, it has a HDD with 7200RPM, too bad no SCSI yet! ;-)<BR/><BR/>It works great! Dynamips is a wonderful wonder!",

      "html": "\"what are your ethics for using any software in a non-production environment explicitly for testing purposes?\" - excellent and well thought reply. <BR/><BR/>Although interestingly, it actually is in a kind of a production environment.. virtual servers can be added, multiple external interfaces can be added, acl's applied and OSPF is still producing its coded production purpose and ultimately even, it's not long before home systems will also be able to produce enough power to enable realtime clocking and functionality... (okay ASICs, TCAMs, Int Buffs and much more to consider for a full functionality).<BR/><BR/>I am surprised Cisco hasn't tried to buy this out yet..  one can only presume they decided it's easier to copy.",
