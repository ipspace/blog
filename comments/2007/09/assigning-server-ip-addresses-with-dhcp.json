One of the limitations/issues I've run with the IOS DHCP server and setting up a reservation is that it only accepts on \"client-identifier\" per pool.<BR/><BR/>Picture this: AP to switch. router on same VLAN. Notebook with wireless and wired cards. You want for the notebook to get the same IP address no matter if the connection is wired or wireless. Tough luck - just one \"client-identifier\" per pool.<BR/><BR/>The use of a locally administered MAC address could solve my problem - if I used the same MAC for both the wired _and_ the wireless interface. Have to try and see what Vista thinks of it ;)",
