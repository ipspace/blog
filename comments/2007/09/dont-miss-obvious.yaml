  html: Always a good idea to start troubleshooting from the lowest layer. Check spanning
    tree, duplex, speed, interface counters, run TDR before moving onto a higher layer.

  html: Better yet would be the global config command "spanning-tree portfast default",
    which will turn on portfast on all switched ports and keep the interface configurations
    a little bit cleaner.  You can verify portfast default command is in there by
    using the "show spanning-tree summary" command.<BR/><BR/>- Bill

  html: The <B>spanning-tree portfast default</B> command is unfortunately not available
    on all platforms (my 1812 router with 12.4(15)T doesn't have it).

  html: I don't know what IOS versions use it, but the "switchport host" command has
    saved me us a lot of negotiation time.  Any port that's not a trunk gets this
    command, which actually sets the "spanning-tree portfast" command, turns off etherchanneling,
    and sets the mode to "access".

  html: The <B>bridge-group spanning-disabled</B> disables spanning tree only on the
    WLAN. The <B>spanning-tree portfast bpduguard</B> disables a port if someone is
    sending BPDUs on that port, but there's nothing in your config (as far as you've
    included it) that would disable spanning tree (and associated startup delay) on
    FastEthernet ports. You need <B>spanning-tree portfast</B> on each FastEthernet
    interface.

  html: 'Thanks.  The <B>spanning tree</B> command is not available on the fa1+ ports
    of this 1801w.  Perhaps the answer is to attach it to the Vlan interface?<BR/><BR/>What
    I find perplexing is that the DHCP seems ropey both on the Wireless interfaces
    (although that could be to do with security settings, etc, I suppose) and the
    LAN interface with a Mac OS X Tiger.  Wired Windows machines seem less prone to
    DHCP failures.<BR/><BR/>A more complete listing of my setup, before I had added
    the bpduguard command, is at http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,18550344<BR/><BR/>Suggestions
    for a debugging strategy would be most welcome.<BR/><BR/>PS: DHCP is provided
    not by the router, but by a server attached to fa1.'

  html: Sorry. My bad.  The spannig-tree portfast is indeed available.<BR/><BR/>I'll
    see what difference it makes; I occasionally forget to switch off the wireless
    on a pc when I plug it into the net.

  html: <I>Do I also need to do a <B>switchport mode access</B> to get portfast to
    take?</I><BR/><BR/>That helps :) And since you won't use trunking on any of those
    ports, it also prevents configuration errors.

  html: All this may be a good subject for a further article.<BR/><BR/>I note that
    <B>switchport mode access</B> does not show up in the config, which presumably
    means that it is the default.<BR/><BR/>There are, however, potential elephant
    traps, especially for someone like me who is hazy on this stuff.  For example:<BR/><BR/>i)
    if I access my router via both ethernet and wireless, what should happen if I
    use only access mode?<BR/><BR/>ii) if I use different VLANs to distingish different
    SSIDs / classes of user, do i need to use trunking, or not?
