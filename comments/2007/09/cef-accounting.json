Unfortunately enabling the cef accounting led to high utilization of 3550, the  IP Input process usually used about 33% of CPU and what was even worst, was that some packets were duplicated on the 3550 while forwarded :-/<BR/>At the end, I just turned it off.<BR/>The CEF Accounting can be very useful in some situations, but I definitely not recommend to enable it by default - at least if you really not going to use that statistics at all.<BR/><BR/>swr#sh ver | i Version<BR/>Cisco IOS Software, C3550 Software (C3550-IPSERVICESK9-M), Version 12.2(35)SE, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)",
