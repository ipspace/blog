  html: 'You might have a problem with flash file if you don''t have disk-like flash
    memory (the <B>show file systems</B> should display your flash: as a <I>disk</I>
    filesystem).'

  html: If you have a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; flash file system, the files never
    disappear, they are just marked as deleted (and you have to squeeze it manually).
    As you have to store the DHCP bindings in a file whenever something changes (after
    a short delay, of course), you could have a lot of old versions left in the flash
    after a while &hellip; not something I would want to have in a production network.

  html: Makes sense.  On that note if you're running DHCP on an ISR you shouldn't
    have that issue since the flash is formatted Class C, correct?

  html: Well, new ISR routers come with class-C formatted flash, older ones are still
    formatted as class-B (but can be reformatted into class-C).

  html: It's <A HREF="http://ioshints.blogspot.com/2007/10/turn-your-flash-card-into-ata-drive.html"
    REL="nofollow">described here</A>. I knew I've been writing about it already,
    so I've entered "format flash" into the "Search blog" input field (top left) :))

  html: 'I noticed today that writing the DHCP binding to nvram has one drawback (at
    least on the 2801): writing to NVRAM seems to be a very CPU intensive operation,
    for whatever reason, so, using the default values and some DHCP activity your
    CPU usage will spike to 100% every 5 minutes.<BR/><BR/>Writing to flash seems
    to be much better in this regard.'
