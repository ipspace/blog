  html: Whats the meaning of the prepending 01 anyway? if I do a 'show ip dhcp binding'
    i see some mac's with the usual xxxx.xxxx.xxxx and some with the prepending 01,
    making them 01xx.xxxx.xxxx.xx. Thanks. :)

  html: 'The DHCP RFCs recommend that the hardware type should be prepended to the
    MAC address in client identifier to ensure that two MAC addresses would not accidentally
    end up as the same client identifier due to little/big endian bit ordering.<BR/><BR/>The
    <A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1533.html" REL="nofollow">DHCP Options RFC</A>
    says in section 9.12: <I>It is expected that this field will typically contain
    a hardware type and hardware address, but this is not required.</I> So, the more
    strictly conformant DHCP client implementations will prepend 01 to the MAC address,
    others might choose not to do so.<BR/><BR/>The hardware type is defined in <A
    HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1340.html" REL="nofollow">Assigned Numbers RFC</A>,
    well hidden in the  <I>ARP Parameters</I> section.'

  html: Some HP network printers/printservers  (ethernet!) prepend 00 instead of 01.
    Some don't prepend anything so only hardware-address is working with them.

  html: 'Hm. One of the limitations/issues I''ve run with the IOS DHCP server and
    setting up a reservation is that it only accepts on "client-identifier" per pool.<BR/><BR/>Picture
    this: AP to switch. router on same VLAN. Notebook with wireless and wired cards.
    You want for the notebook to get the same IP address no matter if the connection
    is wired or wireless. Tough luck - just one "client-identifier" per pool.<BR/><BR/>The
    use of a locally administered MAC address could solve my problem - if I used the
    same MAC for both the wired _and_ the wireless interface. Have to try and see
    what Vista thinks of it ;)'

  html: to set the client id on XP go to a command line and use ipconfig /setclassid
    "adaptername" asciisgtring<BR/><BR/>where adaptername is the name of the adapter
    in your network interfaces and asciistring is the string you want.<BR/><BR/>no
    idea if it works with cisco dhcp yet.  have not tried it.

    Nothing is working hardware-address, client-identifier, no prepend, 01 prepend,
    00 prepend<BR/><BR/>Who can help me?

  html: For old HP printer/Jetdirect, use &quot;hardware-address&quot; with no prepend.

  html: If you use a locally-administered MAC address as per this article, is it still
    unwise to use DHCP to assign layer-3 addresses to a server?
