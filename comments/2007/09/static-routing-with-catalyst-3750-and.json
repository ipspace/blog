      "html": "About STP I don't really know why you wouldn't use that. If I understand that scenario, you have switches on both ends of the link.  If you lost connectivity on fiber you won't get BPDUs on both ends of the link, so switches will choose link with next cost, so only thing you need to do is alter stp cost on ports which are backup.<BR/><BR/>About etherchannel it probably won't work in that case (backup on a radio?), because I was trying to make etherchannel over two wireless Proxim Tsunami links and it wasn't working properly (i guess because of latency which breaks LACP).",

I have many fiber mediaconverters (but mostly unused now because using gbics) and if you unplug one  fiber (TX for example), whole link goes down.<BR/><BR/>Next thing: you receive bpdus on TWO ports - one from radio, second from fiber. If you stop getting BPDUS from fiber, It will elect new root on radio port. It will also \"see\" MACs of other side on radio port, not fiber port. So it will send traffic trough radio, but it is true it won't block port of fiber.",
