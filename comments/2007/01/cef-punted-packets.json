Users using pptp to go in internet.<br />And i have many-many punted packets (about 1-10 kpps in fast-switched cpu-queue), that destinated to some users.<br />I make SPAN-session, and don&#39;t see any reason for &quot;punting&quot; them - it is regular torrent traffic (lot of udp packets and tcp-sessions).<br />And here is something strange - count of sw-forwarded packets is not equal with table &quot;show cef not-cef-switched&quot;.<br />Can you help me understand the reason of that situation.",
