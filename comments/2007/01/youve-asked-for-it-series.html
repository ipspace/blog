            <div class="comment-content">Hello Ivan. Thanks for all your blogs. I'm currently struggling with TCL and EEM on a cisco6500 and have found much valuable information here. However, there's an issue I cannot seem to solve and I was wondering if you knew some remedy.<BR/><BR/>The problem is that I am trying to write an already set eem variable from within a tcl script. Let's call it action_flag1. It is of boolean value and I can well read it  in my script. Problem is, I can't change the variable to a different value. Everytime I try to, it seems like the interpreter creates a new variable under the same name that is only visible during runtime. The only workaround I've figured out so far is pretty dowdy: cli_exec the commands <BR/><BR/>#enable<BR/>#conf t<BR/>#event manager variable action_flag1 [value].<BR/><BR/>...that does the trick but maybe you know a more elegant way?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I have generally seen that generally the vendors do not guarantee full bandwith. They say only 85-90% of the bandwidth is usable for data traffic and the rest is not guaranteed as it is used by network overheads? I couldn&#39;t find any answer for this network overheads. Can you please tell me what other overheads come into picture from the service provider end.<br /><br />Thanking you in anticipation...</div>
