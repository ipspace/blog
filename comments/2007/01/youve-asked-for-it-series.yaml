  html: 'Hello Ivan. Thanks for all your blogs. I''m currently struggling with TCL
    and EEM on a cisco6500 and have found much valuable information here. However,
    there''s an issue I cannot seem to solve and I was wondering if you knew some
    remedy.<BR/><BR/>The problem is that I am trying to write an already set eem variable
    from within a tcl script. Let''s call it action_flag1. It is of boolean value
    and I can well read it  in my script. Problem is, I can''t change the variable
    to a different value. Everytime I try to, it seems like the interpreter creates
    a new variable under the same name that is only visible during runtime. The only
    workaround I''ve figured out so far is pretty dowdy: cli_exec the commands <BR/><BR/>#enable<BR/>#conf
    t<BR/>#event manager variable action_flag1 [value].<BR/><BR/>...that does the
    trick but maybe you know a more elegant way?'

  html: There is a more elegant way (or at least I suspect there is), but I have to
    test it first. Will write a blog post when I get the results.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I have generally seen that generally the vendors do not
    guarantee full bandwith. They say only 85-90% of the bandwidth is usable for data
    traffic and the rest is not guaranteed as it is used by network overheads? I couldn&#39;t
    find any answer for this network overheads. Can you please tell me what other
    overheads come into picture from the service provider end.<br /><br />Thanking
    you in anticipation...
