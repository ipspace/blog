  html: Ivan,<br /><br />I believe the newer 1800/2800/3800 routers that come with
    SDM actually have default level 15 username/passwords configured of cisco/cisco.<br

  html: Checked it on IOS release 12.4(9)T - an SDM-enabled router ships only with
    preconfigured Ethernet interface and no passwords. SDM (or any other HTTP client)
    can connect to the IOS HTTP(S) server without authentication if the enable password
    is not configured.

  html: Oops ... reading the <A HREF="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/secursw/ps5318/products_quick_start09186a0080511c89.html"
    REL="nofollow">Cisco documentation</A> it looks like a router preconfigured for
    SDM Express actually has username/password set to <B>cisco</B>. All the other
    facts in my previous comment are still true, though :).

  html: Please see Cisco Bug ID's CSCse65910 and CSCek35024.  One is an AAA bug to
    add a 'one-time' keyword to the username config command and the other is a SDM
    bug to utilize the 'one-time' keyword.

  html: One trick which is worthwhile is to configure your own routers with a default
    username and password (eg &quot;user admin password blah&quot;). Then configure
    your RADIUS servers to deny access to that user ID. Configure your routers to
    check RADIUS, then the local usernames.<br /><br />The result is a default password
    which cannot be used whilst the device has connectivity.
