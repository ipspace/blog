However i'm trying to work out how to do this on a linux server using apache and a php script to receive the config and store it in a mysql database.<BR/><BR/>Have you tried this type of setup? As it seems that the cisco router sends half the config and then stops. I have tried searching for someone else thats tried this scenario but have come up empty handed. It would be appreciated if you had any insight into this problem.<BR/><BR/>Thanks",
