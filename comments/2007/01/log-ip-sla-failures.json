      "html": "Hi Ivan:<BR/><BR/>I read all your posts about EEM and they were great.<BR/><BR/>I would like to know if you have ever tried to use EEM to monitor a MOS score of an IP SLA UDP-Jitter instance. For example, if the MS score has fallen below certain number (say 2.50), some actions will be taken by the router to re-route traffic. I know OER is another option, but doing so will require the latest greatest IOS and meeting all the prereqs as defined by OER.<BR/><BR/>If you have any hints on using EEM to monitor MOS score I would certainly appreciate it. I am thinking about monitoring SNMP OID value of rttMonLatestJitterOperMOS, but didn't know how to tie it to an IP SLA instance #.<BR/><BR/>Thanks,<BR/><BR/>William Chu",
