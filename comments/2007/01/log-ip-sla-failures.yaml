  html: 'Hi Ivan:<BR/><BR/>I read all your posts about EEM and they were great.<BR/><BR/>I
    would like to know if you have ever tried to use EEM to monitor a MOS score of
    an IP SLA UDP-Jitter instance. For example, if the MS score has fallen below certain
    number (say 2.50), some actions will be taken by the router to re-route traffic.
    I know OER is another option, but doing so will require the latest greatest IOS
    and meeting all the prereqs as defined by OER.<BR/><BR/>If you have any hints
    on using EEM to monitor MOS score I would certainly appreciate it. I am thinking
    about monitoring SNMP OID value of rttMonLatestJitterOperMOS, but didn''t know
    how to tie it to an IP SLA instance #.<BR/><BR/>Thanks,<BR/><BR/>William Chu'

  html: This is really great. But what about if I define a trigger, for example when
    2 icmp packets get timeout. Do you know the OID that monitors this?<br /><br />Thanks
    very much.
