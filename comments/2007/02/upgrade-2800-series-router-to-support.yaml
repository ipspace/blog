  html: I just tested the link again and it shows me the files. Obviously what you
    see depends on your CCO user level; if you can't get the files on CCO, you'll
    have to contact your Cisco support partner.

    a notmal (non cisco) USB Flash Device) I do not get the USBFLASH option.<BR/><BR/>Does
    this only work with Cisco USB Flash drives ?

  html: 'I had a similar situation: The CLI help didn''t show it (at least until I''ve
    upgraded ROMMON, not sure what happened afterwards), but it worked. However, if
    you use this setup before upgrading ROMMON, the FLASH image boots first and then
    it loads the USBFLASH image.'

  html: You might want to format the flash card as Fat first.  Cisco doesn&#39;t understand
    ntfs.

  html: This did not work for me on the 2801. After it upgrades the rommon, it hangs
    on reboot and does not upgrade the rommon.

  html: You probably have to change the config register to 0x2102 (or something similar).
    Google for &quot;config-register&quot;

  html: 'After upgrading my 2811 with the new ROMMON, I was still having problems
    like this:<br /><br />rommon 4 &gt; dir usbflash0:<br />program load complete,
    entry point: 0x8000f000, size: 0x3d240<br /><br />*** TLB (Load/Fetch) Exception
    ***<br />Access address = 0x364<br />PC = 0x8003d878, Cause = 0x8, Status Reg
    = 0x3040a803<br /><br />monitor: command &quot;dir&quot; aborted due to exception<br
    /><br />The rommon could see the usbflash0: device, but didn&#39;t like the filesystem.<br
    /><br />I fixed it by blowing away all of the partitions on the USB disk (a 128MB
    relic) and creating one large partition using fdisk on linux. Set they type to
    6 (FAT 16). Then formatted the partition with &#39;sudo mkdosfs /dev/sdb1&#39;<br
    /><br />Now the ROMMON is perfectly happy with the filesystem:<br /><br />System
    image file is &quot;usbflash0:c2800nm-advipservicesk9-mz.151-4.M5.bin&quot;<br
    /><br /><br />Thanks, Ivan!'

  html: 'I had the same troubles as everyone above. I was trying to install a new
    ios, but my current CF did not have enough memory. I bought a new CF off ebay.
    I used a card reader on my PC and copied the new IOS onto the newly bought CF
    (was used on ebay). I placed in my router, but would only boot in rommon mode.
    My router already had the latest rommon version as described above. Router would
    not recognize my flash. I tried re-formatting on my pc (even though the was already
    configured for FAT - also tried FAT32), but still would not work. I tried a usb
    flash, but same thing until I used a really old usb (udisk 4GB), but even though
    dir usbflash: showed me my ios file, I still could not boot off of it - was getting
    same errors as above. <br /><br />Solution was I put the original flash/ios back
    in, turned on the router. I then used the router to re-format my usb while in
    enable mode. I then copied the new ios onto this usb using card reader on PC.
    I placed back into router and then with the router still on, I ejected the old
    flash/ios (making sure the light next to CF was off) and then placed the new flash
    in and then from enable mode formatted the new flash. I then copied the new ios
    from the usb to flash. I changed my configuration register back to 0x2102 from
    0x2101 (since I tried using the &quot;boot system&quot; command as described above).
    I reloaded my router and everything is good now.'
