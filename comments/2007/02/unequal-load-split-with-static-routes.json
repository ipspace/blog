      "html": "Hi Ivan,  nice web site!  I have a question a little off topic but sort of related;  many books and web sites state that the Administrative Distance of a static route pointing to an outgoing interface is 0,  however IOS shows that the AD is 1.  For example, this excerpt from Routing TCP/IP Vol 1 Second Edition,  Jeff Doyle,  Pg. 99;  \"For example, IPv4 static routes pointing to a next-hop address have an administrative distance of 1, and static routes referencing an exit interface have an administrative distance of 0\". At some point in the past was this true?  Do you know the history behind this?  Thanks.",

      "html": "Hello Ivan, I am going to attempt to apply your fancy static route method to my problem, but I wanted to throw a problem at you to see if I have missed some things.  I have a router which has two unequal paths being provided by the Satellite provider.  I connect to their network via GIG0/0 and GIG0/1.  The rates are 9mb and 3 mb respectively.  They allow me to use my own IP addresses due to the use of MPLS on their part.  I traverse their network to my remote router.  Right now I am only using the 9mb link with the 3mb as a failover.  I want to load balance across these two links but I have VOIP traffic.  I believe that if I allow this traffic along with the data to go through the load balancing, I will end up with to much jitter on the call because it will split routes.  Is there a way to force the VOIP to use one link while still running the load sharing protocol such as EIGRP with a variance.  As a side problem, I would also still want failover if I was to lose one link.  So the VOIP would have to be able to move.  Basically everyone needs to get out regaurdless of whether both links are up or just one with VOIP always having priority.  I have setup GRE tunnels on my one link to make the router see the ethernet connection for what it really is (9mb), but we really want to use the full 12mb or pretty close.",

The router on which this works is 2821 with 12.4(15)T7 with &quot;ip load-sharing per-packet&quot; on the interfaces, and the other side is CISCO7613 with 12.2(33r)SRB4 with only option of &quot;ip load-sharing per-destination&quot; on its ATM subinterfaces . Both have CEF enabled. the 7600 is sending out only on a single line<br /><br />thanks<br />Nick",
