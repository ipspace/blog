  html: Hi Ivan.<br /><br />Nice example!<br /><br />Is this possible through MPLS
    to? You shutdown a local interface, what if the routing beetween sites a down?<br

  html: With EEM3.0 (probably not available on a 6500 image) you can track routes
    per-protocol (so it would be possible to track a BGP route). With the track command
    you can only track the presence of an IP prefix in the IP routing table.

  html: Hi<br /><br />My scenario is that I have got a directly connected network
    to a 6500 switch.This switch has got a BGP relationship with another peer.If I
    start recieiving a BGP advertisement for the directly conected route from the
    peer I want to shut down the interface vlan SVI for the directly connected network.Since
    the route will not get installed in the routing table till a directly connected
    network is present.I will be tracking another route based on which I want to trigger
    this action.<br /><br />Thanks

  html: You could also track the state of the BGP neighbor (but then obviously you
    have to be sure the BGP neighbor will send the desired prefix). Would you be willing
    to share more information with me (your problem fits pretty nicely into a &quot;real-life
    example&quot; I was looking for)? If so, it would be best to send me an e-mail
    (the instructions are available through the &quot;Contact me&quot; link at the
    top of the page)

  html: Could this also be used with HSRP to track the presence of a default route
    learned from separate ISPs and then change states?
