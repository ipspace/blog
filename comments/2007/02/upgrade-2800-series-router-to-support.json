I used a card reader on my PC and copied the new IOS onto the newly bought CF (was used on ebay). I placed in my router, but would only boot in rommon mode. My router already had the latest rommon version as described above. Router would not recognize my flash. I tried re-formatting on my pc (even though the was already configured for FAT - also tried FAT32), but still would not work. I tried a usb flash, but same thing until I used a really old usb (udisk 4GB), but even though dir usbflash: showed me my ios file, I still could not boot off of it - was getting same errors as above. <br /><br />Solution was I put the original flash/ios back in, turned on the router. I then used the router to re-format my usb while in enable mode. I then copied the new ios onto this usb using card reader on PC. I placed back into router and then with the router still on, I ejected the old flash/ios (making sure the light next to CF was off) and then placed the new flash in and then from enable mode formatted the new flash. I then copied the new ios from the usb to flash. I changed my configuration register back to 0x2102 from 0x2101 (since I tried using the &quot;boot system&quot; command as described above). I reloaded my router and everything is good now.",
