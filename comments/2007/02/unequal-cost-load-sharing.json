      "html": "This sounds like a great feature. <BR/>Sorry for a newbie question but does ip cef take into account the bandwidth setting on an interface so that dissimilar speed interfaces can be proportionally load balanced?  I'm thinking about load sharing between an adsl and a cable modem. my application makes many connections to the same destination address so it would be nice to efficiently load share based on a source port.  Will OER work better in this case?",

In my testing scenarios the destination address of the tunnel are shown. Do you have any idea why it is 0.0.0.0? Maybe I got something wrong in my TE setup... Thanks a lot!!!",

Did you assign IP addresses to the tunnel interfaces? In any case, the tunnel interfaces are point-to-point, so the next hop is effectively ignored (it's important only on multi-access LAN/WAN interfaces).",
