      "html": "Hm. this didn't quite work for me on IOS 12.4(11)T:<BR/><BR/>a) the netmask is shown as \"/24\" in my \"show ip interface\" output rather than \"255.255.255.0\" that the script looks for (perhaps you'd changed your terminal settings with a \"terminal ip netmask-format decimal\"?) so I changed the regexp string to<BR/><BR/>{internet address is ([0-9.]+)/([0-9.]+)?}<BR/><BR/>b) on the line with an unnumbered interface, it says \"Interface is unnumbered. Using address of NVI0 (0.0.0.0)\" on my router(s) whereas the script is looking for something like \"Using address 0.0.0.0\" instead. so change the regexp string to<BR/><BR/>{Using address of .* \\((\\S+)\\)}<BR/><BR/>anyway, hopefully this helps anybody else if they're having trouble.<BR/><BR/>thanks for the tip though, and all the others - they're great reading! thanks, too, for confirming my theory that the ip dns view stuff is busted. now, if only the post-12.4(11)T release would turn up - it's been months!<BR/><BR/>cheers,<BR/> cos.",

      "html": "Somehow I've missed the <I>address/prefix</I> format (I have to check why I'm getting the <I>address mask</I> printout). Thanks for the fix, when I find some time, I'll integrate it with my code to have a script that works regardless of IP address format.<BR/><BR/>The other regexp was deliberate - if I have unnumbered interface, I wanted to see the name of the other interface (but, with your fix, you could see the IP address instead). I'll integrate your regexp into the code and make it conditional (so you could see one or the other).<BR/><BR/>Thanks for the fixes :)<BR/>Ivan",
