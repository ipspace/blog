  html: One thing you have to do if you use route-maps to control the injection of
    the default-route into ospf (and that I found out the hard way by contacting TAC):<BR/><BR/>You
    have to redistribute the networks you specify in the route-map into OSPF, too.<BR/><BR/>I
    use a "static" BGP-prefix from our Uplink in my route-map, and I have to redistribute
    this prefix into OSPF to make the default route work.<BR/><BR/>The reason for
    that (TAC explained) is, that there is no "new" default-route generated, but the
    network in the route-map is redistributed into OSPF and simultaneously overwritten
    into 0.0.0.0/0.

  html: Hi,<br /> why using the keyword &quot;always&quot; with the &quot;route-map&quot;?
    Using the route-map should generate the default when the route-map is satisfyed,
    regardless if another default is in the RIB.<br />Thanks,
