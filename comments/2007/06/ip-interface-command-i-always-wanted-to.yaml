  html: Hm. this didn't quite work for me on IOS 12.4(11)T:<BR/><BR/>a) the netmask
    is shown as "/24" in my "show ip interface" output rather than "255.255.255.0"
    that the script looks for (perhaps you'd changed your terminal settings with a
    "terminal ip netmask-format decimal"?) so I changed the regexp string to<BR/><BR/>{internet
    address is ([0-9.]+)/([0-9.]+)?}<BR/><BR/>b) on the line with an unnumbered interface,
    it says "Interface is unnumbered. Using address of NVI0 (0.0.0.0)" on my router(s)
    whereas the script is looking for something like "Using address 0.0.0.0" instead.
    so change the regexp string to<BR/><BR/>{Using address of .* \((\S+)\)}<BR/><BR/>anyway,
    hopefully this helps anybody else if they're having trouble.<BR/><BR/>thanks for
    the tip though, and all the others - they're great reading! thanks, too, for confirming
    my theory that the ip dns view stuff is busted. now, if only the post-12.4(11)T
    release would turn up - it's been months!<BR/><BR/>cheers,<BR/> cos.

  html: Somehow I've missed the <I>address/prefix</I> format (I have to check why
    I'm getting the <I>address mask</I> printout). Thanks for the fix, when I find
    some time, I'll integrate it with my code to have a script that works regardless
    of IP address format.<BR/><BR/>The other regexp was deliberate - if I have unnumbered
    interface, I wanted to see the name of the other interface (but, with your fix,
    you could see the IP address instead). I'll integrate your regexp into the code
    and make it conditional (so you could see one or the other).<BR/><BR/>Thanks for
    the fixes :)<BR/>Ivan

  html: Looks nice, the format output reminds me of the output from Alcatel switch.
