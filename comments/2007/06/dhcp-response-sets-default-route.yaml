  html: To fix the metric do this on the interface that the dhcp assignment is coming
    from:<br />interface Vlan2<br /> ip dhcp client default-router distance 200

    html: Sure. Don&#39;t specify the default gateway option in the DHCP server configuration.
      How to do that depends on the DHCP server you use.

  html: this solves my problem when having multiple interfaces configured as dhcp
    clients on different subnet.<br />on the other hand, is there anyway to set hdcp
    server side NOT to push default-gateway?<br /><br />Thanks!
