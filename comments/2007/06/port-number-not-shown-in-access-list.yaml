  html: '@Anonymous#2: Actually, that''s pretty much exactly what I''ve said :) The
    standard ACL cannot show port numbers because they are not examined by the standard
    ACL ... BUT (and this is a HUGE BUT :) the extended ACL shows port numbers in
    log printouts IF AND ONLY IF the ACL uses the port numbers in PERMIT/DENY statements
    (unless there is a weird interaction with some other packet forwarding function
    in late IOS releases :))'
