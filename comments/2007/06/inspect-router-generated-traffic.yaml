  html: Is this possible with ZBF?  SDM does not seems to provide only for limited
    router-generated inspection.

  html: Is it not right that you have to configure policy in both directions...out
    zone-self zone and self-out in order to sync the router with external ntp server
    as there is no inspect option only pass. 12.4(24)T...great site btw.
