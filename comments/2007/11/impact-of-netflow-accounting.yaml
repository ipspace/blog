  html: My apologies for the tangent I'm about to go down regarding NetFlow on an
    1800 series.  I've noticed <B>IP_Audit Trail</B> spikes CPU usage on the router
    and am wondering if switching to NetFlow will help to alleviate this issue while
    still providing quality reporting from the IOS firewall.  Any help here would
    be greatly appreciated.

  html: In my understanding, Netflow is more an accounting than an acceleration feature
    these days, but I could be completely wrong. If I'm not too far off, Netflow will
    not improve your firewall performance but increase the overall CPU utilization
    as the router has one extra step to do while forwarding the packets.<BR/><BR/>You
    could, however, use Netflow to figure out the top flows that cause the high CPU
    utilization. I would also log incoming ACL failures to see whether you're under
    a DoS attack.

  html: NetFlow is turning to be more of a traffic accounting and analysis technology.
    Quite a lot of people depend on NetFlow data for indepth traffic analysis and
    it also helps in finding security violations, DoS attacks and also capacity planning
    provided you have a good flow analyzer tool. You could try NetFlow Analyzer from
    ManageEngine. Nice and low cost with good features.

  html: I am wondering if it is possible to log every connection that has passed through
    the router for security reasons? In my particular case I am looking for a solution
    that could provide last 30 days of all connections which have passed through the
    router.

  html: ASA or SCE should be able to do it.
