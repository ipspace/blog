Is it missing something or would you like to see something else addressed ... I am always looking forward to new ideas for IP Corner articles :)",

      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I am having a hard time differentiating between load balancing and load sharing. Specifically referring to the note at the beginning of this article which says -<br /><br />&quot;Load sharing is the ability to distribute outgoing traffic (or influence the flow of incoming traffic) over multiple paths. Load balancing is the ability to split the load toward the same destination (host or IP prefix) over multiple paths.&quot;<br /><br />Can you please possibly explain the difference between the 2 statements as I seem to interpret it as being the same thing except for load sharing it uses the word &quot;distribute&quot; and for load balancing it uses the term &quot;split&quot;. <br /><br />In other explanations on various lists it seems that the way it has been described is that load balancing is dynamic in nature wheras load sharing is pre deterministic. Reference : http://markmail.org/message/kolb4itl3ubaehhl#query:difference%20between%20load%20sharing%20and%20load%20balancing+page:1+mid:kolb4itl3ubaehhl+state:results<br /><br />Thx.",

      "html": "It&#39;s a nuanced distinction and the definitions don&#39;t always agree ... for more confusion just throw OER aka PfR in the mix ;) I started my article with my understanding of the terms to let the readers know what we&#39;re discussing.<br /><br />Let me just give you a simple example: if you have two connections to the Internet using two upstream service providers, traffic to some destinations will use one link, traffic to other destinations the other, thus the total outbound load is shared between the links.<br /><br />However, due to EBGP limitations, you cannot (usually) reach the same destination through both links, which means that for a large host-to-host transfer all the packets will flow over the same link. This particular load will thus not be balanced across the links.<br /><br />Does this make sense?",
