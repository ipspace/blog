  html: The solution on CCO is great to ensure more optimal routing, but it looks
    like they forgot about the default routing of everything else.

  html: '@anonymous(2): You need another network in the IP routing table for the <I>ip
    default-network</I> to work. So you have to receive at least a few routes via
    BGP (to have them pointed toward the ISPs) and then you can use the default-network
    on a few of them.'

  html: Instead of typing the destination ip in the route specify the interface as
    done below.<BR/><BR/>ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 serial1/0<BR/>ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
    serial1/1 250<BR/><BR/>This will ensure that if the interface goes down it will
    be removed from the routing table, thus no black hole

  html: '@anonymous(3): If only life would be so simple ... if you lose the interface,
    you lose the next-hop as well, so both solutions work. The problem is if you lose
    the BGP peer, but not the physical interface (as I''ve written in the post).'

  html: I know someone in similar situation.  However they use a route server which
    gives them bgp routes with "next hops" that could change so the hard coding of
    upstream neighbors may change without notice.  They are not given any default
    routes.  Is there some way to do the same thing if there are potentially varying
    peers on the WAN ethernet side. ??

  html: I had a question similar to this, but it involved 2 routers that were multi-homed
    to both ISP&#39;s in a full-mesh.  I know this is probably a bit overkill, but
    I was trying to setup the most fault-redundant configuration possible that would
    survive both a router problem, as well as a service problem.  In this setup, ISP1
    is successfully sending a default-route to R1, but I&#39;m noticing that R1 is
    redistributing that static route back into BGP and sending it to ISP2, which now
    has a default static route pointing to R1.  I know I could filter this out, but
    my question is would there be a better way of doing this?

  html: I hope your observation is from a test lab. There are two serious mistakes
    in your setup:<br /><br />#1 - As a multihomed customer DO NOT EVER propagate
    transit routes between upstream ISPs.<br />#2 - As an ISP, DO NOT EVER accept
    routes not originating in the customer&#39;s AS from the customer.

  html: Then he&#39;s not a regular customer, but an ISP buying transit (or a reseller
    of your services or whatever) and you should treat him differently. At least I
    hoped that would be somewhat obvious.

  html: Interesting point - in this scenario, it would pay to BGP peer to the internet-facing
    interface (so, ebgp-multihop 3 or somecrap) ... so if the internet-facing interface
    goes down, so does the eBGP peer.

    is immediately reset due to fast failover (by default; adjustable). My IP Corner

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Suppose ISP 1 lose connectivity to upstream provider,using
    default originate command SP1 will continue to advertise default route to customer,
    and if customer prefers ISP1, it will lose connectivity to internet even if customer
    has  less preffered default route from ISP2. Am I right?

    html: The usual root cause of &quot;I can ping from the router, but not from the
      hosts&quot; problem is that the subnet the hosts reside in is not visible from
      the rest of the network. <br /><br />In your case, that would mean you&#39;re
      not advertising your IPv4 prefix to the rest of the Internet. Does this make
      sense?

    router see the internet over 2 ISPs but when I removed the default route I lost
    the connection to a lot of websites. A part of the internet is reachable. From
    router I can ping everything but not from networks behind it. Do you have any
    idea?<br /><br />Regards<br />Stellar
