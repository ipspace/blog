  html: hi, <BR/>sure it is interesting, but if you have config privilege (you can
    configure key chain) you don't need to know old passwords to recover it, you can
    change it .. :-)

  html: 'How about this scenario: you have a router configuration (including passwords)
    and another router on which you can enter the key-chain command (even Dynamips
    would do).'

  html: This is cool ! However I tried to decrypt an 128bit encrypted 7 WEP key (Aironet
    1130AG), no success...<br /><br />is it possible to decrypt it somehow?

  html: re&lt;&lt;to know old passwords to recover it, you can change it&gt;&gt;<br
    /><br />but what if you had a encrypted pre-share key that was the same an loaded
    on MANY routers... if you changed it you would break your vpn<br /><br />or also
    encrypted key for a WAP...<br /><br />with this you can read it if you have some
    how lost it<br /><br />i.e. its not JUST for passwords

    html: 'I know it&#39;s an old article and an old question. The NX-OS password
      scheme is a normal rotation cipher. This is the sequence:<br /><br />3 22 4

  html: Hi!<br /><br />On Nexus the &#39;password 7&#39; method seems to be a different
    one.<br />Here a password of &#39;cisco123&#39; encrypts to &#39;fewhg123&#39;.<br
    /><br />password required 7 fewhg123<br /><br />Any idea how this can be decrypted?
    Or what algorithm is used?<br />It&#39;s interesting, that the numeric values
    are unchanged.<br /><br />Ciao,<br />    Chris
