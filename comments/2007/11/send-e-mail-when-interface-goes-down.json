Instead, the body is appended to the end of the Subject: line, and the actual body of the message is empty.<BR/><BR/>Conditions:  This occurs when sending email from EEM applets.<BR/><BR/>Workaround:  Using an EEM TCL policy instead offers more flexibility when sending email.  See http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6017/products_feature_guide_chapter09186a00804d343f.html for more on writing EEM policies using TCL.",
