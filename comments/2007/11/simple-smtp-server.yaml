  html: Why not simply listen on 0.0.0.0 (any) IP address instead of resolving hostname
    to IP address of one interface?

  html: Right. 0.0.0.0. Maybe because the router also has external-facing interfaces,
    and Ivan doesn't want to become a free relay for SPAM ? :)<BR/><BR/>Listening
    on 0.0.0.0 is asking for trouble. bind to 127.0.0.1 if no need to accept outside
    connections. bind to specific interfaces otherwise. But try to avoid 0.0.0.0 ;)<BR/><BR/>""be
    conservative in what you generate, and liberal in what you accept.""<BR/><BR/>Going
    back to the SMTP "basic server" - I've had good results using the Mercury Mail
    MTA - since 1999, my "ligthweight mail server of choice for lab-related stuff"

  html: Great bluedaemon. But this is lab - the server would be running on workstation/laptop,
    not on a router. The server is only capable to dump incoming mail on standard
    output, not to store or relay them.

  html: '@anonymous(1): You can always run it with <B>smtpDump.pl 0.0.0.0</B>. You
    can also change the default behavior by replacing <I>hostname</I> with <I>"0.0.0.0"</I>
    in line 6 of the code.<BR/><BR/>@bluedemon: Thanks for the Mercury Mail MTA tip.
    Exactly what I''ve been looking for during the last few months.<BR/><BR/>@anonymous(4):
    Thanks for the bug report, I''ve fixed the code.'

  html: <A HREF="http://www.zaplana.net/Articles/index.asp?binary=RouterConfigs/smtpDump.zip"
    REL="nofollow">Zip  file</A> from your site still contains buggy version. The
    compiled version is very handy for me. Please fix it.

  html: '@Anonymous(5): Uploaded the fixed code in zip file.<BR/><BR/>... and why
    don''t you guys choose some unique identifier (just select "Other" in the identity
    field and type in whatever you feel like), this "anonymous(N+1)" stuff is getting
    tedious :('
