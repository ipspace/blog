  html: As an engineer on one of the 5 largest backbones in the world, I can tell
    you that IPv6 technology on the network side is stable and just works.  We have
    been dual-stack for about 5 years.  IPv6 from the network side is very simple.  I
    will tell you though that there is very little demand for IPv6 service and even
    less traffic.

  html: We are a small ISP and are running fully dual-stacked for 4 years now.<BR/><BR/>We
    started because of a customers request. Right now we get more and more requests
    for internet-access using ipv6, but as shawn said, the traffic ist still marginally.

  html: I was talking to a senior Cisco IPv6 guy recently, and he told me the first
    large production deployments of IPv6 will probably be in management networks.
    Specifically, he mentioned that Comcast is planning to deploy a native IPv6 management
    network, as they foresee needing upwards of 100 million addresses.

  html: . . . and Microsoft has been pushing with the IPv6 stack since XP, and now
    it comes by default enabled on Vista and 2003 - I would expect 2008 to follow
    suit. Linux distros have IPv6 enabled since . . . forever?<BR/><BR/>Time for enterprises
    to also say "hey, what the heck - we got it for free, let's leave it enabled and
    start running a trial - see how that goes".

  html: I tried setting up an IPv6 tunnel on an 1801.  The tunnel was set up and worked,
    but there were a couple of show stoppers:<BR/><BR/> - IPv6 only works with what
    cisco refer to as legacy firewall; it does not work with Zone-Based Firewall<BR/><BR/>
    - IPv6 does not work with BVI interfaces (you can't route bridged ipv6)

  html: Thanks for all the comments. I had no doubt that dual-stack IPv6 works in
    the network core; after all, Cisco has a very long highly successful history of
    supporting multiple simultaneous protocols in the core :) I am also positive that
    if you run IS-IS + BGP and deploy IPv6 toward enterprise customers (i.e. leased
    lines or LAN attachment), there are no surprises.<BR/><BR/>How about residential
    customers or SOHO offices? Anyone running IPv6 over DSL or cable? Dialup? IPv6
    with AAA/Radius server? Production firewalls?<BR/><BR/>And, last but definitely
    not least, we all know that the biggest hurdles will be the applications :(

  html: I think for us the networkers we need to get our hands dirty and start playing
    with IPv6. I don't recommend using your production network for this but may be
    a separate Internet connection and setup a public IPv6 tunnel to begin your IPv6
    adventure.<BR/><BR/>I setup my home router and connected to a free IPv6 tunnel
    broker. They provided me with a /64 (yes, /64, no kidding) for my LAN and I formed
    IPv6 BGP peering with their IPv6 router over the IPv6 GRE tunnel. I also enabled
    IOS IPv6 firewall but as of the latest IOS (12.4(15)T1) only basic TCP, UDP, and
    FTP are supported. On the LAN side you setup stateless DHCPv6 and enable your
    Windows XP or Vista to be dual-stack or just IPv6 only (only Vista can do that).
    I am still a novice in IPv6 but I must tell you that I have learned something
    from this home-lab  setup with a real IPv6 tunnel broker over the Internet.
