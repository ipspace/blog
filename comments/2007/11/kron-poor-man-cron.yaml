  html: This is tricky. If you use EEM Tcl policy, the answer is probably "yes" (although
    I haven't tested the cli_* routines yet), if you use earlies IOS releases, the
    answer is "maybe" (<B>typeahead</B> didn't work properly in some of them), if
    you use 12.4(15)T, the answer is "I don't know" as the rules controlling where
    you can run Tcl scripts have changed (for example, you cannot run them through
    web server anymore).<BR/><BR/>It looks like some tests will have to be done :)
