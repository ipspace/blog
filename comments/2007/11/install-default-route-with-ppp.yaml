  html: You have right but it doesn't works if I have ethernet as WAN interface. I
    mean clean ethernet, without pppoe.<BR/>Reliable static routing helps in this
    case.

  html: Also ran into an issue at home where CEF would not work if a static default
    route to the dialer interface was used. I changed <br /><br />ip route 0.0.0.0
    0.0.0.0 Dialer0<br /><br />to <br /><br />interface Dialer0<br />     ppp ipcp
    route default<br /><br />and cpu usage dropped a lot

    html: As always, it depends on what you&#39;re trying to do. If you want the default
      route to always point to Dialer0, then your solution works perfectly.

  html: Hello friends, Ivan, you are very intelligent.<br /><br />I have a question,
    Is it good if I use the static default route ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 Dialer0.
    Istead of ppp ipcp route default?<br /><br />Regards!

    html: '&quot;I could to ppp ipcmp route default on my primary and do a floating
      weighted static route on the secondary&quot; &lt;&lt; This should work. Do keep
      in mind the blog post is 10 years old and test first ;)<br /><br />&quot;...
      if my dsl goes down my ethernet bgp would just take over?&quot; &lt;&lt; assuming
      you&#39;re getting just the default route over BGP, otherwise the router would
      use the more-specific entries you get over BGP.'

  html: Hi Ivan, <br /><br />I am huge fan of yours, just to verify if I have 2 DSL
    links and I want to use one as primary, I could to ppp ipcmp route default on
    my primary and do a floating weighted static route on the secondary? or let us
    say I have an ethernet(bgp) + dsl service and I want to make the DSL as my primary,
    I could just use this as well and if my dsl goes down my ethernet bgp would just
    take over?
