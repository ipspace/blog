  html: Ivan:<BR/><BR/>Do you have any article (real-life) on BGP Multipath Load Sharing
    for Both eBGP and iBGP in an MPLS VPN environment? I am talking about EIBGP Multipath
    in a MPLS VPN environment and pros and cons from an implementation perspective.

    REL="nofollow">This document from Cisco</A> looks pretty good. Is it missing something
    or would you like to see something else addressed ... I am always looking forward
    to new ideas for IP Corner articles :)

  html: Thanks, Ivan, I will check it out. I was told that special attentions are
    required when enabling EIBGP Multipath with IP Multicast because of RD, however,
    I need to dig deeper to find out why.

  html: Load balancing with BGP is very difficult and even impossible to achive.<br
    />Lets take the usual scenario when a client with one or two routers connects
    to two different providers.<br />How are you load balancing the download which
    most of the time is what makes people say &quot;the internet is slow&quot;. You
    can&#39;t.

  html: 'Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I am having a hard time differentiating between load
    balancing and load sharing. Specifically referring to the note at the beginning
    of this article which says -<br /><br />&quot;Load sharing is the ability to distribute
    outgoing traffic (or influence the flow of incoming traffic) over multiple paths.
    Load balancing is the ability to split the load toward the same destination (host
    or IP prefix) over multiple paths.&quot;<br /><br />Can you please possibly explain
    the difference between the 2 statements as I seem to interpret it as being the
    same thing except for load sharing it uses the word &quot;distribute&quot; and
    for load balancing it uses the term &quot;split&quot;. <br /><br />In other explanations
    on various lists it seems that the way it has been described is that load balancing
    is dynamic in nature wheras load sharing is pre deterministic. Reference : http://markmail.org/message/kolb4itl3ubaehhl#query:difference%20between%20load%20sharing%20and%20load%20balancing+page:1+mid:kolb4itl3ubaehhl+state:results<br
    /><br />Thx.'

  html: 'It&#39;s a nuanced distinction and the definitions don&#39;t always agree
    ... for more confusion just throw OER aka PfR in the mix ;) I started my article
    with my understanding of the terms to let the readers know what we&#39;re discussing.<br
    /><br />Let me just give you a simple example: if you have two connections to
    the Internet using two upstream service providers, traffic to some destinations
    will use one link, traffic to other destinations the other, thus the total outbound
    load is shared between the links.<br /><br />However, due to EBGP limitations,
    you cannot (usually) reach the same destination through both links, which means
    that for a large host-to-host transfer all the packets will flow over the same
    link. This particular load will thus not be balanced across the links.<br /><br
    />Does this make sense?'
