I'll see if I can find an email address for you, Ivan, and send you one that actually works<BR/><BR/>* you forgot to mention Type 6 encryption - aka \"Encrypt Pre-shared Keys in IKE\" - again, tinyurl to the rescue: http://tinyurl.com/3dj6az<BR/><BR/>* and considering we're talking about passwords - how about mentioning also the \"no service password-recovery\" feature? - http://tinyurl.com/yptmfx<BR/><BR/>I don't write about quantum physics because I know zilch about it. Nick should follow my example and not write about IOS and security ;)",

The type-6 encryption stuff is particularly interesting; too bad they are not using it for all password encryption (they could, as it's reversible). But then I guess some IOS development groups don't talk to each other.<BR/><BR/>A post about \"no service password-recovery\" (and its interesting side-effects on some platforms) is in the queue.<BR/><BR/>And, last but not least, don't be so hard on Nick :) It's always good to see the world from a different perspective (and this particular perspective shows that Cisco should be more aggressive in documenting their security recommendations).",

You can pretty much take a 10 year old config and dump it on a new device and it will still work.  The best thing they could do is put out a notice that the older commands are now deprecated and you should use the new syntax.",
