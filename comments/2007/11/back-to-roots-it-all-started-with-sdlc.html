            <div class="comment-content">For the record the original NP-2T Two-Port Serial module for the old Cisco 4000 series routers also need to change hardware jumpers if you want to enable NRZI. Starting with the NP-4T module Cisco began to support software-selectable NRZI control from the IOS CLI. Also, the older Cisco 3000 series routers only supported NRZ only; there was no NRZI support until the 3104 and 3204 models were released.<BR/><BR/>I like the LFI solution because in most cases if we are doing VoIP LFI would be required anyway for circuit speed that is below 768K. For circuit speed like fractional DS3 or full DS3 we can enable scrambling to overcome the long string of zeros.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">That was a good one, I completely forgot about bit stuffing. :)<BR/><BR/>Note that Wikipedia NRZI article you refer to gives an example where transition happens on 1s, which wouldn't help. SDLC's NRZI has transition on 0s.</div>
