I've noticed <B>IP_Audit Trail</B> spikes CPU usage on the router and am wondering if switching to NetFlow will help to alleviate this issue while still providing quality reporting from the IOS firewall.  Any help here would be greatly appreciated.",

      "html": "In my understanding, Netflow is more an accounting than an acceleration feature these days, but I could be completely wrong. If I'm not too far off, Netflow will not improve your firewall performance but increase the overall CPU utilization as the router has one extra step to do while forwarding the packets.<BR/><BR/>You could, however, use Netflow to figure out the top flows that cause the high CPU utilization. I would also log incoming ACL failures to see whether you're under a DoS attack.",

      "html": "NetFlow is turning to be more of a traffic accounting and analysis technology. Quite a lot of people depend on NetFlow data for indepth traffic analysis and it also helps in finding security violations, DoS attacks and also capacity planning provided you have a good flow analyzer tool. You could try NetFlow Analyzer from ManageEngine. Nice and low cost with good features.",
