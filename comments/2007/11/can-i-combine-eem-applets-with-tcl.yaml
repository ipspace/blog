    it for monitoring of multicast traffic.

  html: Is there any way to create the Tcl script from the router CLI?<BR/><BR/>I'm
    using Dynagen to learn the EEM.  Don't want to connect the Dynagen routers to
    my network, and accidentally have one of my test labs affect the network.<BR/><BR/>For
    a quick short Tcl script it would be convenient to be able to create the script
    from the router CLI.

  html: '@anonymous: If you find a Tcl-based text editor and install it on your router,
    then you''ll be able to create any text file (including Tcl script) from the CLI.
    No, I haven''t found it yet.<BR/><BR/>As for the other part of your question,
    search the forums about the use of loopback interface.'

  html: There is a TCL based version of ed that I have.  Of course ed has a very steep
    learning curve and is difficult even for most well versed cli folks to use unless
    they have been using UNIX since the mid-70's.  I can send it to you if you are
    interested.  I use it on nearly a daily basis to change EEM scripts on my lab
    routers.

  html: If you have a ios 12.3(2)T version or above you should have a tcl shell in
    your ios. Just type tclsh and start scripting.<BR/><BR/>I would like to put a
    question as well.<BR/>I can combine eem applets with tcl scripts. But, if I want
    to start the tcl script based on the syslog msg?<BR/>How can I get the syslog
    message into the script?<BR/><BR/>Thanks,<BR/><BR/>Gustavo

  html: 'gustavo: If you have applets (i.e. EEM) and you have Tcl it''s easier to
    just use an EEM Tcl script to do that.  Tcl in EEM has added the event_reqinfo
    command which can be called to get info about the event that triggered the script
    to be run and one of the items in the list that is returned is msg which contains
    the message that caused the policy to be triggered.<BR/><BR/>If you really do
    want to pass the syslog message to a "pure" Tcl script, the tclsh accepts arguments
    after the filename so you may be able to pass something in there from the applet.  For
    example, applets that were triggered by the syslog event detector will have the
    $_syslog_msg variable set.  So you could use that variable in the applet.  I have
    never tried it, but it might be possible.'

  html: To increase the number of VTY lines, use the "line vty" configuration command,
    specifying higher upper limit (for example, <B>line vty 0 50</B>). If you've changed
    the default configuration of VTY lines 0-4, you have to change the configuration
    of lines 5-50 as well.<BR/><BR/>To change the default timeout, use the <B>maxrun</B>
    parameter in the <B>event_register_xxx</B> line in your Tcl policy.

  html: Another approach to achieve the same, but without an external TCL script can
    be done with the following config:<br /><br />event manager applet t<br /> event
    none<br /> action 1.0 cli command &quot;enable&quot;<br /> action 2.0 cli command
    &quot;tclsh&quot;<br /> action 2.1 cli command &quot;typeahead \&quot;y\&quot;
    ; exec \&quot;clear counter\&quot;&quot;<br /> action 3.0 cli command &quot;exit&quot;

  html: Vayner&#39;s above tcl in an eem script looks interesting, but I can&#39;t
    get it to work. It would be nice to be able to have the ability to embed it into
    the config file and not a separate script.<br /><br />Can anyone verify the syntax?
    I can get it to work on the console, but not in eem

  html: "Hi all, <br />I have an issue with trying to create a script that will handle\
    \ the &quot;yes/no&quot; question that arises during the shutting down of a active\
    \ Transcoder.<br />What I need to perform via a TCL script is:<br />conf t<br\
    \ />dspfarm profile 8 trancode<br />shutdown<br />exit<br />exit<br /><br /><br\
    \ />Of course a typeahead &quot;yes\\n&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to help due, perhaps\
    \ due to the fact that the ios_config uses a separate VTY context to issue the\
    \ its commands.<br /><br />I have tried to use the EEM with no success:<br />\
    \ event manager applet disableProf <br />    event none <br />    action 1.0 cli\
    \ command &quot;conf t&quot;<br />    action 1.1 cli command &quot;dspfarm profile\
    \ 8 transcode&quot;<br />    action 1.2 cli command &quot;yes\\n&quot;<br /> \
    \   action 1.3 cli command &quot;exit&quot;<br />    action 1.4 cli command &quot;exit&quot;<br\
    \ /><br />But the transcoder profile remains active.<br /><br />It seems user\
    \ prompt questions within the processing via the &quot;exec&quot; construct seems\
    \ to be possible to handle, however does anyone know of a way to programmatically\
    \ answer prompted questions with the &quot;ios_config&quot; construct ?<br /><br\
    \ />If the answer is no, then can anyone think of other ways to shutdown a transcoder\
    \ profile ? (could it be achieved via TCL via the SNMP accessing functionality?<br\
    \ /><br />Here is the actually prompt text for those who haven\u2019t seen a prompted\
    \ question within the conf t prompt:<br />Router(tcl)#ios_config &quot;conf t&quot;\
    \ &quot;dspfarm profile 8 transcode&quot; &quot;shutdown&quot; &quot;exit&quot;<br\
    \ />Disabling profile will disconnect active TRANSCODING calls,<br />do you want\
    \ to continue ? [yes/no]<br /> Must be yes or no<br /><br /><br />Thanks for all\
    \ that read this. <br />Thanks to Ivan for his excellent blog space."
