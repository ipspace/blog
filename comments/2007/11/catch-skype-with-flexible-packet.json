      "html": "This bug is for the built-in IOS PDLM support of Skype...Please note in my config I don't reference the built-in PDLMs with the \"match protocol skype\" command. For instance you will run into this bug if you use a config such as:<BR/><BR/>class-map match-any block-stuff<BR/> match protocol gnutella<BR/> match protocol skype<BR/> match protocol edonkey<BR/>!<BR/>!<BR/>policy-map drop-inbound-stuff<BR/> class block-stuff<BR/>   drop<BR/>!<BR/>...<BR/>This is completely different technology from the configuration which I detail. Please note that I use Flexible Packet Matching which is a next-generation technology that is capable of filtering at a bit-level to catch later versions of Skype...You can also use the Skype.tcdf (XML scripting) file available on CCO @ http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/fpm which will catch later versions of Skype as well...Please reference the following docs for additional details:<BR/><BR/>http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6441/products_feature_guide09186a00805138d3.html<BR/><BR/>http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6441/products_feature_guide09186a008061d643.html<BR/><BR/>-Joe",
