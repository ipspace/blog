We have been dual-stack for about 5 years.  IPv6 from the network side is very simple.  I will tell you though that there is very little demand for IPv6 service and even less traffic.",

Specifically, he mentioned that Comcast is planning to deploy a native IPv6 management network, as they foresee needing upwards of 100 million addresses.",

I had no doubt that dual-stack IPv6 works in the network core; after all, Cisco has a very long highly successful history of supporting multiple simultaneous protocols in the core :) I am also positive that if you run IS-IS + BGP and deploy IPv6 toward enterprise customers (i.e. leased lines or LAN attachment), there are no surprises.<BR/><BR/>How about residential customers or SOHO offices? Anyone running IPv6 over DSL or cable? Dialup? IPv6 with AAA/Radius server? Production firewalls?<BR/><BR/>And, last but definitely not least, we all know that the biggest hurdles will be the applications :(",

      "html": "I think for us the networkers we need to get our hands dirty and start playing with IPv6. I don't recommend using your production network for this but may be a separate Internet connection and setup a public IPv6 tunnel to begin your IPv6 adventure.<BR/><BR/>I setup my home router and connected to a free IPv6 tunnel broker. They provided me with a /64 (yes, /64, no kidding) for my LAN and I formed IPv6 BGP peering with their IPv6 router over the IPv6 GRE tunnel. I also enabled IOS IPv6 firewall but as of the latest IOS (12.4(15)T1) only basic TCP, UDP, and FTP are supported. On the LAN side you setup stateless DHCPv6 and enable your Windows XP or Vista to be dual-stack or just IPv6 only (only Vista can do that). I am still a novice in IPv6 but I must tell you that I have learned something from this home-lab  setup with a real IPv6 tunnel broker over the Internet.",
