            <div class="comment-content">@edouard/jeremy: Stealing from a feed <I>with automatic tools</I> is way simpler than stealing from a web page, as the post content is nicely formatted and ready to be published (enclosed within well-known XML tags), whereas you have to parse HTML and find where the content is if you want to copy-paste from the web page.<BR/><BR/>BTW, we're talking about large-scale scam here, not simple stealing of a post or two. Look at these URLs:<BR/><BR/>http://rg443.1gb.in/WordPress/?s=IOS<BR/>http://a0000.blogspot.com/search?q=IOS<BR/>http://x443.spaces.live.com/<BR/><BR/>This ***** is stealing 150 posts per day from various blogs. I am almost positive he's not investing his time in copy/paste operation. Or am I just over-reacting?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Short content, means more clicks to read, which means why bother posting it as a blog in the first place.  You may as well post it on a webpage.<BR/><BR/>The whole idea of a block is that you get headlines or articles that you can then subscribe to.  Personally, I read many of these offline, so a short (headline only) post is totally useless.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">@anonymous(the-last-one): to be honest, the only reason I've started a blog was because the publishing process (and a few extras like archive-table-of-content and categories listing) was easier than if I would create my own web site (but I am slowly regretting the decision, based on how limited Blogger is). <BR/><BR/>However, I hear loud and clear what you're saying about offline reading, so if I decide to go with the feed in short format, I'll make sure you'll still get the content in suitable form.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I much prefer full content. Only a few feeds I read give just a few lines, and I invariably like them far less because they force me to click through to read it. The name of the web is still about ultra-accessibility and speed. The more clicks or hunting, the less interest and hits, especially when one reads a lot of sites in a reader...<BR/><BR/>In regards to the stealing of content, that's terribly unfortunate and really sucks. I definitely don't agree with such theft. However, on the other hand, what are you truly losing by this spammer adding you to his/her list of blogs they scrape for their splog? I know, I know, it's your words and content...but, I wonder if one can just let it go? Maybe put your name in the text at the bottom of each post, that way they also grab it each time?<BR/><BR/>Regardless what you do, great blog and amazingly useful!</div>
