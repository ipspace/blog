      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br />First of all thanks for a great Blog.Even though this post is old,I still want to comment on it the same,because I spent a few hours trying to figuring out why I was getting any syslog <br /><br />messages.<br /><br />1. The MOS threshold-value is the MOS score (5.0 - 1.0) an not milliseconds.<br />2. IP sla &quot;reaction-configuration&quot; send SNMP traps mainly but strangely, to send traps you will need this command &quot;ip sla monitor logging traps&quot; and get syslog messages this <br /><br />command &quot;snmp-server enable traps syslog&quot;<br /><br />Keep up the good work and best regards<br />Glanglan",

      "html": "I know this is an old post, but I hoping someone could help. I&#39;ve configured my router this same way but am not having success with the reaction-configuration working more than once. For example, once the threshold is exceeded, I get a syslog message. But after that one time, I can no longer get them to generate. To generate the message, on the far end responder, I simply put up an inbound acl to block the udp packets coming in from the probe. This generates the message on the probe. Removing the ACL allows the probe to read jitter again, but regardless of how many times i use the ACL to block/unblock, i no get any more messages.<br /><br />--message i get<br />*Sep 13 15:07:56.299: %RTT-3-IPSLATHRESHOLD: IP SLAs(12): Threshold exceeded for jitterSDAvg<br /><br />",
