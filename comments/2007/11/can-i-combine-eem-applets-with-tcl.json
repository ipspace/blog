Tcl in EEM has added the event_reqinfo command which can be called to get info about the event that triggered the script to be run and one of the items in the list that is returned is msg which contains the message that caused the policy to be triggered.<BR/><BR/>If you really do want to pass the syslog message to a \"pure\" Tcl script, the tclsh accepts arguments after the filename so you may be able to pass something in there from the applet.  For example, applets that were triggered by the syslog event detector will have the $_syslog_msg variable set.  So you could use that variable in the applet.  I have never tried it, but it might be possible.",
