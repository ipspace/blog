In this setup, ISP1 is successfully sending a default-route to R1, but I&#39;m noticing that R1 is redistributing that static route back into BGP and sending it to ISP2, which now has a default static route pointing to R1.  I know I could filter this out, but my question is would there be a better way of doing this?",
