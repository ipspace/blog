  html: Based on "debug ppp negotiation" it looks like both ends treat the connection
    as "dial-in". The only way to have one-way PAP is to configure "ppp authentication
    pap optional" on one end.

  html: I used the AUX port on the router and connect them together using a null modem
    cable. If you really want to simulate dialup you can do dialer profile and put
    the AUX port in a dialer pool and create a dialer interface and associate the
    dialer pool to it. You can then enable ppp and all related PPP configs.

  html: Using clear interface Serial1/0 is more convenient way to force ppp renegotiation
    than shutdown and no shutdown in sequence.

  html: IMHO, on &quot;client&quot; side you don&#39;t need &quot;ppp authentication
    pap&quot; command as it demands *peer* (your &quot;server&quot;) to authenticate...
