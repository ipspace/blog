  html: 'Watch out for:  (12.4.15T1)<BR/><BR/>CSCsl53037: Mail action does not separate
    headers from body<BR/><BR/>Symptom:  Emails originating from Embedded Event Manager
    (EEM) applets do not have proper subject and body components.  Instead, the body
    is appended to the end of the Subject: line, and the actual body of the message
    is empty.<BR/><BR/>Conditions:  This occurs when sending email from EEM applets.<BR/><BR/>Workaround:  Using
    an EEM TCL policy instead offers more flexibility when sending email.  See http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6017/products_feature_guide_chapter09186a00804d343f.html
    for more on writing EEM policies using TCL.'

    html: 'If you would have read this: http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=13287
      you&#39;d discovered Gmail requires SSL/TLS encryption on SMTP sessions, which
      is not supported by Cisco IOS.<br /><br />Register a domain (costs a few $$$
      per year) with someone that supports email forwarding.'
