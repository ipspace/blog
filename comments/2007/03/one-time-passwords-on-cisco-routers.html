            <div class="comment-content">Actually, the first thing SDM does is ask the user to change the default credentials - so if the user does use SDM for initial/subsequent configuration, the credentials would be removed. The problem is if the customer got SDM installed on the device from manufacturing, and used some script/CLI to reconfigure the device - and never ever starts SDM - SDM never gets the chance to remove the default credentials.<BR/>This issue was fixed by CSCse65910 - additional information can be found at http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sr-20070215-http.shtml<BR/><BR/>And while it is true the default credentials are removed from the running-config and not the startup-config, this isn't a problem - we can assume whoever used the credentials is going to change the configuration, and save it :)<BR/><BR/>If they do NOT, the credentials aren't valid anymore. If the device  is reloaded, agreed, credentials are still there - but you would still be using the default configuration, without any of the previously applied changes (ie: default IP addressing information, no outside connectivity). So this isn't really an issue.<BR/><BR/>And about "if you login to the device using another combination" - how, if only the default one is available? and dissapears once used for the 1st time? And it's only going to reappear if you don't save the configuration - which hence means no additional username/password combinations created on the device?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The problem with "if you login to the device using another combination" is that you can connect to the console port (assuming it's not protected with <B>login local</B>, of course), configure your router from there and still leave the default password in the configuration.<BR/><BR/>I'm not saying that the feature as implemented now is not OK, it functions as designed and it can be extremely useful ... it's just that it could be made even more secure if the one-time username would disappear when the first exec process is started (regardless of how the user got into the box).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I am using  cisco 2801, this  router that has the SDM Ô¨Åles already installed on it. After i console into the router, the router asks for username and password, i entered cisco/cisco by default. Next,  i configured the  interface ip address, then i  run command &quot;copy run st&quot;,  but i forgot to remove the default username cisco or  create a new username and password. <br /><br />After that, i console into the router again, the router asks for username and password again and i enter cisco/cisco. It doesn&#39;t work. <br /><br />What should i do to solve this problem ?</div>
