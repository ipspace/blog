  html: 'Actually, the first thing SDM does is ask the user to change the default
    credentials - so if the user does use SDM for initial/subsequent configuration,
    the credentials would be removed. The problem is if the customer got SDM installed
    on the device from manufacturing, and used some script/CLI to reconfigure the
    device - and never ever starts SDM - SDM never gets the chance to remove the default
    credentials.<BR/>This issue was fixed by CSCse65910 - additional information can
    be found at http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sr-20070215-http.shtml<BR/><BR/>And
    while it is true the default credentials are removed from the running-config and
    not the startup-config, this isn''t a problem - we can assume whoever used the
    credentials is going to change the configuration, and save it :)<BR/><BR/>If they
    do NOT, the credentials aren''t valid anymore. If the device  is reloaded, agreed,
    credentials are still there - but you would still be using the default configuration,
    without any of the previously applied changes (ie: default IP addressing information,
    no outside connectivity). So this isn''t really an issue.<BR/><BR/>And about "if
    you login to the device using another combination" - how, if only the default
    one is available? and dissapears once used for the 1st time? And it''s only going
    to reappear if you don''t save the configuration - which hence means no additional
    username/password combinations created on the device?'

  html: The problem with "if you login to the device using another combination" is
    that you can connect to the console port (assuming it's not protected with <B>login
    local</B>, of course), configure your router from there and still leave the default
    password in the configuration.<BR/><BR/>I'm not saying that the feature as implemented
    now is not OK, it functions as designed and it can be extremely useful ... it's
    just that it could be made even more secure if the one-time username would disappear
    when the first exec process is started (regardless of how the user got into the
    box).

  html: "I am using  cisco 2801, this  router that has the SDM \uFB01les already installed\
    \ on it. After i console into the router, the router asks for username and password,\
    \ i entered cisco/cisco by default. Next,  i configured the  interface ip address,\
    \ then i  run command &quot;copy run st&quot;,  but i forgot to remove the default\
    \ username cisco or  create a new username and password. <br /><br />After that,\
    \ i console into the router again, the router asks for username and password again\
    \ and i enter cisco/cisco. It doesn&#39;t work. <br /><br />What should i do to\
    \ solve this problem ?"
