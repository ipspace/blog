  html: There are a few variants of the basic hub-and-spoke approach, but more-or-less
    they all require a VRF per spoke site. The original architecture is described
    in the <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/MPLS-VPN-Architectures-Ivan-Pepelnjak/dp/1587050811"
    REL="nofollow">MPLS VPN Architectures</A> book and can be simplified if you can
    use default routing within VPN. Further enhancements are possible with VRF address
    selection or VRF selection with policy-based routing, but both options are pretty
    complex.<BR/><BR/>I'll write an article on these options in my <A HREF="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner"
    REL="nofollow">IP Corner column</A> and post a comment here when it's available.
