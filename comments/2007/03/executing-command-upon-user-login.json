However, I have a huge configuration that contains thousands of lines. Is there a way to display the whole configuration without having to hit the space bar everytime? Thanks again.",

      "html": "Ivan,<br /><br />I&#39;ve been playing around with this some and have made an interesting observation.  If I configure the line(s) with &#39;login local&#39; then the autocommand function works okay.  However, if I configure line authentication via a AAA login method (even though the AAA method specifies the local user database), the autocommand never executes.  Here&#39;s an example config of the latter:<br /><br />username IP password IP<br />username IP autocommand show ip int br<br />username CISCO password CISCO<br />!<br />aaa new-model<br />aaa authentication login CON line<br />aaa authentication login VTY local line<br />!<br />line con 0<br /> login authentication CON<br />line vty 0 4<br /> login authentication VTY<br /><br />I haven&#39;t been able to find anything in the documentation that helps me understand this behavior...can you provide any insight?<br /><br />Thanks!",
