  html: Thank you for all the guidance you provide on this site. I have configured
    autocommand to display the running config and it is working correctly. However,
    I have a huge configuration that contains thousands of lines. Is there a way to
    display the whole configuration without having to hit the space bar everytime?
    Thanks again.

  html: The command to disable page-by-page scrolling is "terminal length 0". If you
    want to combine it with another command in the autocommand environment, you have
    to <A HREF="http://blog.ioshints.info/2007/04/execute-multiple-commands-at-once.html"

  html: Ivan,<br /><br />I&#39;ve been playing around with this some and have made
    an interesting observation.  If I configure the line(s) with &#39;login local&#39;
    then the autocommand function works okay.  However, if I configure line authentication
    via a AAA login method (even though the AAA method specifies the local user database),
    the autocommand never executes.  Here&#39;s an example config of the latter:<br
    /><br />username IP password IP<br />username IP autocommand show ip int br<br
    />username CISCO password CISCO<br />!<br />aaa new-model<br />aaa authentication
    login CON line<br />aaa authentication login VTY local line<br />!<br />line con
    0<br /> login authentication CON<br />line vty 0 4<br /> login authentication
    VTY<br /><br />I haven&#39;t been able to find anything in the documentation that
    helps me understand this behavior...can you provide any insight?<br /><br />Thanks!

  html: Awesome, thanks for the response.  A debug showed that it skipped authorization,
    but didn&#39;t indicate anything that would have led me to this.<br /><br />Thanks
    again for the response, and this blog site!<br /><br />Jeff
