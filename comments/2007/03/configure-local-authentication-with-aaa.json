For example:<BR/><BR/>aaa new-model<BR/>aaa authentication login default group local<BR/><BR/>You can also use this in your corporate network:<BR/><BR/>aaa new-model<BR/>aaa authentication login default group TACACS+ local<BR/><BR/>No passwords on lines, no authentication commands on lines. Nice and clean.",

Do I need to add:<br />Line con 0<br />login auth default <br /><br />Will this allow me to log in via the console port and authenticate via radius if necessary?<br />Also, I have an emergency username configured at priv level 0 secret.  if AAA fails, will I still be able to access the device as login local is no longer an option under line con 0 since aaa has been configured.",
