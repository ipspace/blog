      "html": "There are a few variants of the basic hub-and-spoke approach, but more-or-less they all require a VRF per spoke site. The original architecture is described in the <A HREF=\"http://www.amazon.com/MPLS-VPN-Architectures-Ivan-Pepelnjak/dp/1587050811\" REL=\"nofollow\">MPLS VPN Architectures</A> book and can be simplified if you can use default routing within VPN. Further enhancements are possible with VRF address selection or VRF selection with policy-based routing, but both options are pretty complex.<BR/><BR/>I'll write an article on these options in my <A HREF=\"http://www.nil.com/ipcorner\" REL=\"nofollow\">IP Corner column</A> and post a comment here when it's available.",
