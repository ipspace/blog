      "html": "Hi everyone, <br /><br />If I have two ISP with DHCP(that means two default routes) and I want to make one of those the Active ISP and another being the backup ISP, how can I achive that?<br /><br />Because &quot;ip dhcp-client default-router distance value&quot; changes the metric of ALL dhcp routes, so they both have the same metric, additionally using route-maps you cannot use &quot;set ip next-hop verify-availability&quot; because it is dynamic so you have to use set interface, and there is no Verify-availability for that. <br /><br />Any ideas?",
