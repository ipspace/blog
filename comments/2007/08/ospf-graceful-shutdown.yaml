  html: I have read few of the topics here and i found them quite useful. I have a
    question! Once someone asked me how would i go about routing protocol conversion!
    Say the current routing protocol is EIGRP and the goal is convert it to pure OSPF
    with the minimal amount of network disruption in both the HQ and the branch offices!
    Of course that was an awkward and interesting question at the same time! Interesting
    in a sense that it brings some problem without showing how the current network
    look like! and awkward in a sense that it would need a lot of thinking, understanding,
    and analysis of the current network design and goals and therefore cannot be answered
    on the spot!! I know for sure that there are some general guidelines and best
    practices which i would appreciate if you could shed some light on this topic!
    <BR/><BR/>Thank you very much!

  html: to the first commenter checkout Vijay Gill's presentation of how ATDN converted
    their backbone from OSPF to ISIS http://www.nanog.org/mtg-0310/gill.html<BR/><BR/>On
    our tier 1 ISP network prior to a router reload we set ISIS overload which is
    similar to the OSPF command noted above.  We also shut down all eBGP sessions.  We
    then reboot the router.  After the router comes back and ISIS and MPLS-TE are
    reestablished we bring eBGP back up.

  html: There's a similar technique for IS-IS. What about EIGRP?

  html: There is no similar functionality for EIGRP. The only thing you could do is
    to lower the bandwidth on all EIGRP-enabled interfaces.

  html: 'A side remark for the first commenter: I just wrote an article describing
    a potential routing protocol migration scenario (it''s a bit different from the
    ATDN one, as it involves EIGRP-to-OSPF migration). If you''d like to receive it
    before it''s published, go to my <A HREF="http://www.zaplana.net/Articles/about.asp"

  html: Will the max-metric also work for external routes (thinking about the default
    here)?<BR/><BR/>Thanks!

  html: This is a great question (and a tricky one). Graceful shutdown (setting interface
    metric to 64K) will only influence E1 routes, as their cost is added to the internal
    cost. If you announce the default as an E2 route, the internal cost to the ASBR
    is ignored. <BR/><BR/>When I get some time, I'll produce router printouts documenting
    this.

  html: How do you do this gracefully with BGP?  I know I can shut the interface but
    there&#39;s still a lag..

  html: Configure an outbound prefix-list that filters all prefixes and do &quot;clear
    ip bgp * soft out&quot;. This will ensure all prefixes advertised by the BGP router
    are withdrawn.

  html: No, it doesn&#39;t. Setting all K values to 255 disrupts all adjacencies,
    resulting in potential packet loss until the network converges, while changing
    OSPF metric does disrupt the existing forwarding path until the network reconverges.
