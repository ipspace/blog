  html: 'Yeah, dunno where the heck that came from - using "cisco" and the dotted
    MAC. Oh well.<BR/><BR/>On a related note: the route that gets populated into the
    routing table has a distance of 254 - which is troublesome sometimes (ie: if you
    also have a static route with distance 254 pointing to null0, or if you want to
    use the DHCP route but are also receiving an alternate route via OSPF or EIGRP).<BR/><BR/>The
    solution - use the "ip dhcp-client default-router distance" global config command,
    and set the distance to something more rational - I personally use 250.<BR/><BR/>And
    no, messing with OSPF so the distance is 255 for received updates won''t work
    - 255 is "unreachable" . . . ;)'

  html: Note that if you have client-id cc05.12bc.0000 on your client ; on your server,
    you need to use client-id 01cc.0512.bc00.00.  So there's a 01 prefix to add on
    the server where 01 represents the Ethernet media type.
