      "html": "Yeah, dunno where the heck that came from - using \"cisco\" and the dotted MAC. Oh well.<BR/><BR/>On a related note: the route that gets populated into the routing table has a distance of 254 - which is troublesome sometimes (ie: if you also have a static route with distance 254 pointing to null0, or if you want to use the DHCP route but are also receiving an alternate route via OSPF or EIGRP).<BR/><BR/>The solution - use the \"ip dhcp-client default-router distance\" global config command, and set the distance to something more rational - I personally use 250.<BR/><BR/>And no, messing with OSPF so the distance is 255 for received updates won't work - 255 is \"unreachable\" . . . ;)",
