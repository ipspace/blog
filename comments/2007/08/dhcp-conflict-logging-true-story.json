For the last 10 years we used a single, centralized ISC DHCP server. Recently for various reasons too involved to explain here, it has become retarded. IN desperation I have enabled dhcp on all our 100 or so 6500s. We are not logging dchp conflicts, and so far all seems OK. However, I miss the extensive logging we used to obtain with ISC. I was thinking of enabling a DHCP db agent and turning on conflict logging, but your blog post above gives me pause. I&#39;ve been googling madly and can&#39;t find much info on the use of an external dhcp db server, or how to configure it.<br /><br />Is there a way to obtain more info about the dhcp bindings and clients without having either a single point of failure (the external db server) or worrying about the problems with conflicts you describe above?<br /><br />TIA,<br /><br />Steve",

               "html": "I think his answer is this....apparently when the WAPs were already active with an IP and the dhcp server was rebooted, the current WAPS IPs were placed into the exclusive list (address conflict) as the DHCP server attempted to distribute and address to a WAP requesting an IP. Once in that list I beleive the dhcp server will not give out that address even to the device that may be requesting to renew it&#39;s address with its same address. Hence the dhcp pool is reduced to the point that there are not even addresses to allocate. I think the DHCP server should recognize that a device requesting to renew its ip address should be regiven that same address along with deleting the address from the excluded list. I do not remember the dhcp packet commands in detail but I thought a renewing dhcp client shared the current IP address assigned to it with the server.   Too lazy to look it all up..sorry",

Unfortunately our department is going to be dealing with this A LOT more in the coming months so I&#39;m hoping you can provide more info.<br /><br />Our department is going to be installing and supporting WiFi for hotels around the country.  One of our installs this morning had a massive failure.  The site has ~50 WAPs in a /26 DHCP pool with 62 usable addresses.  When the router running the DHCP server reloaded it saw those 50 WAPs using the IPs they&#39;d been assigned and marked those IPs as conflcts.  That meant when it came time for the WAPs to release/renew their leases there were only ~10 IPs available in the pool.  We got a call from the site saying the whole site was down.<br /><br />What I don&#39;t understand is if this is how DHCP works, how does DHCP work at all?  I&#39;ve never heard of this happening before anywhere I&#39;ve worked and I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s because DHCP servers have never reloaded.  There has to be some workaround or something... can you please provide some info on this part of it?<br /><br />Thanks!<br />~Steve",
