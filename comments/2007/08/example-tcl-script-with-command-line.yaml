  html: Your version of IOS might support interface ranges in configuration mode,
    so you could use that.<br /><br />Or you could change the script. Like any other
    language, Tcl has loop constructs.

  html: Great script...used it on my router and working perfectly..<br /><br />However..
    I wanted to do the same thing with an interface of accesspoint..too bad.. This
    one is not supporting tcl scripts.. :(<br /><br />So what i was thinking... Is
    this script easy to edit that it can telnet to the accesspoint and push some cli
    commands.. Enable,conf t interface dot11radio0,shutdown ???<br /><br />Thankssss  :)

  html: Great scripts...  I was wondering.. Is it also possible to execute a script
    like this with a callmanager express by the phone? So for example you dial a number
    that activates this script... Will be great...then i can execute scripts without
    a pc  :-D

  html: Sure you can do that - IVR supports Tcl scripts.

  html: Ok,one step further.. i can now execute the command on my router... however..
    when i tried to put this to a dialpeer, i get the message could not load IVR script..
    <br /><br />So how can i use a tcl script with the ivr applications?<br /><br
    />Thanks
