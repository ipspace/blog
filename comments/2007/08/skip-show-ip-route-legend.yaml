  html: Thanks, Xavier, great idea ;). Your comment made me wonder how the <B>section</B>
    filter really works. I thought I knew how a <EM>section</EM> is defined, but obviously
    I was wrong. My impression was the a <EM>section</EM> is something that starts
    with a non-blank character in the first line, but your tip suggests the IOS actually
    knows which lines are related. Interesting ... is there any (semi)official explanation
    on this?<BR/><BR/>BTW, your filter does not include non-subnetted major networks,
    like<BR/><BR/>O    192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0<BR/>           [110/51] via 172.16.1.2,
    00:03:40, Serial0/0/0.100<BR/>           [110/51] via 10.0.0.6, 00:03:40, FastEthernet0/0

  html: You're right :-)<BR/><BR/>Here's the official documentation about the section
    keyword:<BR/><A HREF="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/partner/products/sw/iosswrel/ps5207/products_feature_guide09186a00801a7a94.html"
    REL="nofollow">Show Command Section Filter</A><BR/><BR/>It's not very detailed
    but at least, I've found that we can do <B>| section exclude <I>regexp</I></B>.  For
    example, <B>sh run | s e ^int|!"</B> might be useful when you have a lot of interfaces.

  html: Why does the output of &quot;show ip route&quot; command, sometimes show a
    particular network as varaibly subnetted and sometimes just subnetted? Also the
    line shows &quot;x&quot; subnets but the x does not match the number of subnets
