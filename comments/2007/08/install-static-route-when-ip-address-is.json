The only reason I can come up with for a config like that is if you have something like:<BR/><BR/>ip route 1.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 e0/0 172.16.0.22<BR/><BR/>in your configuration - and want to send any traffic to 1/8 to the bit bucket if the next hop goes down - but the interface stays up.<BR/><BR/>Does this work? which metric was used for the \"working\" route and for the \"non-working\" route?",
