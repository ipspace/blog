      "html": "I have read few of the topics here and i found them quite useful. I have a question! Once someone asked me how would i go about routing protocol conversion! Say the current routing protocol is EIGRP and the goal is convert it to pure OSPF with the minimal amount of network disruption in both the HQ and the branch offices! Of course that was an awkward and interesting question at the same time! Interesting in a sense that it brings some problem without showing how the current network look like! and awkward in a sense that it would need a lot of thinking, understanding, and analysis of the current network design and goals and therefore cannot be answered on the spot!! I know for sure that there are some general guidelines and best practices which i would appreciate if you could shed some light on this topic! <BR/><BR/>Thank you very much!",

      "html": "to the first commenter checkout Vijay Gill's presentation of how ATDN converted their backbone from OSPF to ISIS http://www.nanog.org/mtg-0310/gill.html<BR/><BR/>On our tier 1 ISP network prior to a router reload we set ISIS overload which is similar to the OSPF command noted above.  We also shut down all eBGP sessions.  We then reboot the router.  After the router comes back and ISIS and MPLS-TE are reestablished we bring eBGP back up.",
