In this configuration you 'redistribute' into OSPF routes x.x.x.x/16 and y.y.y.y/20 with the only exception that during redistribution they become default route.<BR/><BR/>This said, usual restrictions on redistribution apply and iBGP routes are not redistributed into IGP.<BR/>------------------------<BR/><BR/>Perhaps I have a special configuration which triggered the problem, I don't know.",
