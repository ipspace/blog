My impression was the a <EM>section</EM> is something that starts with a non-blank character in the first line, but your tip suggests the IOS actually knows which lines are related. Interesting ... is there any (semi)official explanation on this?<BR/><BR/>BTW, your filter does not include non-subnetted major networks, like<BR/><BR/>O    192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0<BR/>           [110/51] via 172.16.1.2, 00:03:40, Serial0/0/0.100<BR/>           [110/51] via 10.0.0.6, 00:03:40, FastEthernet0/0",
