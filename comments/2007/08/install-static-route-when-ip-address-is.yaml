  html: Hm. The only reason I can come up with for a config like that is if you have
    something like:<BR/><BR/>ip route 1.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 e0/0 172.16.0.22<BR/><BR/>in
    your configuration - and want to send any traffic to 1/8 to the bit bucket if
    the next hop goes down - but the interface stays up.<BR/><BR/>Does this work?
    which metric was used for the "working" route and for the "non-working" route?

  html: If I remember correctly, it was a complex backup scenario where you could
    not simply use the floating static route, but would only install a static route
    if a certain destination is not reachable on the primary path.

  html: Thanks again for a great blog. <BR/><BR/>This is exactly what I need to solve  an
    interesting issue I have (two routers, both using PBR to send traffic into two
    GRE tunnels). This will allow me to use HSRP between the routers and with a little
    more work GLBP.

  html: When you fail-over to your backup route, don't you need to clear your NAT
    translations?

  html: '@Anonymous: I''m assuming you''re refering to the article I''m quoting, not
    to this post, as there is no NAT here.<BR/><BR/>You don''t need to clear the NAT
    translations in my multihoming design, but the sessions are definitely lost when
    the fall-over occurs (and the sessions on the primary link will eventually time
    out).'

  html: to correct routing you must add this route "ip route 1.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 Null0
    track 14" with metric more then 1.

  html: You cannot set a metric of a static route with Cisco IOS, just the administrative
    distance. Whether that should be one (default) or more than one depends on your
    overall design.

  html: A few month back I have using a static route with track to determine when
    the lease line is down at the other end, it will use a backup tunnel. what happen
    was after a few month using the static ip route with track, PING to the remote
    site seems LAN (LAN to LAN) seems to be very slow. It has happen to me 2 times
    already using this design that I have to redesign it again using both connection
    a tunnel. IOS used is 12.4(24)T for the router with static route with track statement.

  html: Even more interesting, How do you track  a static IPv6 route? IP SLA is available
    for IPv6 but  I&#39;m not aware of any IOS feature that lets you install/deinstall
    an IPv6 static route based on a tracked object  -i.e, you just can&#39;t do &quot;
    ipv6 route &lt;ipv6&gt;  &lt;next-hop&gt;  track &lt;tracked&gt;&quot; <br /><br
    />EEM is another possibility here but I can see some scenarios where it wouldn&#39;t
    be as reliable as one would expect. Any other ideas?<br /><br /><br /><br />&lt;/tracked&gt;&lt;/next-hop&gt;&lt;/ipv6&gt;
