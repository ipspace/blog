  html: Hi!<BR/><BR/>That's strange, it didn't work for me in 12.4(11)T, and this
    is the response I got from TAC:<BR/><BR/>------------------------<BR/>the problem
    with originate default information is that it's a special redistribution. In this
    configuration you 'redistribute' into OSPF routes x.x.x.x/16 and y.y.y.y/20 with
    the only exception that during redistribution they become default route.<BR/><BR/>This
    said, usual restrictions on redistribution apply and iBGP routes are not redistributed
    into IGP.<BR/>------------------------<BR/><BR/>Perhaps I have a special configuration
    which triggered the problem, I don't know.

  html: Did you use <B>default-information originate</B> or <B>default-information
    originate always</B>? I would sort-of understand why you'd need to redistribute
    a route into OSPF without the <B>always</B> keyword.

  html: No, I used <B>originate always</B>, because I don't have a default route set
    on the router... Did you have a (static) default route in your configuration somewhere?

  html: No default route. I might still have the original (complete) router configurations.

  html: 'It works for me. I already thought of doing this, then the site confirmed.
    I do not use the ''always'' keywork. I learn the default from BGP, then in my
    route-map match a prefix-list of 0.0.0.0/0 and a tag of the AS it should be from.  No
    redistribution in my setup.<BR/>FYI: matching on next-hop didn''t work.. using
    tags is cleaner anyway.'

  html: Another Caveat is the route-map reference should always match a classful network.<BR/><BR/>EIGRP's
    default-information originate would add a Classful static entry into to the config
    but OSPF does not.<BR/><BR/>Sharath

  html: It was a little bit challenging to notice that a route-map, used by default-information-originate,
    will never match an iBGP route!  ;)

  html: Thanks for the tip! It does make sense (IBGP route is supposed to be coming
    from across the OSPF domain), but it&#39;s definitely a bit under-documented.

    html: You probably need to create a fake route that is tracking an absence of
      a route, and advertise the default route based on the presence of that fake
      route. Something along the lines of<br /><br />http://blog.ipspace.net/2007/08/install-static-route-when-ip-address-is.html

    html: Thanks for your reply. I do admire your work.<br />I tested it by means
      of IP SLA and Boolean Not and it worked, as you pointed out, a bit obscure though.
      I am going to test what you suggested.
