      "html": "BFD is a good enabler for OAM starved protocols (Ethernet), but buys you slightly less for a SONET/SDH transport based IP network.  Consider an ultra long haul link and how quickly a SONET component can signal interface down and hence propagate that to the IGP.  I say only slightly less, because BFD helps a tad against soft failures.  Most people don't monitor their interface counters as religiously as they should. BFD helps safeguard slightly against this.  Now, if you take a large scale network where link aggregation is necessary and BFD breaks down instantly because it hashes to one link.  Moral is, BFD is helpful but no pancea.",
