  html: you missed to mention that not only shouldn't you trust "independent experts"
    neither schouldn't you trust "journalists" in general and especially not technology
    "journalists".<BR/><BR/>by the way the nss press release which the networkworldstory
    refers to is from Nov. 2007!?<BR/><BR/>"Using IPS in your router can turn a 60G
    router into a 5G one or even a 100M bit/sec device" - the only cisco routers i
    know about which support IOS-IPS are 800 to 73xx, none of them is not even near
    "2G". all other cisco IPS solutions are either appliance or module based. And
    if you put a 500Mbps labeled IPS module in your 60G router, not a good idea anyway.<BR/><BR/>And
    by the way if you start to use gravity in your routers then all routers  turn
    into a "1G".

  html: You refer "[configuring] the network in a way that effectively disables the
    hardware." What are some non-obvious examples of this besides the one you named?
    as I didn't know that multiple GRE tunnels terminating at one loopback was bad
    design.

  html: '@Anonymous: terminating multiple GRE tunnels on one loopback interface causes
    problems if the ASICs cannot do a lookup on the source IP address, which is the
    case with some hardware.<BR/><BR/>To figure out the exact limitations of your
    particular combination of hardware+software, it''s best to talk to your Cisco
    SE or (if you''re an end user) your Professional Services partner.<BR/><BR/>@Michael:
    You forgot to mention that you can temporarily turn 1G gravity routers into 10G
    boxes if you drop them.'

    which model of cisco router got the problem about ASICs?<BR/><BR/>Thank you very
    much!

  html: The 7600 in particular will warn you if you attempt to terminate multiple
    tunnels on a single loopback or interface.<BR/><BR/>It provides a warning message
    about traffic will now be software switched.

  html: '@anonymous: Very simple - the first bottleneck is the bus bandwidth between
    FWSM and the backplane. I''ve probably got the figures from the FWSM book published
    by Cisco Press (I was reading it at approximately that time).'

  html: Thanks.  Are you referring to the 6-Gbps dot1q EtherChannel connection to
    the backplane?  If so I am wondering how this is a bottleneck when the specs for
    code &lt;3.2 all state 5Gbps max throughput.  Starting with 4.0 code you can send
    some flows up to the SUP for a max throughput of 20Gbps.

  html: The FWSM-6500/7600 EtherChannel interconnect has an obvious limitation because
    a single IP flow will be glued to one EC 1Gbps member due to src-dst XOR balancing,
    maxing out your VPN tunnel at 1 Gbps each. <BR/><BR/>The 4.0 code can indeed alleviate
    that problem by pushing forwarding to the PFC, but you should only do this for
    stateless flows (UDP, ESP,...), as you lose all stateful checks after doing so.

  html: The loopback / single source restriction for hardware acceleration is a restriction
    of the supervisor.  If using the ipsec spa it works perfectly fine.  Originally
    the documentation had you create a dummy tunnel against the loopback first in
    order to ensure that the rest of the tunnels would get passed on to the spa.<br
    /><br />That restriction is also annoying.  When setting up a head-end for N remote
    sites who is going to create N different loopbacks, each with a unique address,
    simply to create the tunnel?  It's not something that is expected and goes against
    how it would normally be deployed.  A single tunnel to manage the device, fine,
    but not if it's going to be some sort of tunnel aggregator.  And that restriction
    is very, very poorly documented.
