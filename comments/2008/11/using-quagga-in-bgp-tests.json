I've actually consider it as a drawback rather then feature.<BR/>Never thought about it as a possibility to use this feature/weakness for such testing :-)<BR/>Thanks for tip.",

In both cases, the local AS is always prepended to the AS-path as the update is sent to the neighbor, see also:<br />http://blog.ioshints.info/2009/03/as-path-prepending-technical-details.html",
