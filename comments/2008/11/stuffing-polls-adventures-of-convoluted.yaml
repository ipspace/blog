  html: '@Xavier: I think this guy actually clicks the poll. Captcha cannot help you
    if someone is willing to spend time deciphering tens of challenges.<BR/><BR/>@yeled:
    You''re probably right. But even the tape operators I''ve known 25 years ago preferred
    playing DND ;)'

  html: then I would just write a script that removes all votes from IPs that voted
    2 times or more...

  html: '... which is what I did. First manually, then I''ve simply blocked repeat
    votes from the same IP address. But this unfortunately hurts people who sit behind
    a NAT device.'

  html: Maybe you can use a polling service / script which does only allow on poll
    per IP address or one poll per IP per hour...<BR/>Another (dirty) option would
    be to simply block the IP addresses using .htaccess...

  html: '@Anonymous: Absolutely right ... but I really hate reinventing so many wheels
    ;) I would rather write about MPLS VPN or Cisco IOS than hack together a somewhat-secure
    polling service just because someone has nothing better to do than annoy other
    people.'

  html: How do you know it's a he?  Not that I'm saying it's not a he - but it could
    be a she.  You never know...<BR/><BR/>That said, it's pretty sad how some people
    choose to spend their time.

  html: Haha, seriously? Someone actually spent time manually evening out the votes?
    Maybe he has OCD.

  html: I'm sorry to say this but I also had a lot of breaking attempts, spam, and
    all the range of other "great" things coming from *.tpnet.pl...it seems that their
    entire network is used only for this kind of things.<BR/>What I really don't understand
    how come some people have time to spend on this type of activities.

  html: '@Stretch: right now, the "december sessions" poll has a clear leader (@40%)
    but all other options have an equal number of votes ... although I only allow
    one vote per IP address. Obviously our polish friend discovered open proxies around
    the Internet. Definitely OCD, I would say :))'

  html: Evening out votes ?  That is really evil idea :) <BR/><BR/>I feel bad about
    it however, mainly because i am polish too, so don't want people to think that
    we are bunch of tards that have nothing better to do :|<BR/><BR/>However, there
    is something you may consider. You just gave him exactly what he wanted... Attention.
    He is probably laughing hysterically reading this post :)))
