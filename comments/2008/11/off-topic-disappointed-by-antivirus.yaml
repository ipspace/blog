  html: Anti-Virus is a joke these days.  I feel your pain.  I wouldn't recommend
    going all MS because they are responsible for many of the loopholes that allow
    malware in.  However, most AV is very ineffective.  I think an appr0ach more along
    the lines of Cisco CSA is going to have to be adopted by av vendors.  As far as
    AV goes, it seems that a lot of people are recommending Nod32 from Eset.

  html: 'My advice is to surf the world wild web in a browser which runs in a Linux
    virtual machine (for paranoiacs: from read-only LiveCD iso). This approach is
    very effective and requires minimum migration effort because all the existing
    MS-PC infrastructure remains untouched, only a program like VirtualBox is added.
    On the modern computers you usually won''t feel serious performance degradation.'

  html: The best thing you can do is run as a standard user. Then escalate your privleges
    only when you need to, this can be done in the same session without logging out.
    Microsoft has been recomending this for years yet, users continue to run as administrator.
    Thus why Vista has UAC, it is a virtual buffer for an administrator user, the
    UAC is a confirmation that you would like to elevate your priviliges. As a standard
    user you would not get any UAC prompts only password login prompts to esalate
    your privliges. I have found that Microsoft Forefront with Windows Defender, and
    most importantly users running as standard user, and not administators has helped
    elimite 99.8% of our malware, virus support calls.

  html: Sure migrate to Ubuntu, Fedora, or whatever you enjoy working with if you
    don't have to run software built only for Microsoft platforms.

  html: The experince of your kids was the same as a highly qualified IT professional
    that I know.<BR/>What has saved my bacon, because I also have click happy kids
    is OpenDNS.  Better than any AV product.  Would vote it five pineapples.....

  html: '@everyone: Thank you for your comments. It''s nice to see I am not the only
    one disappointed by AV vendors and you gave me a few very interesting hints. <BR/>
    <BR/>@justin: This is exactly what I would enforce in the enterprise network.
    However, I decided to retreat from the constant complaints from the kids (maybe
    it was not a good idea :).<BR/><BR/>@Red pineapple: I was using OpenDNS on my
    Fedora Linux (I had problems with IOS resolving AAAA records), but it was not
    very reliable (at least from my location), so I was forced to go back to the ISP''s
    DNS. And BTW, I almost fell for a very similar trick myself (only my inherent
    laziness prevented me from installing "Adobe Flash Player Version 9" :).'

  html: I agree with what PacketU said above. I have had great success with NOD32
    from ESET. I also believe that the answer lies with something similar to Cisco's
    CSA for the home user. I am surprised that no vendor has stepped up to offer a
    solution like this.
