      "html": "One more thing about object groups: they are saved in the config file in alphabetical order. This creates some problems when you use nested object groups. Let me explain:<BR/><BR/>first, you create an object group called BBB<BR/><BR/>object-group network BBB<BR/> host 1.2.3.4<BR/><BR/>then you create another object group called AAA, that contains reference to BBB<BR/><BR/>object-group network AAA<BR/> group-object BBB<BR/><BR/>This works OKAY, however after you save the configuration, you will notice that AAA object group apears first in the configuration file, like this:<BR/><BR/>object-group network AAA<BR/> group-object BBB<BR/><BR/>object-group network BBB<BR/> host 1.2.3.4<BR/><BR/><BR/>This is wrong, because during router reboot, the object AAA will be defined before object BBB, thus you will have some errors on the console, and your config will not work as expected...",
