      "html": "Ivan,<BR/><BR/>\"Unfortunately, IOS performs a DNS lookup when you enter the hostname...\"<BR/><BR/>I'm not sure why you prefaced that statement with \"unfortunately\".  Surely you don't want IOS to put the hostname in the ACL and do a reverse DNS lookup on every packet entering/exiting your interface to see if it matches, right?<BR/><BR/>The behavior is the same as any, I think, any other device I've used in a similar fashion.  Why the \"unfortunately\"?  Maybe I am missing something?",

      "html": "I also see it as \"unfortunately\". And I wish there would be a solution like the \"set peer ... dynamic\"-config of a crypto-map to resolve the name the moment it is used. For sure, the lookup shouldn't be done on every packet. But it could be done in a fashin like a host uses a \"Lifetime\" to resolve the address and cache it then.",

      "html": "Hi there!<BR/><BR/>The \"trick\" is nice, and it's working in your case now. But what if the server is using some round-robin technology? Your router will put into ACL the first IP which is resolved, but maybe second time another IP will be delivered and since this is not matched, the packets will be discarded. Am I right?<BR/>Overall nice blog and very interesting posts. I will comment some of them if I may :)<BR/>Good luck!",
