  html: This is great. Its nice to see useful things from the PIX world making their

  html: object groups are nice, however they do not work if you use the object group
    acl with "line vty access-class in", or with -self- zone based firewalls.<BR/><BR/>IOS

  html: 'One more thing about object groups: they are saved in the config file in
    alphabetical order. This creates some problems when you use nested object groups.
    Let me explain:<BR/><BR/>first, you create an object group called BBB<BR/><BR/>object-group
    network BBB<BR/> host 1.2.3.4<BR/><BR/>then you create another object group called
    AAA, that contains reference to BBB<BR/><BR/>object-group network AAA<BR/> group-object
    BBB<BR/><BR/>This works OKAY, however after you save the configuration, you will
    notice that AAA object group apears first in the configuration file, like this:<BR/><BR/>object-group
    network AAA<BR/> group-object BBB<BR/><BR/>object-group network BBB<BR/> host
    1.2.3.4<BR/><BR/><BR/>This is wrong, because during router reboot, the object
    AAA will be defined before object BBB, thus you will have some errors on the console,
    and your config will not work as expected...'

  html: Then maybe you want to prefix the object-group name with a number, like 1_bbb,
    2_aaa.
