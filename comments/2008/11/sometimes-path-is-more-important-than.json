I would draw the line between CCNA and CCxP, not between CCxP and CCIE. CCNP and CCIP cover some pretty advanced topics (BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, MPLS ...), where knowledge becomes beneficial ;)",

I am saying that BGP can be basic, medium and advanced. <BR/><BR/>And lest I forget :-)// You promote best practices while I promote worst ;-) <BR/><BR/><BR/>cheers<BR/>Bad Designer",

Experience is the greatest teacher and no one gives you chance to get experience without the letters.<BR/><BR/>Slight off topic note: Why does it feel like Cisco asks you questions on exams in the most vague way possible. :) :)",

I&#39;m not sure how marketable a CCIE is, but my CCxP&#39;s and experience tend to get me most if not all CCIE interviews in my state when I&#39;m in the market.  <br /><br />To me the CCIE has pursuit has been largely a cash drain.  But some people study for free. My fault for taking the scenic route I suppose.  No other way for me.",

Still get invited to interviews, consulting engagements, and other misc. stuff so it&#39;s not all bad not being a CCIE yet.",
