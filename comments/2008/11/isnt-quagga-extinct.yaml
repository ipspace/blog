  html: No, the Quagga is not extinct and was never a seperate subspecies.  Recheck
    the reference.

  html: Well, I can only rely on external sources (you have the privilege of being
    closer to reality :) and Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quagga) as well
    as the source it cites (http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/speciesinfo/quagga.htm)
    claim that quagga was a separate subspecies and that it's now extinct. How could
    I know any better :) I would appreciate any further information you could give
    me.

  html: Ivan,<BR/>which CRS model you have as spare?<BR/>Isn't it the one for which
    Cisco was forced to rebuild their connection to the power company to play with
    it at development stage? :)

  html: '@(empty): It''s no big deal, we have racks with hundreds of routers for remote
    labs, so we''re already a "big customer" for local power company. One CRS more
    or less doesn''t make a big change, it only uses a few kW :)'

  html: My forefather's did their bit in eating too much meat, and we have a genetic
    cholestrol problem as a result.  :-)  But we didn'y kill off the Quaggas!<BR/>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burchell's_Zebra<BR/>"However
    Groves and Bell concluded in their 2004 publication that "the extinct true Burchell's
    zebra" is a phantom. Careful study of the original zebra populations in Zululand
    and Swaziland, and of skins harvested on game farms in Zululand and Natal, has
    revealed that a small certain proportion shows similarity to what now is regarded
    as typical "burchellii". The type localities of the subspecies Equus quagga burchellii
    and Equus quagga antiquorum (Damara Zebra) are so close to each other that the
    two are in fact one, and that therefore the older of the two names should take
    precedence over the younger. They therefore say that the correct name for the
    southernmost subspecies must be burchellii not antiquorum. The subspecies Equus
    quagga burchellii still exists in Kwazulu-Natal and in Etosha."

  html: The same source you&#39;re quoting (Groves &amp; Bell, 2004) lists Quagga
    (E. quagga quagga) as extinct subspecies of Zebra (E. quagga sp.). Burchell&#39;s
    zebra (E. quagga burchelli) is a different subspecies. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plains_Zebra#Taxonomy<BR/><BR/>And,
    BTW, the future readers of this page will be delighted by the relevance of (non)extinct
    Zebra subspecies to BGP next hops :)Although I have to admit I always enjoy having
    a good rare steak and a glass of red wine with the BGP conversations :))

  html: '@Joe: I did and was way more satisfied with what Quagga had to offer me,
    starting with documentation. <BR/><BR/>However, the most important aspects that
    persuaded me to choose Quagga were the very familiar environment (very IOS-like
    configuration and the interactive show commands) and the total disconnect from
    the kernel IP routing table (which is a benefit for the test lab environment).'
