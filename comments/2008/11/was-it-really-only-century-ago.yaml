  html: My first computer was a Timex Sinclair ZX-81 with a 16K external RAM module
    and a Sony tape recorder for high quality computer program feed to the ZX-81 from
    a cassette tape. The membrane keyboard was difficult to type and use; and the
    external ram module was a joke because it always came loose and thus locking the
    computer up many times. Did I mentioned that you need a TV to see the output from
    the ZX-81? That was 1982 and it's amazing how far PC has evolved in 25 yrs.
