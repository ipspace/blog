  html: Ivan,<BR/><BR/>"Unfortunately, IOS performs a DNS lookup when you enter the
    hostname..."<BR/><BR/>I'm not sure why you prefaced that statement with "unfortunately".  Surely
    you don't want IOS to put the hostname in the ACL and do a reverse DNS lookup
    on every packet entering/exiting your interface to see if it matches, right?<BR/><BR/>The
    behavior is the same as any, I think, any other device I've used in a similar
    fashion.  Why the "unfortunately"?  Maybe I am missing something?

  html: I also see it as "unfortunately". And I wish there would be a solution like
    the "set peer ... dynamic"-config of a crypto-map to resolve the name the moment
    it is used. For sure, the lookup shouldn't be done on every packet. But it could
    be done in a fashin like a host uses a "Lifetime" to resolve the address and cache
    it then.

  html: Hi there!<BR/><BR/>The "trick" is nice, and it's working in your case now.
    But what if the server is using some round-robin technology? Your router will
    put into ACL the first IP which is resolved, but maybe second time another IP
    will be delivered and since this is not matched, the packets will be discarded.
    Am I right?<BR/>Overall nice blog and very interesting posts. I will comment some
    of them if I may :)<BR/>Good luck!

  html: I have used this in past with known DNS records (to avoid the round robin
    problems) by editing the config off-line and loading it direct into the startup
    config. I know it's far from ideal, but for small sites where a reboot can happen
    occasionally I've found it useful.

  html: Maybe we can do DNS lookups in TCL and work around the issue with EEM ?
