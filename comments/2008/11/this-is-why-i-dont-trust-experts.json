And if you put a 500Mbps labeled IPS module in your 60G router, not a good idea anyway.<BR/><BR/>And by the way if you start to use gravity in your routers then all routers  turn into a \"1G\".",

Originally the documentation had you create a dummy tunnel against the loopback first in order to ensure that the rest of the tunnels would get passed on to the spa.<br /><br />That restriction is also annoying.  When setting up a head-end for N remote sites who is going to create N different loopbacks, each with a unique address, simply to create the tunnel?  It's not something that is expected and goes against how it would normally be deployed.  A single tunnel to manage the device, fine, but not if it's going to be some sort of tunnel aggregator.  And that restriction is very, very poorly documented.",
