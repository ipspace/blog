      "html": "Anti-Virus is a joke these days.  I feel your pain.  I wouldn't recommend going all MS because they are responsible for many of the loopholes that allow malware in.  However, most AV is very ineffective.  I think an appr0ach more along the lines of Cisco CSA is going to have to be adopted by av vendors.  As far as AV goes, it seems that a lot of people are recommending Nod32 from Eset.",

This approach is very effective and requires minimum migration effort because all the existing MS-PC infrastructure remains untouched, only a program like VirtualBox is added. On the modern computers you usually won't feel serious performance degradation.",

      "html": "The best thing you can do is run as a standard user. Then escalate your privleges only when you need to, this can be done in the same session without logging out. Microsoft has been recomending this for years yet, users continue to run as administrator. Thus why Vista has UAC, it is a virtual buffer for an administrator user, the UAC is a confirmation that you would like to elevate your priviliges. As a standard user you would not get any UAC prompts only password login prompts to esalate your privliges. I have found that Microsoft Forefront with Windows Defender, and most importantly users running as standard user, and not administators has helped elimite 99.8% of our malware, virus support calls.",

It's nice to see I am not the only one disappointed by AV vendors and you gave me a few very interesting hints. <BR/> <BR/>@justin: This is exactly what I would enforce in the enterprise network. However, I decided to retreat from the constant complaints from the kids (maybe it was not a good idea :).<BR/><BR/>@Red pineapple: I was using OpenDNS on my Fedora Linux (I had problems with IOS resolving AAAA records), but it was not very reliable (at least from my location), so I was forced to go back to the ISP's DNS. And BTW, I almost fell for a very similar trick myself (only my inherent laziness prevented me from installing \"Adobe Flash Player Version 9\" :).",
