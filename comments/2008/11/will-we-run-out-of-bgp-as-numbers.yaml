  html: Backward-compatibility is ok for routers but the ecosystem should upgrade
    to. I particularly think about monitoring and management tools. As a security
    fanatic I also lost my thought to integer overflow exploitation in the worst case.

  html: '@Francois: You''re absolutely correct. All provisioning and network management
    tools have to be checked ... not to mention AS-based Netflow :)<BR/><BR/>@Wolruf:
    IOS-XR should support 4-byte AS (I didn''t want to power up the box to check it).'

  html: Call me an ignorant, but how many devices are supporting IOS XR? From what
    I know very few...<BR/>The problem with 4 byte AS is the same like IPv6. If harder
    to change the mentality of the users than to implement it. <BR/>The solution is
    out there, but as long as IPv4 will be tricked to be enough and the current scheme
    of AS numbering, no one will try to implement the new ones.

  html: '@Calin: only the high-end devices (CRS, GSR) run IOS XR.<BR/><BR/>The problem
    with 4-byte AS is probably worse (but less noticed) than the IPv6; while we can
    cheat around a while with NAT (and thus try to avoid IPv6), it''s pretty hard
    to be truly multihomed without a public AS number. <BR/><BR/>Fortunately, 4-byte
    AS numbers are seamlessly compatible with the 2-byte AS numbers.'
