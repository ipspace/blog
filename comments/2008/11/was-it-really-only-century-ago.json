      "html": "My first computer was a Timex Sinclair ZX-81 with a 16K external RAM module and a Sony tape recorder for high quality computer program feed to the ZX-81 from a cassette tape. The membrane keyboard was difficult to type and use; and the external ram module was a joke because it always came loose and thus locking the computer up many times. Did I mentioned that you need a TV to see the output from the ZX-81? That was 1982 and it's amazing how far PC has evolved in 25 yrs.",
