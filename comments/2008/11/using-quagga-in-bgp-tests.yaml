  html: Also useful thing to generate BGP-routes is NET::BGP module in perl. I use
    this module to upload multiple Internet full view tables to router in lab for
    testing purposes.

  html: Hi I'm using quagga in production evironment (non-business though) and feature
    that network command is creating a bgp route even if router hasn't same prefix
    in routing table was very annoying to me. I've actually consider it as a drawback
    rather then feature.<BR/>Never thought about it as a possibility to use this feature/weakness
    for such testing :-)<BR/>Thanks for tip.

  html: Why not use Vyatta?<BR/><BR/>It includes Quagga and has a command line structure
    more like IOS and JunOS.  Plus lots of documentation.

  html: Sadly Quagga lacks MPBGP capability, though it does have it coded in it isn't
    stable enough to be usable.

  html: Oh, I would never use Quagga in a production environment (and I guess there
    are numerous people that disagree with me :), but it's perfect in a test lab.

  html: Hi Ivan, by reading at the CT3 wiki doc (http://wiki.nil.com/Use_Quagga_to_generate_BGP_routes),
    I saw that &quot;set as-path prepend 1 2 3 4&quot; is there, and I believe the
    AS_PATH should looks like 1 2 3 4 65000, but seems like it get appended instead
    of prepended based on the output of the &quot;show ip bgp&quot; command on the
    Cisco router in the last code snippet in the mentioned document. 8-)

  html: "In my example the AS-path is \u201Cprepended\u201D to an empty AS-path when\
    \ the route is inserted into the BGP table. You can use the \u201Cset as-path\
    \ prepend\u201D to prepend AS-path when sending it to a neighbor or to set AS-path\
    \ when inserting the route in the BGP table. In both cases, the local AS is always\
    \ prepended to the AS-path as the update is sent to the neighbor, see also:<br\
