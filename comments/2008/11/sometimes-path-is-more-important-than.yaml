  html: I was really shocked whan I had a discussion with a CCIE security and he don&#39;t
    even known what is Bob &amp; Alice...<BR/>From this time my point of view of certified
    people is that they are just good copycat and Cisco world learner by heart but
    with poor background and skills.

  html: Francois,<BR/>I really don&#39;t think that Alice &amp; Bob are measure of
    knowledge, but I agree with the rest. CCIE is easy to &quot;brute force&quot;
    nowadays and that certificate definitely lost his prestige,challenge and authority.

  html: Ivan I keep saying the only way that changes is when people and recruiters
    stop being slaves to the certification grindmill.<BR/><BR/>If people hope to get
    hired now, they need some sort of letters behind their name.

  html: hi agree with Roger.<BR/><BR/>now everyone will have the luxury to take the
    scenic route.. passing the exam will generally give you a quicker route into the
    job where you can gain experience (and subsequently knowledge)..<BR/><BR/>in reality
    at the lower level of certs.. knowledge is limited anyway.. its only at CCIE+
    that knowledge comes into its own with or without the cert and that means several
    yrs of experience and learning down the scenic route.<BR/><BR/>promoting worst
    practices as ever<BR/>bad designer :-)

  html: '@Roger: You wouldn''t believe what my next "Fragments" post is about :))<BR/><BR/>The
    point I wanted to make was "if you have to go through the motions, make sure you
    gain something from the process".<BR/><BR/>And last but not least, (as always)
    I have to disagree with the bad designer. I would draw the line between CCNA and
    CCxP, not between CCxP and CCIE. CCNP and CCIP cover some pretty advanced topics
    (BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, MPLS ...), where knowledge becomes beneficial ;)'

  html: im sorry you disagree with me BUT..<BR/><BR/>1) The fact is that even CCIE
    level BGP is not enough to design an Internet policy<BR/><BR/>2) QOS learned for
    CCxP and CCIE is not enough to be able to build a multiservice backbone with tight
    SLAs.<BR/><BR/>3) Where is inter-as MPLS and MPLS TE (and reasons for tactical
    vs strategic) in the certifications?<BR/><BR/>I would suggest you redefine your
    definition of advanced because upto CCIE level OSPF/ISIS et al are to intermediate
    level and moreover, pretty much implementation.<BR/><BR/>What I am trying to say
    is that in my own experience I really started to learn advanced topics (and therefore
    deep knowledge) after my CCIE, which was once I started getting the jobs offered
    giving me exposure for this.<BR/><BR/>However, I understand fully why we disagree..
    <BR/><BR/>You are saying that BGP is an advanced topic perse. I am saying that
    BGP can be basic, medium and advanced. <BR/><BR/>And lest I forget :-)// You promote
    best practices while I promote worst ;-) <BR/><BR/><BR/>cheers<BR/>Bad Designer

  html: 'On Bad Designer''s point<BR/><BR/>I am of the opinion that I will never truly
    understand some things until I really do them.<BR/><BR/>Like building a fully
    functionally, well architected spanning tree topology or something to that effect.<BR/><BR/>Fact
    is I dont have a whole bunch of switches lying around to do that. Experience is
    the greatest teacher and no one gives you chance to get experience without the
    letters.<BR/><BR/>Slight off topic note: Why does it feel like Cisco asks you
    questions on exams in the most vague way possible. :) :)'

  html: I tend to agree with Ivan.  I&#39;ve definately taken the scenic route towards
    a CCIE and I&#39;ve got the CCxP&#39;s certifications with the experience for
    each.  I&#39;m not sure how marketable a CCIE is, but my CCxP&#39;s and experience
    tend to get me most if not all CCIE interviews in my state when I&#39;m in the
    market.  <br /><br />To me the CCIE has pursuit has been largely a cash drain.  But
    some people study for free. My fault for taking the scenic route I suppose.  No
    other way for me.

  html: My comments still hold true... who knows maybe more so now that I&#39;m fully
    immersed in the Data Center and even more so than that with the advent of being
    very well read, experienced (trial/error/hands-on/training/internal issues/etc.)
    with the Nexus series, ASRs, and other devices like WAAS for example, not to mention
    a nice breadth and depth with WLAN and SAN in general.  <br /><br />No time for
    the CCIE per se at the moment due to all of the above, but the scenic route sure
    has a lot of pretty scenery and I for one am taking the time to smell the roses.  Still
    get invited to interviews, consulting engagements, and other misc. stuff so it&#39;s
    not all bad not being a CCIE yet.
