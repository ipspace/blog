  html: 1 reason why you should never use dns hostnames in a firewall policy.<BR/><BR/>This
    gives attackers control over your policies. DNS is insecure. Attackers can manipulate
    DNS in a number of ways. If this summer's DNS snafu didn't teach us that, I don't
    know what will.

  html: '@Anonymous: while I completely agree with you, I would still like to have
    an option to choose ... or have no option to enter a host name at all.<BR/><BR/>In
    low-security environments, the capability to adapt to changes in external networks
    (which is what DNS is all about) might be more important than the perfect filtering.
    You might want to read the posts I''ve linked to (for example, <A HREF="http://blog.ioshints.info/2008/11/acl-object-groups.html"
    REL="nofollow">this one</A>) to understand the whole context.<BR/><BR/>And just
    in case someone would try to mis-understand me: I would never use a dynamic DNS-resolved
    IP address in a reasonably secure firewall.'
