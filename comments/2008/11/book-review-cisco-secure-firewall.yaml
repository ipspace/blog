  html: Have you read the 'Cisco ASA, PIX and FWSM Firewall handbook'? I've read that
    one but was hoping for more information on the FWSM, specifically in transparent
    mode. Maybe this new book is the one I'm looking for.

  html: The one I've read has plenty of information on the transparent mode (including
    deployment and design scenarios). If that's what you're looking for, try it.
