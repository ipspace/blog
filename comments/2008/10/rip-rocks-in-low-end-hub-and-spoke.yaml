  html: I'd much rather use EIGRP stub

  html: EIGRP stub feature does *NOT* prevent hub router from advertising all information
    to spokes -- you have to use distribute-list or summarization up to 0/0. I'd choose
    OSPF w/ "ip ospf database-filter all out" to reduce flooding in hub-n-spoke environment.

  html: '@Michael: you might not have EIGRP on remote (low-end, low-cost) routers.<BR/><BR/>@Uri:
    RIP has exactly the same configuration overhead as EIGRP; you have to configure
    summary or default route advertisement.'

  html: Sure.. It does have the same overhead. Btw, living in the all-cisco world
    may be we should start "ODR vs proto-X" flame?<BR/><BR/>http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_white_paper09186a0080093fde.shtml<BR/><BR/>:)

  html: In a very large (hundreds of spokes) dual-homed remote RIP environment, what's
    the convergence time for a primary hub failure? I poked around looking for information
    on this, but didn't find anything.

  html: '@uri: Don''t worry, I could start the ODR religious war ... I just need to
    figure out a good provocative intro.<BR/><BR/>@js: regardless of the number of
    spoke routers, the convergence time always depends on RIP timers. <BR/><BR/>You
    might have interesting problems sending a huge number of RIP updates from the
    hub router, though.'

  html: I find eigrp stub is an elegant solution in a large hub and spoke network.
    <BR/><BR/>Used with a single default distribution filter from the hub makes for
    a very small config and also allows the ability to leak certain routes beyond
    a default if desired to all spokes.<BR/><BR/>ODR is also a low overhead, small
    config, but does not allow the ability to leak routes to the stubs (some would
    also argue ODR is not a routing protocol as it leverages CDP). It is also proprietary.<BR/><BR/>For
    example, I blackhole host routes at the ingress by advertising them to the spokes
    in concert with uRPF.<BR/><BR/>I'm not certain that ospf could perform as well
    in a large hub/spoke along with those capabilities.<BR/><BR/>So I also think that
    RIPv2 could be a better fit in a large hub and spoke, providing a small and flexible
    config. (and then redistributing from the hub in/out of the core IGP)<BR/>Compared
    to EIGRP, the downside is the convergence time and periodic flooding. The upside
    is it is an open protocol.
