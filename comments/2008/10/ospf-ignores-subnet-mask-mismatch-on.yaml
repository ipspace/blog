  html: Of course, if you're really interested in punishing yourself with exotic OSPF
    behavior, setting the OSPF network type to point-to-point will allow you to form
    mismatched adjacencies across multiaccess interfaces.

    be to mix numbered/unnumbered ifaces but.. *UNFORTUNATELY* it''s prohibited. :)'

  html: Hi Ivan, I&#39;ve got this situation, we have E1 with pvdm2-36dm to terminate
    branch dial connection. This pvdm works as async interfaces... while we have over
    than 50 branches we only have 31 lines available on E1, thus the point to point
    addressing will be assigned by dialing branch. Up to this point it&#39;s okay
    but the mask is /32, while HQ needs to understand branch&#39; lan segment through
    routing protocol. The adjacency just won&#39;t come up due to the mismatched mask.
    Please help... what can I do in this situation.

  html: It might be easiest to use unnumbered dialup interfaces.

  html: hello Ivan, <br /><br />I have some inconsistent behavior with ospf adjacencies
    which are established over links with mismatches masks. I have issues with ospf
    installing routes which are learned over an adjacency as described above, any
    ideas?<br /><br />thanks<br />max

  html: 'Watch out for the JunOS interpretation of the standard. <br /><br />http://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&amp;id=KB23533<br
    /><br />Section 1.2 of RFC 2328 defines point-to-points as.... &quot;Point-to-point
    networks:  A network that joins a single pair of routers.  A 56Kb serial line
    is an example of a point-to-point network.&quot;<br /><br />However Juniper seems
    to enforce mask checks for &#39;ethernet&#39; point-to-point network types.   That&#39;s
    a bummer because Quagga likes to set the Mask to 0.0.0.0 on point-to-pont adjacencies.

  html: 'I test this on GNS3 and it&#39;s correct HOWEVER, you will still get a network
