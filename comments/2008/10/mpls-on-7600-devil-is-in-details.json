      "html": "Hi Ivan,<BR/>thanks for this interesting facts, espacially that the 7600's treats internally everything as a VLAN interface. I guess this is because the 7600 series is nearly identic to the Catalyst 6500 series?<BR/>I've asking me several times what the differences between these two series are (except of that they are routers / layer 3 switches)... - Cisco seems not to provides many informations about this, seems like some modules are compatible with both series (Sup2, Sup32, Sup720, SIP-400, ...) and some are not (RSP720). The gerneal question is, what can you do with a 7600 which you can't do with a 6500 and vice versa...<BR/>Maybe you could go a bit deeper into these details in a following article...<BR/><BR/>Regards<BR/>Christoph",
