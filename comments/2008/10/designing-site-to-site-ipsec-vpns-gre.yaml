  html: "Under Listing 1 Bo\u0161tjan \u0160u\u0161tar say: <BR/><BR/>\"If remote\
    \ sites use dynamically assigned IP addresses, you can use a dynamic crypto map\
    \ in the central site and use loopback interfaces with static private addresses\
    \ for GRE peering.\"<BR/><BR/>As far as I know the only tunnel interface which\
    \ works without tunnel destination is GRE multipoint type when combined with NHRP.<BR/><BR/>How\
    \ the hub router know how to communicate with dynamic IP addressed spokes without\
    \ NHRP using only dynamic crypto map?"
