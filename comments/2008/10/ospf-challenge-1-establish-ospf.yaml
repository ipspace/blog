  html: Change both interface OSPF network type from Broadcast to Point-to-Point,
    it will ignore the mask mismatch when established OSPF adjacency.<BR/><BR/>Johnson<BR/>CCIE#11440

  html: I guess I would work without any changes of the configuration (which can't
    do anyway) because R1 has the IP address 192.168.1.17 on Fa0/0 which is included
    in the network 192.168.1.18/30 on interface Fa0/0 of R2.<BR/>I didn't test it
    in a Lab but I guess OSPF does not check if the subnet masks are matching. In
    this case it would work (but it's really dirty...).<BR/><BR/>Regards<BR/>Christoph

  html: I think that CCIE#11440 has already spoiled the fun, so there is nothing wrong
    in writing this post.<BR><BR/>The solution is quite easy if we refer to the previous
    post on <A HREF="http://blog.ioshints.info/2008/10/ospf-ignores-subnet-mask-mismatch-on.html"
    REL="nofollow">OSPF subnet mask ignoring</A>. It paid attention to the possible
    strange results, which might happen on the point-to-point links. But referring
    to RFC states that this behaviour doesn't really rely on the link type, but rather
    on the network type, though in normal cases they are just the same. But in some
    weird situations we are allowed tune this parameter (in fact we are lying to the
    router and it might have not very pleasant consequences). So it is necessary to
    issue the<BR><BR/>ip ospf network point-to-point<BR><BR/>command under each interface
    and the routers will establish OSPF adjacency. After that the routing table looks
    like that:<BR><BR/>     192.168.1.0/24 is variably subnetted, 2 subnets, 2 masks<BR><BR/>O       192.168.1.0/24
    [110/20] via 192.168.1.17, 00:25:14, FastEthernet0/0<BR><BR/>C       192.168.1.16/30
    is directly connected, FastEthernet0/0<BR><BR/>which is quite unnatural for me
    as I am far away from CCIE.<BR><BR/>But after all, if we think about it, such
    thing as network mask is almost nonsense in the point-to-point world. There is
    only this side and that side and the way we get to any of these is obvious after
    we have discovered all the necessary information during IPCP.

  html: OSPF neighborship works on multicast. So during neighborship it will not check
    the subnets.

  html: I tested but it works only on serial interfaces not on fe or broadcast media.

  html: 'RFC 2328 say: <BR/>" The Hello packet also contains the IP address<BR/>  mask
    of the attached network (Network Mask).  On unnumbered<BR/>  point-to-point networks
    and on virtual links this field should be set to 0.0.0.0."<BR/><BR/>But... I have
    try with dynamips/gns3: 2 cisco 36xx 12.4 ios. <BR/><BR/>Using  point-to-point
    command under fastethernet the netmask in the ospf hellos is always present and
    the adjacency came up. <BR/>So i think that there is an algoritm inside ios that
    make the router do not consider the netmask when, in a broadcast network, you
    simulate a point to point link.<BR/>From cisco website: "  When you configure
    the command on the Multiaccess interface (that is, Ethernet) or the loopback interface,
    the following messages are displayed:<BR/><BR/>    RouterA(config)# int e0 <BR/>    RouterA(config-if)#
    ip unnumbered serial 0 <BR/>    Point-to-point (non-multi-access) interfaces only
    <BR/>    RouterA(config-if)# ip unnumbered loopback 0 <BR/>    Point-to-point
    (non-multi-access) interfaces only IP and IP Unnumbered"<BR/><BR/>So...<BR/>I''
    ve tested the serial connections: <BR/>I''ve  set the ip address under the serial.
    The netmask is always present in the ospf hellos, but the adjancency is done.<BR/><BR/>Then
    I have configured the serial interface as unnumbered...finally as rfc say... the
    netmask in the ospf hellos is 0.0.0.0 and the adjacency came up.<BR/><BR/><BR/>Note:
    on gns3 you can sniff the serial interfaces. See gns3 documentation<BR/><BR/><BR/>Thanks<BR/><BR/>Alessandro'

  html: Did you intentionally put the same hostname on both routers or was it just
    a typo? :)<br /><br />I have to admit I had to look for the OSPF packet header
    as I got confused and thought that the hostname might influence OSPF adjacency.<br
    /><br />I remembered later that ppp chap is where hostname is important.
