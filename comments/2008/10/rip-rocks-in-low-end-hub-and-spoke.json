      "html": "I find eigrp stub is an elegant solution in a large hub and spoke network. <BR/><BR/>Used with a single default distribution filter from the hub makes for a very small config and also allows the ability to leak certain routes beyond a default if desired to all spokes.<BR/><BR/>ODR is also a low overhead, small config, but does not allow the ability to leak routes to the stubs (some would also argue ODR is not a routing protocol as it leverages CDP). It is also proprietary.<BR/><BR/>For example, I blackhole host routes at the ingress by advertising them to the spokes in concert with uRPF.<BR/><BR/>I'm not certain that ospf could perform as well in a large hub/spoke along with those capabilities.<BR/><BR/>So I also think that RIPv2 could be a better fit in a large hub and spoke, providing a small and flexible config. (and then redistributing from the hub in/out of the core IGP)<BR/>Compared to EIGRP, the downside is the convergence time and periodic flooding. The upside is it is an open protocol.",
