  html: Modern switches can use "option 82" to pass customer port number and "switch
    id" to DHCP-server. Dynamic ARP inspection and IP source guard can prevent "packet
    injection".

  html: IP over Avian Carriers is classical "long-haul" technology. For shorter distance
    RFC 1926 is better choice.

  html: Well, I'm a bit surprised that you are surprised about this... ;-)<BR/>Here
    in Germany, Deutsche Telekom provides its customers FTTC-based VDSL-lines with
    IP-DSLAM's, so this is quite compareable, and they use PPPoE too.<BR/>Honestly,
    I don't even know if any ISP uses DHCP for access lines here in Germany... (nearly
    99,99% use PPP, PPPoE and / or PPPoA I guess)<BR/>Another argument for this solution
    is that you can easily deploy MPLS-VPN's using the same concept. You just have
    to add a RADIUS-Attribute...

  html: like you say in fragments, much better for security<BR/><BR/>the sad thing
    is, how many people are going to be running these connections on little crappy
    home-use routers whose cpu maxes out at 8-10mbps?

    adapters. :)

  html: '@visir: Thanks. I learn something new every day :)<BR/><BR/>@A#1: Definitely
    a better choice for Metro service. But I guess we need a newer version of the
    standard. If we''d switch to ultrasound (avoiding the range used by bats to decrease
    background noise), we could drastically increase the transmission speed.<BR/><BR/>@A#2:
    I''m not surprised. Now I also know where my SP got this bright idea.<BR/><BR/>@A#3:
    You''re right ... but in the end, the SP always wins. They give you low-cost crappy
    router that cannot saturate the link you''re paying for, so they lower the overall
    utilization.<BR/><BR/>@A#4: I don''t think this is an issue on any decent PC/workstation.<BR/><BR/>And,
    please, would you finally start using nicknames. Trying to sort out replies to
    four anonymous commenters is not fun :D'

  html: By "dedicated high performance PPPoE optimized network adapter" I mean PCI
    Express ten gigabit ethernet card with hardware acceleration for PPPoE able to
    transmit/receive and processing PPPoE frames at the full wirespeed. :)
