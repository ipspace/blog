(nearly 99,99% use PPP, PPPoE and / or PPPoA I guess)<BR/>Another argument for this solution is that you can easily deploy MPLS-VPN's using the same concept. You just have to add a RADIUS-Attribute...",

      "html": "@visir: Thanks. I learn something new every day :)<BR/><BR/>@A#1: Definitely a better choice for Metro service. But I guess we need a newer version of the standard. If we'd switch to ultrasound (avoiding the range used by bats to decrease background noise), we could drastically increase the transmission speed.<BR/><BR/>@A#2: I'm not surprised. Now I also know where my SP got this bright idea.<BR/><BR/>@A#3: You're right ... but in the end, the SP always wins. They give you low-cost crappy router that cannot saturate the link you're paying for, so they lower the overall utilization.<BR/><BR/>@A#4: I don't think this is an issue on any decent PC/workstation.<BR/><BR/>And, please, would you finally start using nicknames. Trying to sort out replies to four anonymous commenters is not fun :D",
