            <div class="comment-content">Back when I was teaching CCNP courses some years ago, I had a student who got really upset when I told him there was no good reason to use the matching inverse-mask method. He simply refused to believe that any other method was acceptable, and questioned my competence for even suggesting anything else. I thought he was a little too much emotional investment in IOS configurations. :-)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I just have a slight quibble with one of your recommendations.  In the second to last configuration, you recommend making sure that your links are in separate IP ranges, and using the network command to match those ranges, but in the last (complex) example, you recommend using the area command on the individual interfaces.  Personally, I have always tried to make sure that I design the network to fit that middle scenario - that way, when I add a new site (and corresponding interface to the HQ/Hub router), the new interface is automatically in the right area.  This discipline also helps keep the network summarizable, to keep the size of the routing tables down.  There may be some exceptions, but I think it's better to treat those as exceptions, than to abandon good design just because the network is 'complex' (especially since almost everyone thinks their network is complex).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">@js: I've also seen students like that :)<BR/><BR/>@Anonymous: You're absolutely correct. I've reworded the "complex scenarios" section. This problem might arise if there's no clear IP addressing design (for example, nobody was willing to pay for it :), if the network has grown "organically" or if the network is being migrated from another routing protocol (for example, from EIGRP) to OSPF.</div>
