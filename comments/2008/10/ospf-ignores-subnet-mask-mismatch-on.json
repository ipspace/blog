This pvdm works as async interfaces... while we have over than 50 branches we only have 31 lines available on E1, thus the point to point addressing will be assigned by dialing branch. Up to this point it&#39;s okay but the mask is /32, while HQ needs to understand branch&#39; lan segment through routing protocol. The adjacency just won&#39;t come up due to the mismatched mask. Please help... what can I do in this situation.",

Let&#39;s in fact remember though that these interface ip addresses are just IDs for the interfaces (that are in fact always considered transit interfaces and thus never source or destination of the traffic) and are NOT routed since it is their equivalent stub link (i.e. network/mask) that is routed instead. <br />\nSo, say for example that router 1 has link id (i.e. numbered interface ip addresse) A and B, and Router 2 has links C and D, then how one can identify by looking at Type-1 LSA, that the connections are (A-C and B-D) or (A-D and B-C) ? <br />\nThis holds though for numbered p2p links ...but what about unnumbered p2p links ? Unnumbered p2p interfaces are not identified by their interfaces ip address but by their MIB ifindex. How can any router in the area work out the plumbing of parallel unnumbered P2P links between any two routers ? <br />\nThis very same doubt was expressed by Jitendra Sharma @ the very end of this blog https://packetpushers.net/ospf-graphs-lsas-and-the-lsdb/     </p>\n\n<p>Ciao <br />\nAndrea      </p>\n",
