      "html": "Hi Ivan, I&#39;ve got this situation, we have E1 with pvdm2-36dm to terminate branch dial connection. This pvdm works as async interfaces... while we have over than 50 branches we only have 31 lines available on E1, thus the point to point addressing will be assigned by dialing branch. Up to this point it&#39;s okay but the mask is /32, while HQ needs to understand branch&#39; lan segment through routing protocol. The adjacency just won&#39;t come up due to the mismatched mask. Please help... what can I do in this situation.",
