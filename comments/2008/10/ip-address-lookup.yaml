  html: It's a fun thing to do, but I wouldn't rely on it for anything serious.  Anybody
    attacking your network is likely:<BR/><BR/>A) Spoofing their address, in which
    case the location information will be wrong; or <BR/><BR/>B) Using a botnet, in
    which case the location you get will be that of the bot, and not the actual attacker.

  html: Also, (at least in Sweden) the location reported will be the location of the
    owner of the IP, which is usually the ISP ;)

  html: '@anonymous: (A) absolutely correct. The source IP address only makes sense
    if the TCP session is successfully established (= the source is obviously not
    spoofed), which usually coincides with a log entry on a server.<BR/><BR/>(B) Most
    of the attacks I see in various server logs don''t come from bots, but from script
    kiddies or someone downloading the whole web site content and overloading the
    server in the process. In both cases the IP address makes sense.<BR/><BR/>@Freelancer:
    Correct. The location reported is whatever the ISP has entered in some database
    as the location for a particular IP address block. In some cases, it''s the ISP''s
    location, in other cases the ISP might have split the address range into regional
    blocks and registered them properly.'

  html: Nevertheless it has a additional  business cause - to  cut off unwanted traffic
    based on the country. securityfocus.com/infocus has a nice article about that.
    I know of one such production<BR/>implementation , where on the perimeter there
    is <BR/>a simple layer 3 packet filter IPtables based FW<BR/>that filters out
    unwanted traffic and thus lowers<BR/>logs clutter/IPS load/management burden.
