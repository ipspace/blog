            <div class="comment-content">I can recommend you "Facebook". It's really nice organized network. I can say many things about it and all they would be positive. So, just try it. I am sure that you would not regret ;-)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Facebook is too invasive for me. It wants to take over your entire Internet experience and too many people let that happen. Thus I stopped. (And please, as if sending a 'snowglobe' makes you interesting....)<BR/><BR/>In turn, this turned me off the whole Social Networking thing. I can't 'get into it' becuase it makes no sense (and maybe becuase it sucks up so much time). After a while I also realised that no one I know uses it either, not work colleagues, not bloggers or readers of me blog. <BR/><BR/>So I stopped at Linked In which I use to keep in touch with Professional people, and doesn't try to invade your life so much. Keep it simple.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I think social networking and how people want to engage is a personal decision.  Just like old school "in-person" networking, people choose how they want to engage.  The same concept should simply be applied to online social networking.  You choose your own boundaries, based on your comfort level and what you want to get out of the engagement. Just how people are different, their engagement within social networks will also differ.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hello, Ivan.<BR/>I'd say it really depends. What is your expectations from social networking? If you want to participate in discussions and find interesting people to connect it might be linkedin. The problem with it - limited functionality comparing to facebook. There is no ability to share some video or photos, as well as create some event and invite people. <BR/>So, as usual right question it's at least half of answer. :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I use LinkedIn for professional and Myspace for friends.  It seems to work pretty well as long as you don't get sucked into all of the extra applications on Myspace.  I have some limited success with making contacts through LinkedIn and I have even received a few job offers.</div>
