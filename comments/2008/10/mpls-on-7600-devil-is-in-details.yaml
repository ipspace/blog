  html: Hi Ivan,<BR/>thanks for this interesting facts, espacially that the 7600's
    treats internally everything as a VLAN interface. I guess this is because the
    7600 series is nearly identic to the Catalyst 6500 series?<BR/>I've asking me
    several times what the differences between these two series are (except of that
    they are routers / layer 3 switches)... - Cisco seems not to provides many informations
    about this, seems like some modules are compatible with both series (Sup2, Sup32,
    Sup720, SIP-400, ...) and some are not (RSP720). The gerneal question is, what
    can you do with a 7600 which you can't do with a 6500 and vice versa...<BR/>Maybe
    you could go a bit deeper into these details in a following article...<BR/><BR/>Regards<BR/>Christoph

  html: Yeah, you need Adv. IP for MPLS. Heck, you even need Adv. IP for IPv6.<BR/><BR/>Both
    ought to be considered standard features in this day and age.

  html: There are many things that are not supported on vlan interfaces. Specifically
    you cannot "xconnect" a vlan interface over mpls. This only works for physical
    interfaces.
