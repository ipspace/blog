  html: 'Ivan,  thanks for the links!!!<BR/>I thought of creating a Pineapple Certified
    Religious Bovine Professional certification.  What do you think?  You can have
    PCRBP #00001.<BR/>To be more democratic about it, I have created polls around
    these myths, based on the Mythbuster''s methodology.  They are called Redibusters:<BR/>http://thinkingproblemmanagement.blogspot.com/search/label/Redibusters'

  html: <B>NAT looks at the packet (and creates the translation) even if the inbound
    ACL drops it.</B><BR/><BR/>I have seen this behaviour as well.<BR/><BR/>I only
    caught it because I was testing something so I had ACL&#39;s going in both directions
    on interior &amp; exterior interfaces.<BR/><BR/>My internal conversation went
    something along the lines of, &quot;WTF, I&#39;m blocking that, it shouldn&#39;t
    even be traversing across the router&quot;<BR/><BR/>Sometimes I wonder

  html: I used to think that certifications were a useful indicator of knowledge or
    at least initiative, but I'm changing my mind. I interviewed a guy last week who
    had a whole pile of Cisco certifications (CCNP, CCSP, CCVP, CCDP, at least). I
    asked him some elementary questions about how packets flow across a network. He
    couldn't describe ARP. He had trouble with the difference between static and connected
    routes. He couldn't describe how a TCP handshake works at all. He couldn't accurately
    describe the the difference between a physical interface being up and a line protocol
    being up.<BR/><BR/>He then claimed to be much better at Cisco voice. So I asked
    him some basic CallManager and IOS voice gateway questions, and he completely
    flunked those. He was "absolutely, 100% certain" that MGCP controls phones, not
    gateways.<BR/><BR/>This was the most egregious example I've seen, but not the
    only one.<BR/><BR/>I feel like I've gotten a lot out of studying for certifications,
    especially CCIE, but I'm starting to wonder if that's the exception.
