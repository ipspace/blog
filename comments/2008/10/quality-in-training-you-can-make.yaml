  html: I agree 100%.  I also think that it is important to provide a feedback mechanism
    to your employer (if they are footing the bill).  I've worked in large enterprises
    and they all have used the same training company for tech training (with a few
    exceptions for direct training from the vendor).  This training company has a
    huge catalog of courses but the quality of their training is inconsistent.  I've
    attended outstanding classes and very poor ones.  They have a feedback mechanism,
    but it only for the training company.  This means that we continue to send engineers
    to those sub par courses regardless of whether or not they "fix" the class.<BR/><BR/>The
    lack of internal feedback also poisons the well for other training vendors.  If
    our "primary training vendor" offers the course then we must use them.  With an
    internal feedback mechanism it could open up the option of using a different vendor
    for classes that don't meet our training needs.
