(And please, as if sending a 'snowglobe' makes you interesting....)<BR/><BR/>In turn, this turned me off the whole Social Networking thing. I can't 'get into it' becuase it makes no sense (and maybe becuase it sucks up so much time). After a while I also realised that no one I know uses it either, not work colleagues, not bloggers or readers of me blog. <BR/><BR/>So I stopped at Linked In which I use to keep in touch with Professional people, and doesn't try to invade your life so much. Keep it simple.",

      "html": "I think social networking and how people want to engage is a personal decision.  Just like old school \"in-person\" networking, people choose how they want to engage.  The same concept should simply be applied to online social networking.  You choose your own boundaries, based on your comfort level and what you want to get out of the engagement. Just how people are different, their engagement within social networks will also differ.",

If you want to participate in discussions and find interesting people to connect it might be linkedin. The problem with it - limited functionality comparing to facebook. There is no ability to share some video or photos, as well as create some event and invite people. <BR/>So, as usual right question it's at least half of answer. :)",
