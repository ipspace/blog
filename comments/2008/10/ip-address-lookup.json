Anybody attacking your network is likely:<BR/><BR/>A) Spoofing their address, in which case the location information will be wrong; or <BR/><BR/>B) Using a botnet, in which case the location you get will be that of the bot, and not the actual attacker.",

      "html": "@anonymous: (A) absolutely correct. The source IP address only makes sense if the TCP session is successfully established (= the source is obviously not spoofed), which usually coincides with a log entry on a server.<BR/><BR/>(B) Most of the attacks I see in various server logs don't come from bots, but from script kiddies or someone downloading the whole web site content and overloading the server in the process. In both cases the IP address makes sense.<BR/><BR/>@Freelancer: Correct. The location reported is whatever the ISP has entered in some database as the location for a particular IP address block. In some cases, it's the ISP's location, in other cases the ISP might have split the address range into regional blocks and registered them properly.",
