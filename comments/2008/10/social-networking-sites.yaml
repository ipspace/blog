  html: I can recommend you "Facebook". It's really nice organized network. I can
    say many things about it and all they would be positive. So, just try it. I am
    sure that you would not regret ;-)

  html: Facebook is too invasive for me. It wants to take over your entire Internet
    experience and too many people let that happen. Thus I stopped. (And please, as
    if sending a 'snowglobe' makes you interesting....)<BR/><BR/>In turn, this turned
    me off the whole Social Networking thing. I can't 'get into it' becuase it makes
    no sense (and maybe becuase it sucks up so much time). After a while I also realised
    that no one I know uses it either, not work colleagues, not bloggers or readers
    of me blog. <BR/><BR/>So I stopped at Linked In which I use to keep in touch with
    Professional people, and doesn't try to invade your life so much. Keep it simple.

  html: I use Linkedin for work and Facebook for personal.  I have a few datacom-type
    hooks in facebook, but in general I don't think of it as a professional resource.

  html: Linkedin for professional stuff, FB and MySpace for personal though I try
    to keep their usage minimal.

  html: I think social networking and how people want to engage is a personal decision.  Just
    like old school "in-person" networking, people choose how they want to engage.  The
    same concept should simply be applied to online social networking.  You choose
    your own boundaries, based on your comfort level and what you want to get out
    of the engagement. Just how people are different, their engagement within social
    networks will also differ.

  html: i use myspace for friends i see out drinking, and facebook for family and
    associates and people who i work with who i'd like to keep in touch<BR/><BR/>generally,
    myspace is full of kids, like bebo. facebook may have some appeal for your purposes,
    but i generally consider it too invasive privacy-wise, and wouldn't join a group
    just because i read a blog like this<BR/><BR/>i consider the web presence you
    have here on the blog and the corporate wiki to be good. if people wish to engage
    in discussion about cisco technology, i can see use in it being categorised (like
    in a forum), or just quick instant help (like an irc channel)

  html: Hello, Ivan.<BR/>I'd say it really depends. What is your expectations from
    social networking? If you want to participate in discussions and find interesting
    people to connect it might be linkedin. The problem with it - limited functionality
    comparing to facebook. There is no ability to share some video or photos, as well
    as create some event and invite people. <BR/>So, as usual right question it's
    at least half of answer. :)

  html: I use LinkedIn for professional and Myspace for friends.  It seems to work
    pretty well as long as you don't get sucked into all of the extra applications
    on Myspace.  I have some limited success with making contacts through LinkedIn
    and I have even received a few job offers.
