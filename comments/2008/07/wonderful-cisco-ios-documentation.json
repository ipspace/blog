In general, I'm very disappointed in the functionality and performance in Cisco's site.  For a networking company - it should perform second to none.  Oh, and can someone help cisco understand 'single sign-on' for the cisco.com website",

If you want to dig a bit deeper into the IOS history, it becomes useless. <BR/><BR/>For example, the <A HREF=\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/iproute/command/reference/irp_pi1.html#wp1015004\" REL=\"nofollow\">maximum-paths</A> entry in 12.4 command reference claims the command was introduced in 12.2T (wrong, it was in 11.2 mainstream) and it does not tell when it was implemented in BGP (also 11.2). The data on when the maximum number of parallel routes has been increased is also incomplete.",
