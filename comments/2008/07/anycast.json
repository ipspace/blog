There are many many large anycast clouds serving thousands of tcp sessions.<BR/><BR/>A couple of papers on anycast + tcp:<BR/><BR/>http://www.nanog.org/mtg-0606/pdf/matt.levine.pdf<BR/>http://www.netcat.ca/tag/tcp-anycast/<BR/><BR/>It is true that if the node goes down that the tcp sessions would fail, however, that is the case if you're using anycast or not.",

      "html": "I want to agree and expand upon Patrick's comments - multi-tier Web applications typically don't carry a lot of state on the front-end in the first place, and, secondly, if you're experiencing so many fluctuations in your IGP that this would be problematic at the TCP level, you've larger problems which need solving first, anyways.<BR/><BR/>The best way to do anycasting is to run a routing daemon on the host, so as to minimize the risk of blackholing traffic in the event of a host outage.",

      "html": "The problem with TCP-over-Anycast is that the change in global BGP state (nothing to do with the stability of the servers or IGP) could redirect the end-user's traffic to another Anycast server, resulting in disrupted TCP session. The presentation Patrick mentioned in his comment admits and addresses this concern in numerous ways:<BR/><BR/>* Your upstream ISP has to provide effective BGP communities (#4)<BR/>* Coasts and countries appear to provide enough padding for route instability (#6)<BR/>* Nodes that are near by could possibly require state between each node if routes are unstable (#6)<BR/>* There's also the \"Gotchas\" slide (#20)<BR/><BR/>However, the actual statistical data they've provided (#19) indicate that the failure rate is so low that you can ignore it, meaning that although my reservations were valid, they were mostly academic :) Thanks for pointing that out.",
