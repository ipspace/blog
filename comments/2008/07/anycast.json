         "html": "The problem with TCP-over-Anycast is that the change in global BGP state (nothing to do with the stability of the servers or IGP) could redirect the end-user's traffic to another Anycast server, resulting in disrupted TCP session. The presentation Patrick mentioned in his comment admits and addresses this concern in numerous ways:<BR/><BR/>* Your upstream ISP has to provide effective BGP communities (#4)<BR/>* Coasts and countries appear to provide enough padding for route instability (#6)<BR/>* Nodes that are near by could possibly require state between each node if routes are unstable (#6)<BR/>* There's also the \"Gotchas\" slide (#20)<BR/><BR/>However, the actual statistical data they've provided (#19) indicate that the failure rate is so low that you can ignore it, meaning that although my reservations were valid, they were mostly academic :) Thanks for pointing that out.",
