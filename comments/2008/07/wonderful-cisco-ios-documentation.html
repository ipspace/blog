            <div class="comment-content">I completely agree - I have yet to see what the documentation DVD looks like now, but I'm assuming it's some sort of local webserver emulating the cisco site.  In general, I'm very disappointed in the functionality and performance in Cisco's site.  For a networking company - it should perform second to none.  Oh, and can someone help cisco understand 'single sign-on' for the cisco.com website</div>

Please see the Release Notes here:<BR/><BR/>http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/11_2/release/notes/rn112.html#wp33702<BR/><BR/>Read the new features for BGP4 Enhancement and in there you will find BGP4 Multipath Support.<BR/><BR/>Yes, I agree that the new Web 2.0 web site from Cisco is making harder for most of us to find information.

            <div class="comment-content">@Scott: When you get the DVD, let me know how it works.<BR/><BR/>@Steve: Tried mine, doesn't work for me. Interesting though :)<BR/><BR/>@William: Thanks. In the end I decided to use Feature Navigator and found it ... also I should remember to use the Release Notes more often.<BR/><BR/>@Whisper: This is what I was doing internally almost 15 years ago. Whenever an engineer would ask a question, I would reply only with the steps needed to find the answer on CCO :))</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Thanks, I'm well aware of the "Command history" section and it's usually of great use for newly-introduced commands. If you want to dig a bit deeper into the IOS history, it becomes useless. <BR/><BR/>For example, the <A HREF="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/iproute/command/reference/irp_pi1.html#wp1015004" REL="nofollow">maximum-paths</A> entry in 12.4 command reference claims the command was introduced in 12.2T (wrong, it was in 11.2 mainstream) and it does not tell when it was implemented in BGP (also 11.2). The data on when the maximum number of parallel routes has been increased is also incomplete.</div>
