  html: Is it possible to use any of the methods for outbound policing on 3560/3750
    switches (not the E versions).  It does not seem like its possible on these platforms
    for outbound traffic only inbound.

  html: I am no switching guru (and my document covers solely software-based router
    platforms), but uncle Google provided <A HREF="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps646/products_tech_note09186a00800feff5.shtml"
    REL="nofollow">this document</A> when asked about "Catalyst 3550 policing".<BR/><BR/>Reading
    it, I would assume you can do inbound and outbound policing on Cat3550, but I
    haven't tried it.
