  html: The OSPF idea is good :) You'll get the script ... just give me some time
    ;)<BR/><BR/>As for the MVPN question, I have to think it through; I'm no multicast
    guru.

  html: 'Hi, <BR/><BR/>I''m just starting to work with tcl scripts. I found the arp.tcl
    and it workt fine. However, when I execute the command on our Cisco Catalyst 6513
    running on IOS s72033-advipservicesk9_wan-mz.122-18.SXF14.bin we do not see the
    physical interface. <BR/><BR/>If I run a show -mac-addres-table command myself
    teh output looks like: <BR/><BR/> vlan   mac address     type    learn     age              ports<BR/><BR/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR/>+----------------+--------+-----+----------+--------------------------

  html: dhcp snooping feature on L3 switch can get you the same information as arp.tc
    script.<br />It need configure dhcp snooping, wait filling of dhcp snooping database.
    Enter:<br />sh ip dhcp snoop bin
