  html: 'this line: <I> The default route is originated only when a major network
    is matched (tested in IOS release 12.2SRC). You cannot originate a default route
    based on the presence of a subnet or a supernet.<BR/></I><BR/><BR/>Can i not match
    on a network in my BGP table, to tell if BGP is up (and working)?<BR/><BR/>i tried
    this:<BR/><BR/>+ ip access-list standard GOOGLE                                                <BR/>+  permit
    72.14.192.0                                                           <BR/>+ !   <BR/>+
    route-map GOOGLE permit 10                                                    <BR/>+  match
    ip address GOOGLE                                                      <BR/>+
    !    <BR/>+  default-information originate always metric 10 route-map GOOGLE  <BR/><BR/>and
    OSPF won''t default-originate (though of course that network is in the table (twice!)).'

  html: 'As I wrote (and you quoted): <I>The default route is originated only when
    a major network is matched</I>. 72.14.192.0/24 is not a major network, 72.0.0.0/8
    is.'
