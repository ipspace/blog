      "html": "I must agree with most sentiments expressed.  I have been an active CCIE for ten years now.  When Cisco first started the recertification program I was supporter as it did involve a continuing education requirement with CCIE level courses available.  That soon faded and was replaced by testing which in the beginning was also technology specific and updated.  Then that also faded and now it is the foundation test every two years.  In my opinion the continuing education requirement would be much more beneficial with or without a test.  If my employer did not require the CCIE I would be tempted to let mine lapse as well.  I know a few other long time CCIE's who have also allowed their cert to expire.  We have had sessions with Cisco on this but they don't seem to want to listen and sometimes I think they just like the cash flow from the testing.",

Certainly that's happened, but passing the lab exam was most definitely not a cure-all.<BR/><BR/>Since there is no financial benefit to being certified (at least not in my specific situation), I feel as if my time will be better spent educating myself about the technologies I need to make my network function better.  A greater familiarity with the ubiquitous 6500 platform and planning design enhancements to improve resiliency during failures are issues not addressed by the CCIE program that are highly relevant to my day-to-day world.",

I have two questions though, 1) I&#39;m not sure what all the 10 year+ guys are complaining about, you are all eligible for life membership under the 10+ plus CCIE rule that is now in place. Check it out at the CCIE support site. 2) It&#39;s very easy to say its not worth recertifying, but just wait till your searching for a new job and going up against other current CCIE&#39;s, it looks bad. It&#39;s a very competitive world out there, China is producing 300+ CCIE&#39;s a month, this translates to a lot of competition in the job market. It&#39;s one of those things that you never know what&#39;s going to happen around the corner job wise. I&#39;ll also tell you that the R&amp;S LAB exam is progressively harder every year due to the high passing numbers they continually make it hard and hard, unlike the voice and service provider one. If you ever have to re-cert the lab, you&#39;ll be in for a big surprise.",

During my last recert in March 2008, I saw several questions that asked for the \"best\" answer and provided multiple correct answers.  The problem is that the question is scored in a binary pass / fail with no partial credit... forcing me to guess what someone else subjectively said was best at $300 per test and a six hour round-trip.  I'm not ashamed to say I had to take the silly thing twice before passing... this doesn't even include obviously absurd questions on the R/S recert that any person with knowledge of TCP would laugh at... in this case it amounted to figuring out which one of the answers given was \"least wrong\".<BR/><BR/>In all, I'm not sorry I have the CCIE and I'll continue to recert.",

If you have a significant body of work that is verifiable, chances are you'll never need a CCIE to begin with.  Experience and actual knowledge count very highly, again unless you're working for a channel partner.<BR/><BR/>  I don't agree with a 10-year automagic certification for life award, but the fact that you can say that you maintained a CCIE for 10 years (5 recerts potentially) is in and of itself an accomplishment.<BR/><BR/>  I agree that the recertification process is 'annoying', but it's not really that expensive (although living in BFE and adding in fuel cost and it's not a vacation you want to pay for).   If you're not making enough money as a CCIE-level networking professional you're doing something wrong or you've overextended your finances to complain about the minimal cost of the recert.   Also, ask your employer to pay for it.<BR/><BR/>  I love the idea of continuing education.<BR/><BR/>  I focus on the technology and as such it has allowed me to thrive in every NEM's product-line, in addition to actually implementing all the major protocols (routing and otherwise) from the ground-up at a new NEM.   <BR/><BR/>Believe me, if you think you know the technologies, try protocol implementation/analysis and you'll find out quickly that you take things for granted as a typical network engineer... things like 'turning on LDP' or 'configuring IPSec peers utilizing ISAKMP for keying', so on and so forth.   So that's an interesting career path for those who love to dissect specifications and know the protocols and operational configuration of multi-vendor equipment.<BR/><BR/>  If you're a younger engineer, by all means acquire some level of certification.   If it allows you to get your foot in the door somewhere to gain experience, then do it.   Don't be concerned what people think about certifications, just apply yourself and do the best job you can because that's really what counts.",

I've been told that Cisco gives test centers a quota of how many tests per month they must administer or they charge an additional $20/student for the privilege of tha center giving the test... how this makes sense is beyond me.  Comments about money don't indicate that I don't have it to pay... I simply object to paying so much for a test with such obviously bad quality control.

If you were out of the field of for 2 decades... Do not insult us by coming back into the field and writing a &quot;scholarly&quot; book on a topic that you were an expert on 20 years ago. Technology moves fast. You need to force people to re-prove themselves. Its degrees and only degrees that have that horribly epic fail problem. Its an artifact from a time when your degree was your career. Its stupid. Renew or get a new career.",

Convert that to EUR and consider that there are usually no hidden employer expenses in US (like health or pension insurance in Europe) - you have to compare 70K with your gross-gross salary (which you never see on your paycheck).",

At this point there is no financial gain as I will not make any more money but I suppose it would be fun from a learning perspective.<br /><br />I will say without a doubt that a CCIE or any other cert does not make anyone an expert. That comes with experience and the hands on knowledge that is not going to be found in a book or exam. You dont need to have a CCIE to work your way up to a six figure salary and be at the top of your game. My point is that handing Cisco thousands of dollars to get these certs is not going to open a magic door with lots of money.  I lived in books and had years of experience which helped me get where I am. The learning was more important to me than getting certs. No disrespect to those who have achieved any cert but there are many paths to success....<br />",

Why on earth a complacent CCIE in R&amp;S wouldn&#39;t pursue security or voice is beyond me. I work as a network engineer, studying for the CCIE in R&amp;S and security. I have been pushed into voice by my employer, at first a little aggravated but now ok with it. I dream about the day I get the email to look for the &quot;PASS&quot; and my number. If your looking for a challenge pickup a different track. Or don&#39;t, but don&#39;t whine about a recert test you&#39;ve taken multiple times. Focus on what you don&#39;t know and attempt that. I read a few that said they recommend the CCIE to younger engineers. I have a hard time with this, you bag on it and then encourage it? Sounds to me like you don&#39;t get challenged. ",
