  html: I completely agree - I have yet to see what the documentation DVD looks like
    now, but I'm assuming it's some sort of local webserver emulating the cisco site.  In
    general, I'm very disappointed in the functionality and performance in Cisco's
    site.  For a networking company - it should perform second to none.  Oh, and can
    someone help cisco understand 'single sign-on' for the cisco.com website

  html: have you also noticed that expired CCO account passwords still work? I can
    sign in with four different passwords for the same CCO account...

  html: It was first supported in IOS 11.2 mainline. Please see the Release Notes
    here:<BR/><BR/>http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/11_2/release/notes/rn112.html#wp33702<BR/><BR/>Read
    the new features for BGP4 Enhancement and in there you will find BGP4 Multipath
    Support.<BR/><BR/>Yes, I agree that the new Web 2.0 web site from Cisco is making
    harder for most of us to find information. I used to be able to find informaion
    quickly but not anymore...

  html: '@Scott: When you get the DVD, let me know how it works.<BR/><BR/>@Steve:
    Tried mine, doesn''t work for me. Interesting though :)<BR/><BR/>@William: Thanks.
    In the end I decided to use Feature Navigator and found it ... also I should remember
    to use the Release Notes more often.<BR/><BR/>@Whisper: This is what I was doing
    internally almost 15 years ago. Whenever an engineer would ask a question, I would
    reply only with the steps needed to find the answer on CCO :))'

  html: I was talking to a Cisco engineer in the Advanced Services group the other
    day and he commented that a critical part of being a productive engineer at Cisco
    is to know who to ask for important URLs when the internal search tools fail.
    :-)

  html: Ivan, in the command reference there is a Command History section for each
    command which tells you when it was introduced.

  html: Thanks, I'm well aware of the "Command history" section and it's usually of
    great use for newly-introduced commands. If you want to dig a bit deeper into
    the IOS history, it becomes useless. <BR/><BR/>For example, the <A HREF="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/iproute/command/reference/irp_pi1.html#wp1015004"
    REL="nofollow">maximum-paths</A> entry in 12.4 command reference claims the command
    was introduced in 12.2T (wrong, it was in 11.2 mainstream) and it does not tell
    when it was implemented in BGP (also 11.2). The data on when the maximum number
    of parallel routes has been increased is also incomplete.
