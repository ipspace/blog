If it's more detailed and needs other input, use the wiki.<BR/><BR/>In either case, I'm hitting those sites.  Most of the stuff you post is over my head (for now), but I very often do run across items to pass on to my colleagues.<BR/><BR/>Your blog is in my RSS reader and your wiki is bookmarked.<BR/><BR/>Thanks for all you do!",
