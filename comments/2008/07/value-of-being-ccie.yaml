  html: Looks like good information, another good place to gor for information would
    be the Cisco website. I recently got my CCNA from there and i'd recommend it for
    anyone who's looking for information on CCA certs or anything else in IT.<BR/><BR/>https://cisco.hosted.jivesoftware.com/index.jspa?ciscoHome=true?utm_source<BR/>=blog+commenting&utm_medium=media&utm_content=Google&utm_campaign=Domestic

  html: A CCIE is valuable when job-hunting (particularly since some jobs require
    it). Beyond that, its a continuing cost and annoyance that occurs every other
    year, until you finally get fed up and chuck it. I know a few people who've had
    it over 10 years, and the feeling is always the same - we re-certify because it
    was so hard to get in the first place, but its a bitter pill. The CCIE holds a
    high status, but there's no growth in it.

  html: Anyone looking at the URL "ecrunner" posted could figure out that it's part
    of a marketing campain where someone is paid to insert blog comments pointing
    to Cisco's new learning site.<BR/><BR/>Nice move, Cisco. Congratulations. This
    will definitely help improve your image in blogging audiences.

  html: There are professional certifications that are associated with academic degrees
    that do have recertification requirements.<BR/><BR/>Here in the US at least, you
    get a 4-year degree in medicine (MD), but you can't practice medicine without
    meeting renewable licensing requirements.<BR/><BR/>I'm not sure this is directly
    comparable to the CCIE, but neither to I think that the academic degree is directly
    comparable.

  html: '<I>&gt; (anyone aware of any other certifications that involve a day in an
    actual lab?)</I><BR/><BR/>At least one : Check Point Master Architect (kind of
    CCIE Security by Check Point). <BR/>Sadly, there is a lack of 8-hour hands-on
    exams for Juniper security appliances (no JNCIE Security).'
