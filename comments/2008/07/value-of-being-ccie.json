      "html": "A CCIE is valuable when job-hunting (particularly since some jobs require it). Beyond that, its a continuing cost and annoyance that occurs every other year, until you finally get fed up and chuck it. I know a few people who've had it over 10 years, and the feeling is always the same - we re-certify because it was so hard to get in the first place, but its a bitter pill. The CCIE holds a high status, but there's no growth in it.",
