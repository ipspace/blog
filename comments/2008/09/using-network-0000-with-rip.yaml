  html: That surprises me. I would have thought that it would have advertised on any
    interface whose network was 0.0.0.0-0.255.255.255.  I typed the command on my
    router and it did advertise on all interfaces.

  html: 'Yes, that works, I tried it with IOS 12.3 and 12.3T.<BR/>BUT: As far as I
    can remember it worked only if the command was entered while the router was running
    but not after a reload. After a reload, the command was still in the startup-
    and running-config but the routing didn''t work.<BR/>You had to re-enter the command
    to get it running...<BR/><BR/>But who cares about RIP "Rest In Peace" Routing...
    ;-)'

  html: And if there exists a default route in the routing table, the statement "network
    0.0.0.0" would inject a default route into the RIP domain apart from advertising
    all interfaces.<BR/><BR/>sharath
