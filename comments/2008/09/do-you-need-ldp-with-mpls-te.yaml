  html: Does this mean it is possible to do MPLS TE in an IP only net work aslong
    as you are doing the tunnels between PEs, and BGP on the PEs only? and if you
    have full/partial mesh of MPLS TE Tunnels can you also do MPLS VPN on an IP only
    network?<BR/><BR/>Your graphics are nice, but it would be verry nice to see some
    config examples as well.

  html: '@Justin:<BR/><BR/>"Does this mean it is possible to do MPLS TE in an IP only
    net work aslong as you are doing the tunnels between PEs, and BGP on the PEs only?"<BR/><BR/>In
    theory yes, but if your tunnels break down for any reason (for example, the tunnel
    could not be established due to insufficient free bandwidth), your transit traffic
    would be blackholed.<BR/><BR/>"if you have full/partial mesh of MPLS TE Tunnels
    can you also do MPLS VPN on an IP only network?"<BR/><BR/>Yes ... with the same
    caveats as above.<BR/><BR/>"Your graphics are nice, but it would be verry nice
    to see some config examples as well."<BR/><BR/>I''ll do the MPLS/VPN over IP network
    setup and post the results.'

  html: Precisely.  Great write up.  If the network is designed properly, you should
    never need LDP.  There are a few knobs to consider if you are running a multi-vendor
    TE domain.  Not sure if there is interest in that on this blog, though.
