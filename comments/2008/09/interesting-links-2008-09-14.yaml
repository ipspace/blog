  html: Hi Gernot!<BR/><BR/>Thanks for bringing that blog to my attention. As you've
    guessed, I'm primarily publishing links to blog posts focused on technical details
    similar to topics I'm discussing in my blog ... and I'm well aware there are tons
    of other good things out there.<BR/><BR/>Best regards<BR/>Ivan
