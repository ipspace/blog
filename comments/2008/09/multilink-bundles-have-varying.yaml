  html: You are very much right, I want to add one more thing that1200 bytes are used
    for single interface for buffers. One more problem which I have checked in our
    environment which is the problem of multilink when it goes to 9 E1.If i use 9
    e1s for a multilink it goes hang and if i remove the e1 and get it back to 8 or
    less than 8 it works fine.<BR/>Any experience on this.

  html: 'I think it depends on particular h/w heavily. I&#39;ve got positive experience
    w/ 12xE1 bundle on 7206VXR/NPE-G1 (12.3 mainline).<BR/><BR/>Note: Big number of
    physical links may cause extensive reordering of fragments --&gt; less efficiency/high
    CPU usage.'

  html: I am using 7206VXR/NPE-400 with 12.4. But still the problem persists. Not
    able to understand whats the reason.

  html: As Uri told you, it's probably hardware dependent. You should open a case
    with Cisco TAC.

  html: Did you even notice, 1/4 was configured with bandwitdth 2000 and 1/5 bandwith
    4000.  Hence the 4000 bandwidth with 1/4 shutdown makes perfect sense.

  html: Of course I noticed :) The point of the post was that the interface bandwidth
    changes dynamically based on what's in the bundle.
