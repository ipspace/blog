      "html": "Sorry, my bad...<br /><br />I saw the title and then the link seemed to have nothing to do with it. It all made sense after reading it. :)<br /><br />However, I noticed that the blog entries that point to wiki articles \"behave\" differently than the \"stand-alone\" blog entries. The difference is seen when clicking on the title vs. clicking on more. In the first case, clicking on the title takes you to the wiki, so, in order to see the comments (or the rest of the blog entry, like in this case), you need to click on \"More\". In the second case, clicking on the title or More (obviously) takes you to the content (and comments) of the blog entry.<br /><br />Just an observation, I don't see this as a bug.",
