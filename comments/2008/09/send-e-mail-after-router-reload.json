They did introduce some new EEM functionality in IOS release 12.4(20)T and it might cause the crash dump you're experiencing (but that's a bug; in principle, the script should work anywhere). <BR/><BR/>I was probably testing this particular script on 12.4(15)Tx. I usually use the latest maintenance build of 12.4(15)T unless I'm testing newer features.",

      "html": "Thanks for your response. I've tested with a 1751 I'm using for telephony with IOS 12.4-15T8.<BR/><BR/>Changing 1.0 to 1.2 in the last line of the script works like a charm! <BR/><BR/>In the test with the 1700 I've seen that the last sentence (1.0 syslog) erase the first sentence (1.0 info type routername). This makes the router stop the script telling there is an error (non configured variable $_info_routername). Maybe the 878 is unable to give that information and simply hangs (new error reporting system in 22T doesn't work?). I'll give a next try with the modified script and the 878 reporting results.<BR/><BR/>It's always good to know when the remote routers are reloaded, it would be good to have another variable for adding inside the mail the reason of the reload (sci-fi?)",

It works like a charm!!!<BR/><BR/>I've had to upper the countdown timer for the applet to 110 seconds due to a PPP DSL delay with high load on start with the 870 loading IPSs. (Maybe IOS stop binding PPP dialing till all the IPS are loaded? The interface dialer is binding and unbinding till all IPSs are loaded, high load? IOS protecting on start?). I've tried all, generate traffic, but only worked uppering the delay...<BR/><BR/>In the next days I'll begin a deploy in all the (870-2800) remote routers...<BR/><BR/>Thanks for the info!",
