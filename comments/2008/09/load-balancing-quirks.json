In this case, R2 or R3 have to craft the actual traceroute packet, and in doing so its process switched -- and hence load-balanced across both links.",

      "html": "Hello if we modify the above diagram and instead of 2 links between R2 and R3 we take<br /><br />- 1 of the links and put it to another device say R2 to R5 <br />- R5 has another link to R4<br /><br />If you do a extended traceroute from R2 with probe count of 1 is this behavior normal/possible<br /><br />1.First probe packet with ttl 1 gets sent to R3 than the icmp-time-exceeded reply comes from R3 hence the R3 ip address gets recorded as the first path<br /><br />2. R2 sends another probe with ttl 2 which now instead gets sent to R5 and than to R4 however the ip that gets recorded is of the link between R5 and R4<br /><br />This actually than means that traceroute will not depict an accurate picture. Can you please confirm if this is normal and hence to get a normal accurate traceroute what needs to be done when troubleshooting.",
