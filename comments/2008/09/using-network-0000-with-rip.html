            <div class="comment-content">That surprises me. I would have thought that it would have advertised on any interface whose network was 0.0.0.0-0.255.255.255.  I typed the command on my router and it did advertise on all interfaces.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Yes, that works, I tried it with IOS 12.3 and 12.3T.<BR/>BUT: As far as I can remember it worked only if the command was entered while the router was running but not after a reload. After a reload, the command was still in the startup- and running-config but the routing didn't work.<BR/>You had to re-enter the command to get it running...<BR/><BR/>But who cares about RIP "Rest In Peace" Routing... ;-)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">And if there exists a default route in the routing table, the statement "network 0.0.0.0" would inject a default route into the RIP domain apart from advertising all interfaces.<BR/><BR/>sharath</div>
