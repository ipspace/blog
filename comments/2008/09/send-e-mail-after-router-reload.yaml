  html: Nice scrip!<BR/><BR/>I've configured this on a 878 12.4-22T. The result has
    been a really big crashdump ending in a force reload (it's not a good think to
    happen with something that executes at each reload...).<BR/><BR/>Maybe some of
    the commands are incompatible with the lowest of the ISRs?

  html: Nothing in the script should be platform-dependent. They did introduce some
    new EEM functionality in IOS release 12.4(20)T and it might cause the crash dump
    you're experiencing (but that's a bug; in principle, the script should work anywhere).
    <BR/><BR/>I was probably testing this particular script on 12.4(15)Tx. I usually
    use the latest maintenance build of 12.4(15)T unless I'm testing newer features.

  html: Thanks for your response. I've tested with a 1751 I'm using for telephony
    with IOS 12.4-15T8.<BR/><BR/>Changing 1.0 to 1.2 in the last line of the script
    works like a charm! <BR/><BR/>In the test with the 1700 I've seen that the last
    sentence (1.0 syslog) erase the first sentence (1.0 info type routername). This
    makes the router stop the script telling there is an error (non configured variable
    $_info_routername). Maybe the 878 is unable to give that information and simply
    hangs (new error reporting system in 22T doesn't work?). I'll give a next try
    with the modified script and the 878 reporting results.<BR/><BR/>It's always good
    to know when the remote routers are reloaded, it would be good to have another
    variable for adding inside the mail the reason of the reload (sci-fi?)

  html: I couldn't wait to test and report (it's 2AM here in Spain) but I've finished
    testing with the 878. It works like a charm!!!<BR/><BR/>I've had to upper the
    countdown timer for the applet to 110 seconds due to a PPP DSL delay with high
    load on start with the 870 loading IPSs. (Maybe IOS stop binding PPP dialing till
    all the IPS are loaded? The interface dialer is binding and unbinding till all
    IPSs are loaded, high load? IOS protecting on start?). I've tried all, generate
    traffic, but only worked uppering the delay...<BR/><BR/>In the next days I'll
    begin a deploy in all the (870-2800) remote routers...<BR/><BR/>Thanks for the
    info!

  html: How can i specify username and password for SMTP authentication as well as
    a different port for SMTP. Does EEM also support SSL-SMTP?<br /><br />Thanks.<br

  html: I haven't found anything that would allow you to do that with the "action
    mail" command (unless there's something new in EEM 3.0, I haven't checked that
    one yet).<br /><br />You can always write a Tcl policy that handles the SMTP protocol
    (but of course that's much more complex than a simple EEM applet).

  html: 'Update for Mr. Anonymous: I''ve just checked the latest-and-greatest IOS
    release (12.4(24)T) which includes EEM 3.0 and the only option they''ve added
    to the ''action mail'' command is the ability to specify source interface (or
    IP address).<br /><br />If you really need this functionality and have a big enough
    network, you could try asking for the feature through your Cisco SE/AM.'

  html: Considering most SMTP implementations require some sort of authentication
    I&#39;d say this is am much needed item.  However not exactly sure how involved
    it would be to get something like this programmed into EEM.  Would love to see
    it though.

  html: Server-to-server SMTP (at least inter-domain ones) is never authenticated.
    Only the workstation-to-server sessions are (trying to minimize the spam).

  html: Hi There,<br /><br />I was just browsing some of the EEM articles here and
    came across this one (sorry for ressurecting an old thread).<br /><br />I&#39;m
    new to the whole EEM scene, but from the documentation I&#39;ve been reading from
    Cisco, you can set the _email_server environment variable to use a username:password@host
    format.  Does that accomplish the authentication you&#39;re looking for?
