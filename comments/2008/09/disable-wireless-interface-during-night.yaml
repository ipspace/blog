  html: It could be done on Access point if its PoE-powered. Shut and no shut the
    port will do the trick.

  html: While applying an access-list has it's advantages, it's not the same as shutting
    down an interface.  There are always different scenarios for every unique situation
    and having the ability to physically shut off a wireless interface on an access
    point based on time of day could be useful.

  html: This EEM stuff is neat.  Is it possible to trigger an EEM applet whenever
    the WAN Ethernet interface gets a new DHCP lease, or when the DHCP-assigned default
    gateway changes?

  html: We have a router with two Ethernet WAN interfaces connecting us to two ISPs.  One
    of the WAN connections is slower, but more reliable and provides us with static
    addresses; the other is much faster (cable modem), but only has a single IP address
    assigned by DHCP.  So to make the most of both, we use route maps to push the
    majority of traffic that originates inside our network over the cable modem (through
    overloaded dynamic NAT) while reserving the other WAN for incoming traffic addressed
    to our static IPs (via static NAT to specific inside hosts).<BR/><BR/>Since the
    cable modem ISP is the default route for most traffic, we wanted the ability to
    fall back to the other WAN link if the cable modem network should go down.  To
    address this, we track the DHCP-assigned route with "ip dhcp client route track"
    and we also use an SLA with RTR to monitor that link by ensuring we can ping that
    router.  If we can't get packets through the cable modem link, the SLA setup takes
    the cable modem route out of circulation and all traffic get shunted over the
    other WAN link (again with overloaded dynamic NAT).<BR/><BR/>The cable modem ISP
    is pretty good about renewing leases, such that this router has been able to keep
    the same "dynamic" IP address for the past 4 years.  This is fortunate, because
    the IOS doesn't seem to have a way to set the SLA to ping a DHCP-assigned gateway
    address and so we've had to statically configure the ISP's default gateway's IP
    address in our SLA config.<BR/><BR/>It all works very well, even though statically-configuring
    the router's IP in the SLA is less-than-ideal.  Here's where the problem comes
    in, though:<BR/><BR/>Recently, the ISP renumbered their network, and assigned
    us a new IP address by DHCP.  This of course caused the SLA stuff to break until
    we went in and changed the SLA config to ping the ISP's router's new address.  Every
    time the ISP changes their network in the future, we'll have to do this again.<BR/><BR/>While
    this might be something that only comes up every year or two, it could also turn
    out to happen a lot more often (for example, if the ISP changes their policies
    on long-lived DHCP leases).  So, my hope is to use IOS' EEM capabilities to automate
    the process of noticing that the DHCP-assigned default gateway has changed and
    then automatically update the SLA when that happens.<BR/><BR/>Any thoughts on
    whether this would be possible?<BR/><BR/>Thanks!

  html: 'slightly OT for this IOS blog, but as David asked in the second response:-<BR/>For
    cheap/plastic/non-industrial Access Points the easiest solution is a mains-plug-in-the-socket
    timeswitch, either rotary "peg-type" or digital. Don''t forget summer/daylight
    changes or if less critical allow an extra couple of hours either way.<BR/>More
    complex but scriptable is to switch the DC power lead to the Access Point via
    a suitable relay, maybe fed from a LPT port (and a Molex or Berg power conn for
    relay power: look for transistor relay-driver circuits on net) Linux+lptswitch
    will do it on an old 486, so its SSH-able and tcl-able, or you can simply script
    it locally. If the cheap access point is near (5-10metres) some server boxes with
    LPT ports this is easier than a headless-but-huge 1998 desktop on a shelf running
    ssh :)<BR/>POE is really the way to do it for non-IOS devices IMHelectronicO<BR/>(Gord
    as anon)'

  html: There are also "power control" devices on the market. You can telnet/HTTP
    to such a device and turn the power off or on (or trigger a power-off of controlled
    length to power-cycle a box).

  html: 'Back to Jordan&#39;s question.  I believe it is possible.  You didn&#39;t
    mention what device/IOS/EEM version you are running but you should be able to
    look for this syslog message<br /><br />%DHCP-6-ADDRESS_ASSIGN: Interface Ethernet0/0
    assigned DHCP address 10.10.1.2, mask 255.255.255.0, hostname R2<br /><br />Upon
    receiving this message you could compare it to the previous address and if it
    changes update your SLA configuration.'
