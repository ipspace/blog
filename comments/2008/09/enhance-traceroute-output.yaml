  html: 'Hi Ivan,<br /><br />one small glitch: if you click on the title of this post,
    it takes you to http://wiki.nil.com/Generate_hostnames_from_router_configurations
    . Looks like a copy/paste error.'

  html: Sorry, my bad...<br /><br />I saw the title and then the link seemed to have
    nothing to do with it. It all made sense after reading it. :)<br /><br />However,
    I noticed that the blog entries that point to wiki articles "behave" differently
    than the "stand-alone" blog entries. The difference is seen when clicking on the
    title vs. clicking on more. In the first case, clicking on the title takes you
    to the wiki, so, in order to see the comments (or the rest of the blog entry,
    like in this case), you need to click on "More". In the second case, clicking
    on the title or More (obviously) takes you to the content (and comments) of the
    blog entry.<br /><br />Just an observation, I don't see this as a bug.

  html: You're absolutely right. I shouldn't have mixed the partial-page format (with
    the "More ..." link) with the intro-text format (with the title link pointing
    to the target article). It's confusing.<br /><br />I've removed the title link
    from this article.
