Well his blog isn\u00b4t that much a technical blog like yours but very very interesting too. Recently he wrote about \"Interview @ CCIE Lab\".<BR/><BR/><BR/>Regards,<BR/><BR/>Gernot Nusshall",

As you've guessed, I'm primarily publishing links to blog posts focused on technical details similar to topics I'm discussing in my blog ... and I'm well aware there are tons of other good things out there.<BR/><BR/>Best regards<BR/>Ivan",
