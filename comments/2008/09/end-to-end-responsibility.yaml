  html: it does sound like a better system, nobody wants to be lumped with implementation
    of some half-designed technically-impossible network sold to the client at a cutthroat
    rate<BR/><BR/>however, what happens if that "single engineer" leaves the company?

  html: This is a really good point :) There are mechanisms in place to ensure anyone
    from the technical team can figure out the current status of the customer network
    in a short time (the "single engineer" is obviously not always on duty and the
    customer might have a network-down situation in the middle of the night). I will
    write another post describing them.<BR/><BR/>It also helps that people don't quit
    overnight in Europe, so there's always a transition period.

  html: I disagree. The process you mention and dislike is the method carried out
    by the biggest vendors in the world and not just for IP networks and this is the
    network deployment lifecycle. <BR/><BR/>It is not feasible when building carrier
    class networks to do it your way, both logistically and from a scaling the business
    POV. <BR/><BR/>The problems you mention are due to bad management of the life
    cycle rather then the actual life cycle which is indeed proven.<BR/><BR/>I do
    agree your way is very suitable for SMB.<BR/><BR/>cheers (imho)

  html: '@anonymous#2: I guess you''ve mixed "responsibility" with "doing it yourself".  If
    someone is "responsible" for something, it does not mean he has to do it himself
    (which would be indeed non-scalable and logistical nightmare in global deployment).
    The important part is that whoever has signed off the kit list, has to design
    the network with the kit the customer bought and retains responsibility for implementing
    it and getting it running.<BR/><BR/>The problems I see in the "life cycle" you
    like is that the presales team can produce something that works on paper but faces
    implementation issues later on. The probability of this happening is reduced if
    the same engineers have to do a detailed design and lead the implementation.<BR/><BR/>While
    I might agree with you that the approach I''ve described might not scale to huge
    networks, I doubt that <A HREF="http://www.nil.com/C1257455003A036D/html/customers"
    REL="nofollow">some of our customers</A> would like to be called SMB, but our
    opinions might differ.<BR/><BR/>Last but not least, to end my comment on a humorous
    note, just yesterday Scott Adams had <A HREF="http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/2008-09-03/"
    REL="nofollow">something to say about industry practices</A>.<BR/><BR/>And finally,
    I would really appreciate if you could take a few seconds, pick up a name or nick
    and use that. Although we''ll both know your name is not Joe or Hamlet, it will
    be (at least) easier referring to your comments :) and will give them a slightly
    more personal touch.'

  html: hi<BR/><BR/>Fair comments. Guess we need to agree to disagree, although its
    good that we can do this because it hopefully makes people think about evolving
    the whole process anyway.<BR/><BR/>Interesting set of customers. I apologise for
    coming across as patronising (didn't mean to). I also work/worked for/with many
    of those same customers but have not yet bumped into you.<BR/><BR/>Having worked
    almost exclusively in the carrier space. I do wonder if there are certain different
    ways of approaching the same processes as compared with the enterprise space.
    Correct me if I am wrong, but I guess the amount of money spent on a new carrier
    class network must be a more then that of a standard enterprise network and perhaps
    that focuses the mind on said process?<BR/><BR/>cheers (IMHO)
