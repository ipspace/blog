  html: Hi Ivan, the 3rd bullet point should be &quot;network route-map in&quot; instead
    of simply &quot;network route-map&quot;. Thanks. 8-)

  html: Nope, it&#39;s correct syntax. It&#39;s a route map applied to a network statement,
    not to a neighbor.

  html: Thanks for this post ; I was wondering if there was some restriction for the
    &quot;set community&quot; with the route-maps (ie, in input or output), this make
    things very clear :)

  html: Hi Ivan, <br /><br />I appreciate if you can write a short form of a post
    about the usage of &quot;network route-map&quot; command, as it&#39;s unclear
    to many people. In addition, there are very few and rare documents which explain
    the usage of route-map with the network command.<br /><br />Thanks Ivan :)

  html: '&quot;network route-map&quot; allows you to set attributes of the BGP network
    you&#39;re originating. In most cases you&#39;d use it to set BGP community or
    MED.'

  html: 'ip bgp new-format can be done to show the community format in the 65001:17
    format instead of the long format.<br /><br />You can also create a community
    list which permits only a specified community... sorta like an as-path access-list.<br
    /><br />Ex. #ip community-list 1 permit 65001:17<br /><br />Then you wan to match
    on that community-list.<br /><br />#route-map CLIST_IN permit 10<br />#match community
    1     (leave off the -list)'

  html: My query is basically in the context of vrf. Suppose a CE comprises multiple
    VRF to connect to different customers and eBGP is used as an PE-CE routing protocol.<br
    /><br />Consider an eBGP route update (without a RT value) is received by a BGP
    peer in a VRF and successfully installed in the VRF routing table.<br />Also consider
    that the same VRF is configured with a export map which has a match criteria for
    this received prefix and set action to attach an RT vlaue (65500:5).<br /><br
    />If there is no requirement exist in this VRF to advertise this received prefix
    to any other BGP peer, will the configured export map come in action to set the
    RT vlaue (6500:5) with the received and already existing prefix entry  in the
    BGP table?

  html: Thanks for confirming the &quot;set community&quot; overwrites any existing
    Community values; been Cisco&#39;d with that kind of &quot;obvious&quot; behaviour
    before...
