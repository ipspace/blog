  html: I don&#39;t know the internal details, but it appears from the outside like
    the BGP process would convert AS path into a string that you can see in the &quot;show
    ip bgp&quot; printout, and match that string with the regular expression. Helps?

    html: That would stop the route leaking - you&#39;d advertise your own routes
      and nothing else (which is the right thing to do).<br /><br />To make sure someone
      is not misusing you for transit and sending you traffic regardless of what you
      announce, you&#39;d have to deploy packet filters on the ISP-facing interfaces.
      Probably not worth the effort from the traffic flow perspective these days (but
      might be worth it from security perspective).
