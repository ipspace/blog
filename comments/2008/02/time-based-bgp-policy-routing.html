            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan :)<BR/><BR/>Yep, i've been told about the EEM solution a number of times already ;) It really is nice! However, to me, EEM is an "imperative language like" feature, that "tells" router exactly what to do and how to do it. <BR/><BR/>The beauty of (overall creepy :) reliable static routes solution is its "declarative" (descriptive) behavior, so very much native to IOS configuration style :)<BR/><BR/>EEM is powerful - I just like to find solutions that are built around IOS internal logic :) For real world, obviously, anyone should prefer the most simple way to do things :)<BR/><BR/>--<BR/><BR/>Petr Lapukhov<BR/><BR/>PS<BR/>Yes, i'm a declarative languages fan :) At least, i've been for quite some time in the past.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Petr!<BR/><BR/>I agree with your definition of imperative vs. declarative languages ;) and I also like XSLT (and worked with Prolog in my academic days), but in most cases ease-of-implementation and (even more important) ease-of-maintenance wins over my personal preferences :)<BR/><BR/>Keep up the good work!<BR/>Ivan</div>
