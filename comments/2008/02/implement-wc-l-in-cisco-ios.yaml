  html: 'The "vertical bar" in the example should be the "usual" vertical bar (ASCII
    code 0x7C : |). <BR/><BR/>However, Blogger has the tendency to silently "eat"
    this character, so I''m replacing it with the "broken vertical bar" (Unicode 0xA6),
    which is not recognized by the router if you do straight cut-and-paste from the
    text.'
