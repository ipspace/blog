Referring to your topology, it would be prudent for a non-bkbone router (in Area 1) to select the E-route coming from its direct neighbor (or even adjacent neighbor) rather via another router (connected backbone router). Well again, the confusion would arise what would the ABR (connected to backbone ASBR and Area1) do? <BR/>Jishnu",

          "html": "There are two ways to get into section 16.4.1 of RFC 2328:<br /><br />1. When you have multiple paths to the same ASBR. This will happen in the 16.4(3) step. In this case, both the metric type and the E2 metric value will be ignored when preferring the intra-area path to the same ASBR over a backbone or inter-area path to the ASBR. Comparing E2 metric values at this stage of the path preference algorithm is pointless. We are not comparing AS-external LSAs from different ASBRs to find the best AS-external LSA (and in turn the best ASBR). We are at this point of the algorithm still trying to find the best path to this AS-external LSA&#39;s ASBR. Even of we go to section 16.4.1 and come back, the LSA&#39;s cost will be compared to other LSA&#39;s costs at step 16.4(6)(b).<br /><br />2. When comparing two paths to the same external prefix via two different ASBRs. This will happen in the 16.4(6)(c) step. In this case, we already know that the E2 metric value is identical for the two AS-external LSAs. This test has happened in step 16.4(6)(b). If the E2 metric values were different, the cheapest of the two AS-external LSAs would have been preferred in step  16.4(6)(b), ending the discussion there, and we would not have reached step  16.4(6)(c). In this case, the intra-area ASBR is preferable to the backbone or inter-area ASBR for the two equal-cost AS-external LSAs.<br /><br />So, as per RFC 2328, E2 metric value is king. The lowest E2 metric value is always preferred. The 16.4.1 section only affects how the path to the ASBR is determined, and which ASBR will be chosen in the case of equal E2 metric values.<br /><br />Cisco IOS implements none of these two cases.",
