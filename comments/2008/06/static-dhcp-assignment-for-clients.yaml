  html: For most of the modern linux distributions, you can use /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
    to send whatever client-id you want to the dhcp server. This way you do not have
    to change the configuration when you replace your server's or desktop's network
    card.<BR/><BR/>I added the following line to the conf file;<BR/>send dhcp-client-identifier
    01:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx (Replace xx with the mac address you want to use)

  html: My preffered way to solve this problem is define dynamic DHCP pool then look
    into<BR/>show ip dhcp server bindings<BR/>to know how the client was recognized.

  html: '@selcuk: this is what I''ve tried to do, but for whatever reason, my dhclient.conf
    file worked while the machine was running but got ignored/overwritten (I don''t
    remember which one any more) during the boot process. After a few hours, I gave
    up and found an IOS solution (after all, I''m a router-, not a Linux person :)<BR/><BR/>@anonymous:
    that''s exactly what I''m doing, but if you see just the MAC address without the
    01. prefix in the bindings, you don''t know whether it''s a host with broken Client-ID
    calculation (that happens as well) in which case you copy the value in <B>client-id</B>
    parameter, or a host not using the Client-ID at all forcing you to use <B>hardware-address</B>
    parameter.'

  html: instead of using hardware-address you can use client-identifier in the DHCP
    pool options. To see what client-identifier your machines have do a show ip dhcp
    bind *, and you can use that parameter in the pool's configuration

  html: 'Maybe a lot of time passed, but I have still this issue unsolved.<br />I
    placed PXE files on router&#39;s flash to have ability to boot-up (and repair
    using linux tools) any PC which normally has its statically assigned IP address.
    My requirement is: any particular PC should have the same address inside Windows
    and when using embedded PXE boot agent. This is still the same PC! Unfortunately
    Win uses client-id, PXE uses hw mac... and unfortunately man cannot set both:
    client-id and mac address inside single lease :(<br />What can I do if I wont
    have separate static IP sets: for normal operation and for PXE?'

  html: This was very helpful,<br />I had one linux client, and I couldn&#39;t figure
    out why the DHCP reservation wasn&#39;t working like Windows.

  html: 'thanks so much! The Cisco documentation on this is JUST PLAIN WRONG; as they
    say that you should use #hardware-address for bootp processes, and #client-identifier
    for mac address reservations. That just didn&#39;t work, but your solution worked
    just fine. Irritating.  &gt;:o'

    html: Recent IOS release can deal with multiple static clients per pool (methinks).
      No idea about the other problem though :(

  html: So... Ummm... If a device dual-boots a Linux distro and Windows, is there
    a way to deal with that? It looks like entering a &quot;hardware-address&quot;
    wipes out the &quot;client-identifier&quot; and vice versa.<br /><br />Also, if
    you&#39;ve got half a dozen static entries, can they be all in one pool? It looks
    to me like only one entry can be made per pool, which means a heck of a lot of
    extra pools if you&#39;ve got a few devices you want static.

  html: This is perfect, I was wondering why my Linux Mint installation wasn&#39;t
    getting the static ID I had defined for the same machine when running Windows
    8.<br /><br />Why don&#39;t Linux clients supply client identifiers?
