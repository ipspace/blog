  html: Hi Ivan,<BR/><BR/>I just want to thank your for your support and understanding
    in relation to the recent service interruption. We are dreadfully sorry that any
    of our members were affected by the Planet outage and felt that the least we could
    do was to keep our members informed. <BR/><BR/>All the best!
