  html: 100% correct.   There is an inherent conflict between the hierarchy which
    keeps routing tables small and every endpoint having its own unique prefix which
    can move to another attachment point (i.e. ISP) in the Internet and thus require
    routing information.<BR/><BR/>The problem is that we really don't know how to
    scale the Internet if truly every endpoint was unique and non-hierarchical.  Today's
    250,000 routes are thankfully far less than the hundreds of millions of organizations
    connected to the Internet, and it is because of the requirement to use ISP address
    space that these millions of organizations don't have their own routes in the
    global routing table.<BR/><BR/>Ergo, some hierarchy is absolutely necessary for
    a large proportion of the address space, independent of the IPv4 / IPv6 question.<BR/><BR/>/John

  html: Ivan<BR/><BR/>I don't think he said what you thought he said.<BR/><BR/>In
    the comments section he clearly agrees that IPv6 could make things a lot worse
    in terms of the size of the global routing table, and that IPv6 won't fix it.<BR/><BR/>We
    all, already know, its multi-homing thats causing it, although from what I have
    read, there are quite a few extremely lazy ISP's around the place not doing the
    correct thing and properly summarizing their networks.<BR/><BR/>P.S. On another
    note, do we really need an 8 character captcha code to stop spammers? 4 ought
    to be enough, and if it isn't, I doubt 4 more is going to make much of a difference.

  html: 'Whisper,<BR/><BR/>you''re right, he changed his perspective slightly in the
    "comments" section. But neither Michael nor Jeff Doyle (who wrote one of the last
    comments) acknowledge the fact that the routing table size is protocol-agnostic.
    It doesn''t matter whether we have IPv4 or IPv6, the size of the routing tables
    depends primarily on the number of PA+PI address blocks allocated, not on the
    address length.<BR/><BR/>Sometimes I''m disappointed to see that very knowledgeable
    and bright people use wrong arguments to promote IPv6. That''s not needed and
    it only brings confusion and generates more potential for further arguments.<BR/><BR/>As
    for the CAPTCHA code: my blog is still hosted on Blogger and the chance that Google
    engineers would ever respond to my requests is so close to zero that I don''t
    waste my time trying (just read my post about the last poll failure). What I do
    is to use my Google account (which I have for a variety of reasons) and then I
    don''t have to enter the CAPTCHA code.'

  html: Take a look at LISP (no, not the language) - http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-farinacci-lisp-07
    and http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac123/ac147/archived_issues/ipj_11-1/111_lisp.html
    should give a flavor.

  html: Ivan,<BR/><BR/>I belive this "fragmentation" issue has been recognized for
    years, and there were some proposals aimed to combat the problems with PIs and
    multihoming. Probably most well-known (to me) "hack" is BGPDNS:<BR/><BR/>http://www.ripe.net/ripe/meetings/ripe-41/presentations/routing-opperman/sld001.html<BR/><BR/>However,
    from the architectural standpoint, the root cause lies in the *global* address
    space concept used by both IPv4 and IPv6. <BR/><BR/>Just as a reference, I'm providing
    a couple of links to a new Internet routing and addressing architecure, suggested
    by a DARPA funded research project:<BR/><BR/>http://www.isi.edu/newarch/fara.html<BR/>http://www.isi.edu/newarch/DOCUMENTS/yang.nira.ps<BR/><BR/>Though
    I'm almost sure you head about it, still I hope the links will provide useful
    information to your blog readers.<BR/><BR/>Thanks for bloggig this,<BR/><BR/>--<BR/><BR/>Petr

  html: '@Petr: the BGPDNS system does not work well with current browsers. The browser
    vendors had to implement <A HREF="http://christ1an.blogspot.com/2007/07/dns-pinning-explained.html"
    REL="nofollow">DNS pinning</A> to prevent some of the more obvious spoofing attack,
    which means that you have to restart the browser session if the server you work
    with goes down.<BR/><BR/>Other than that, we did quite a few production-grade
    implementations of that concept years ago (using creative NAT) and I''m also describing
    something similar in the <A HREF="http://www.nil.com/ipcorner/SOHO_Servers/" REL="nofollow">Servers
    in SOHO multihoming</A> article.<BR/><BR/>@Petr & Roland: thanks for all the other
    links. It will take a while for me to absorb them completely :)'
