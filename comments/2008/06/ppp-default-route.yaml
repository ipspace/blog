  html: PPPoA uses the dialer interface like PPPoE or ISDN, so the interface name
    is configured by the operator.

  html: But my operator thinking I'm using ATMoUSB :)<BR/>They don't have access to
    my Cisco box. I put virtual-template into pvc definition and it works.

  html: When using &quot;ppp ipcp route default&quot; you can&#39;t change the default
    metric of 0. So you can&#39;t make a PPP session a backup default route. It&#39;s
    good for PPP as your only or primary external default connection.
