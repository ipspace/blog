  html: Yes, the old configuration would work, but the new one is more explicit. <BR/><BR/>The
    difference obviously only makes sense if you use more than just the IPv4 address
    family.

  html: Suppose you have accidentally entered explicit address-family mode and want
    to return to your old BGP config?  Do you know a hitless way to do that, or in
    your experience do you have to blow the BGP config away and start over?  Thanks
