Before, you were \"yeah, that guy that keeps the cool ioshints blog and oh btw works for NIL\"<BR/><BR/>Now it's \"the NIL wiki on a bunch of stuff and also Cisco content\"<BR/><BR/>I think you actually devaluated the whole deal - before you could throw in some NIL advertising which was related to Cisco stuff.<BR/><BR/>Now we Cisco users would need to wade thru stuff to get to the Cisco content we used to come here for.<BR/><BR/>So . . . was it a good idea?",
