  html: Is that a good idea? Before, you were "yeah, that guy that keeps the cool
    ioshints blog and oh btw works for NIL"<BR/><BR/>Now it's "the NIL wiki on a bunch
    of stuff and also Cisco content"<BR/><BR/>I think you actually devaluated the
    whole deal - before you could throw in some NIL advertising which was related
    to Cisco stuff.<BR/><BR/>Now we Cisco users would need to wade thru stuff to get
    to the Cisco content we used to come here for.<BR/><BR/>So . . . was it a good
    idea?

  html: If you would have taken the time to go through the <A HREF="http://wiki.nil.com"
    REL="nofollow">actual content of the Wiki</A>, you would notice that it currently
    contains solely Cisco-related articles. If you complained a few months after the
    change when Wiki got polluted with Microsoft Office installation guidelines (which
    will not happen, as you would be able to discover if you would have checked the
    <A HREF="http://www.nil.com/C1257455003A036D/html/ccie_experts" REL="nofollow">list
    of engineers</A> I've quoted in the post), you would have a point.<BR/><BR/>But
    rest assured, whatever happens, the value-for-price will still stay infinite (based
    on how much anonymous readers pay go get this content :).

  html: I guess I should now throw a tantrum, and swear I would never read your blog
    again ? :)<BR/><BR/>Ivan, it saddens me that you decided to be condescending:<BR/><BR/>"But
    rest assured, whatever happens, the value-for-price will still stay infinite (based
    on how much anonymous readers pay go get this content"<BR/><BR/>I used to drop
    by and read your post - YOUR posts - but then now I show up and I have to skip
    thru posts I care about . . . nothing about.<BR/><BR/>But hey, your blog, your
    rules. Might want to run yet-another-poll in a couple months to see how your fan
    base liked the change ;)

  html: To start with, I was not condescending ... I was in a completely different
    mood :))<BR/><BR/>No matter what, the blog will stay as it is (and I might elaborate
    a bit more about the whats and whys). If you'd like to continue the discussion
    (and I have nothing against a lively exchange of ideas), send me an e-mail (click
    on the "About the author" link in the top menu bar and follow the link "Send a
    message to Ivan").
