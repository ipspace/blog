            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<BR/><BR/>I just want to thank your for your support and understanding in relation to the recent service interruption. We are dreadfully sorry that any of our members were affected by the Planet outage and felt that the least we could do was to keep our members informed. <BR/><BR/>All the best!</div>
