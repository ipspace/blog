  html: Hi Ivan,<BR/><BR/>Thank you for the post. Is MLS still used today. I was under
    the impression that newer CEF demand based mechanism replaced MLS specifically
    on platforms like the 6500 and the 7600. Thanks

  html: I learnt from your nice document that SUP2 doesn&#39;t support MLS and uses
    another form of protocl &quot;IP Unicast Layer 3 Switching &quot;. But what about
    SUP 2T. Does SuP-2T also not support MLS ?

  html: Hi,<br /><br /> <br />I found that Sup2 is now end of sale and also going
    to be end of support in feb, 2012. It was replaces by SUP 720. But according to
    cisco some version of sup 720 are also being replaced by sup720 xl and also by
    supervisor engine sup 2T.<br /> <br /><br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps5718/ps708/prod_end-of-life_notice0900aecd80423d31.html<br
