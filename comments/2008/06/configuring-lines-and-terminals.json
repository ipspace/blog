      "html": "It is handy to have domain lookup feature but annoying to wait for the domain lookup for the wrong command. The fix is simple, change the transport preference to none in the vty/console line. The drawback, you wil have to use a specific telnet/ssh command infront before typing the ip address if you want to connect to another device. (eg. &quot;telnet w.x.y.z&quot; instead of simply typing &quot;w.x.y.z&quot; to login to another device).<br /><br />!<br />ip domain-lookup<br />ip name-server w.x.y.z<br />!<br />line vty 0 15<br /> transport prefer none<br /> logging synchronous<br />!<br />line con 0<br /> transport prefer none<br /> logging synchronous<br />!",
