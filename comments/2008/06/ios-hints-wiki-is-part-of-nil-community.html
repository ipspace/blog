            <div class="comment-content">Is that a good idea? Before, you were "yeah, that guy that keeps the cool ioshints blog and oh btw works for NIL"<BR/><BR/>Now it's "the NIL wiki on a bunch of stuff and also Cisco content"<BR/><BR/>I think you actually devaluated the whole deal - before you could throw in some NIL advertising which was related to Cisco stuff.<BR/><BR/>Now we Cisco users would need to wade thru stuff to get to the Cisco content we used to come here for.<BR/><BR/>So . . . was it a good idea?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">If you would have taken the time to go through the <A HREF="http://wiki.nil.com" REL="nofollow">actual content of the Wiki</A>, you would notice that it currently contains solely Cisco-related articles. If you complained a few months after the change when Wiki got polluted with Microsoft Office installation guidelines (which will not happen, as you would be able to discover if you would have checked the <A HREF="http://www.nil.com/C1257455003A036D/html/ccie_experts" REL="nofollow">list of engineers</A> I've quoted in the post), you would have a point.<BR/><BR/>But rest assured, whatever happens, the value-for-price will still stay infinite (based on how much anonymous readers pay go get this content :).</div>

Might want to run yet-another-poll in a couple months to see how your fan base liked the change ;)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">To start with, I was not condescending ... I was in a completely different mood :))<BR/><BR/>No matter what, the blog will stay as it is (and I might elaborate a bit more about the whats and whys). If you'd like to continue the discussion (and I have nothing against a lively exchange of ideas), send me an e-mail (click on the "About the author" link in the top menu bar and follow the link "Send a message to Ivan").</div>
