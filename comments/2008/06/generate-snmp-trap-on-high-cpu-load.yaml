  html: The following (if supported by your IOS) should accomplish the same thing,
    without using EEM:<BR/><BR/>process cpu threshold type total rising 30 interval
    10 falling 20 interval 10<BR/>snmp-server enable traps cpu threshold

  html: 'For granularity you can use cisco SNMP mibs for cpu utilization. Below is
    a sample I used to disable wccp when it caused a CPU surge:<BR/><BR/>event manager
    applet disable_wccp <BR/>! --- 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1.1.4.1 gives the cpu utilization
    using 1 min interval <BR/>! --- trigger event when cpu utilization hits 75% and
    starts monitoring (re-arms) again when it drops below 40% <BR/>! --- SNMP polling
    interval is set to 60 secs <BR/>event snmp oid 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1.1.4.1
    get-type exact entry-op ge entry-val 75 exit-op le exit-val 40 poll-interval 60
    <BR/>! --- logs a message <BR/>action 101 syslog priority notifications msg "Disabling
    WCCP due to prolonged CPU spikes." <BR/>! --- disable wccp globally, this is static
    - you have to know the wccp svc id <BR/>action 102 cli command "enable" <BR/>action
    103 cli command "config t" <BR/>action 104 cli command "no ip wccp 91" <BR/>action
    105 cli command "end" <BR/><BR/>In case you want to wrap things up with an event
    notification, append the following to the above disable_wccp applet: <BR/><BR/>action
    106 cli command "enable" <BR/>action 107 cli command "terminal length 0" <BR/>action
    108 cli command "show process cpu sorted" <BR/>action 109 mail server "192.168.1.254"
    to "engineer@xyz.com" from "devtest@cust_a.com" subject "Prolonged CPU Spikes"
    body "$_cli_result" <BR/><BR/><BR/>And here''s the reverse applet to re-enable
    wccp when the cpu utilization is back to normal:<BR/><BR/><BR/>event manager applet
    enable_wccp <BR/>! --- 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1.1.4.1 gives the cpu utilization
    using 1 min interval <BR/>! --- trigger event when cpu utilization is 40% and
    starts monitoring (re-arms) again when it rises to 75% <BR/>! --- SNMP polling
    interval is set to 60 secs <BR/>event snmp oid 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1.1.4.1
    get-type exact entry-op le entry-val 40 exit-op ge exit-val 75 poll-interval 60
    <BR/>! --- logs a message <BR/>action 101 syslog priority notifications msg "Enabling
    back WCCP as CPU surges no longer exist." <BR/>! --- re-enable wccp globally,
    this is static - you have to know the wccp svc id and redirect-list <BR/>action
    102 cli command "enable" <BR/>action 103 cli command "config t" <BR/>action 104
    cli command "ip wccp 91 redirect-list 101" <BR/>action 105 cli command "end"'
