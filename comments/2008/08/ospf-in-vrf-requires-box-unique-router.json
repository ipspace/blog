The only reason why you'd want one is the stability of the router ID ... which, BTW, is a moot issue if you have a single site connected to the VRF :)<BR/><BR/>If the interface is not part of a VRF, it will never be used as the OSPF router ID (only interfaces within the VRF are considered when selecting the router ID), but you can manually configure any IP address as the router ID.",

      "html": "Hi, inevitable. You've mixed two independent operations in the same sentence :)<br /><br />Step 1: The candidate interface for OSPF RID is selected from all the applicable interfaces. In the OSPF-in-VRF case, the applicable interfaces are the VRF interfaces. Loopbacks are preferred. Among interfaces with the same preference, the one with the highest IP address is used (I need to turn this into a post :).<br /><br />Step 2: the selected IP address is used as OSPF RID. The OSPF RID has to be unique among all OSPF RIDs running on the same box (even if they are in different VRFs) ... which might not be the case if two VRFs have a loopback interface with the same IP address.",
