            <div class="comment-content">I have a few pet peeves with MPLS on Cisco devices.<BR/><BR/>1. From my experience with the RSVP-TE side of signaling, you find that by default IOS advertises explicit null (label 0).  This is fine and dandy if you run an all Cisco network, because a next-to-last hop (penultimate hop) Cisco will do PHP, no matter what the ultimate hop signals to it.  But if you now throw in a Juniper as the penultimate hop with a Cisco terminating the tunnel (again signling a label of 0) to the penultimate hop, Junos does the right thing and assumes that you really want UHP.  Now you've broken PHP.  To address this, Cisco introduced "mpls traffic-eng signaling advertise implicit-null."  This will cause the IOS tail-end to signal label 3 to the PHP Juniper and Junos also correctly interprets this as PHP.<BR/><BR/>2. Some mainstream trains of IOS still require tag-switching ip to work at all.<BR/><BR/>3. Most Cisco documentation states that you must enable LDP before doing MPLS-TE, which is a complete fallacy, probably related to confusion with #2 above; though, that is pure speculation.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">There is a very good reason you need to run LDP across MPLS TE tunnel. Will write a post on it.</div>
