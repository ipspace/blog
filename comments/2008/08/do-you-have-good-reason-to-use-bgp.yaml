  html: I have a few...<BR/><BR/>1) BGP will advertise the aggregate only when it
    has component routes. this means that it will advertise the aggregate until his
    last component route is lost. the component routes can also be specificaly defined
    with the "advertise-map" keyword. All of these make it a really helpful feature
    in many cases - i can mention a few if you would like...<BR/><BR/>2) It provides
    an easy way of suppressing prefixes <BR/><BR/>3)Its inheritance capabilites (aggregate
    from its commponents) can also be quite helpful. mainly, the way you can control
    this inheritance.

  html: aggregate is a bad idea as you answer in the previous post but you can use
    only static route with a tag that go into BGP with redistribute static that match
    the tag and add a community.<BR/>another idea is to set the next hop of the route
    to an address that route to Null in all the network so address that is not in
    use will be discard in the edge of the network and will not get to the route originator.<BR/><BR/>Nitzan

  html: Ofer,<BR/><BR/>the guy is asking to share our opinion with him. The quotes
    that you show - You can be sure that he knows that (Or even possible is that you
    quote his publications :))<BR/><BR/>Anyway, in my opinion I've never used this
    feature for my humble experience period (~7 years). I'm working in a service provider
    and most of our customers have PI addresses. Other just using network command
    because they've never heard about aggregation feature. Anyway I found it as a
    good feature which nobody use (because everyone use network statement instead)
    Just like ORF (Outbound Route Filtering) - nobody use it everyone is prefer to
    use Prefix-list in conjunction with route-maps.<BR/><BR/>Kind Regards,<BR/>Danail

  html: Danail,<BR/><BR/>I am not quoting anyone but myself (if i would, i would give
    reference).I just pointed out aspects of BGP aggregate that i think are providing
    an added value.<BR/><BR/><BR/>as for a simple example:<BR/> <BR/>Let's say we
    have 2 routers. one (R1) located at the HQ , and the other (R2) located in a DRP
    site  a couple of miles away.<BR/>The two sites (Main and DRP) are connected directly
    (not through the internet!), and are running IBGP.<BR/><BR/>normally,  traffic
    should flow only over the Main site's link to the ISP (i am refering only to inbound
    traffic), so we will advertise the more specidic routes there.<BR/>We got 4 C
    Classes from the ISP (PI).<BR/><BR/>configuring 4 "nework" statements (for each
    C Class network)  at the main site , and  "aggregate-address X.X.X.X 255.255.252.0"
    at the DRP site would be an easy way of implementing this requierment.<BR/><BR/><BR/>of
    course, you could configure a static route to null0 and advertise it using a "network"
    statement, but then you will have to filter the more specific routes. anyway,
    (as far as i can think of) BGP aggregate will be much more elegant.

  html: More specifically, the aggregate statement will advertise the aggregate when
    "component" (aka contributing) routes are present in BGP.  "Network," on the other
    hand, will take contributing routes from any protocol.  Suppressing more specifics
    with the use of summary-only, is also desirable for many.  The  scenario can be
    when you provide transit for acquisitions (that could be private or public AS'es)
    which occupy a fraction of your aggregate space and you wish to suppress them.  There
    is no one size fits all here.  The point is the knob is there for a reason and
    plenty of folks have use for it.
