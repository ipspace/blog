  html: How on earth can it find the cable length?! That's clever!

  html: 'The underlying theory is simple:  an electric pulse travels along the cable
    with pretty well-known speed. Furthermore, when a pulse arrives at the end of
    an unterminated cable (or a cable break) it''s bounced back due to impedance mismatch
    (this is "slightly" oversimplified explanation, but not further from the truth
    than the flat-earth theory was in middle ages :).<BR/><BR/>The switch (actually
    part of the NIC hardware) sends a pulse into the cable and measures when the pulse
    returns. Calculating distance based on measured travel time and (known) propagation
    speed in cable is trivial.'
