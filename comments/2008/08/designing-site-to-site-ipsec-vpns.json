      "html": "Ivan:<BR/><BR/>I recently finished a year-long project on evaluating and testing GETVPN, and in your article on page 2, the term Dynamic Group VPN (DGVPN) was actually the name Cisco used internally before GETVPN was officially launched in Dec. 2006. Therefore, GETVPN is actualy DGVPN. Unless this is something totally new just popped up from Cisco, I think Mr. Sustar can consider making a reference the term DGVPN is now formally known as GETVPN to avoid confusion.<BR/><BR/>- William",

      "html": "William, <BR/>you are correct in stating the status with official feature naming. I mistakenly used the acronym DGVPN to represent multipoint GRE tunnels (like DMVPN) using GETVPN underneath. This solution actually does not have an official name; a configuration guide on the CCO uses a rather long but descriptive (though not entirely correct) name \"Implementing Group Domain of Interpretation in a Dynamic Multipoint VPN\". I will correct the article accordingly.<BR/><BR/>Thanks, Bostjan",
