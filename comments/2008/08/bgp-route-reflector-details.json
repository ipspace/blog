         "html": "Hi Ivan, <BR/><BR/>Referering to this article \"http://wiki.nil.com/BGP_route_reflectors\" can you please confirm if this statement that has been specified in the \"Route Reflector Rules Section\" is actually true.<BR/><BR/>\"An IBGP route received from a route-reflector client is sent to all IBGP peers, <B>including the client from which it was received</B>.\"<BR/><BR/>I tried researching this a bit as I was curious and no other discussion has explicitly stated that the route is reflected back to the client from which it was received. Infact this would actually go against the split horizon rule. The RFC doesn't mention of this either (Atleast I couldn't find it in the RFC:-) <BR/><BR/>Please could you confirm. Thx for help.",
