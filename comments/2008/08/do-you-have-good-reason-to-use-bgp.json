The quotes that you show - You can be sure that he knows that (Or even possible is that you quote his publications :))<BR/><BR/>Anyway, in my opinion I've never used this feature for my humble experience period (~7 years). I'm working in a service provider and most of our customers have PI addresses. Other just using network command because they've never heard about aggregation feature. Anyway I found it as a good feature which nobody use (because everyone use network statement instead) Just like ORF (Outbound Route Filtering) - nobody use it everyone is prefer to use Prefix-list in conjunction with route-maps.<BR/><BR/>Kind Regards,<BR/>Danail Petrov",

      "html": "Danail,<BR/><BR/>I am not quoting anyone but myself (if i would, i would give reference).I just pointed out aspects of BGP aggregate that i think are providing an added value.<BR/><BR/><BR/>as for a simple example:<BR/> <BR/>Let's say we have 2 routers. one (R1) located at the HQ , and the other (R2) located in a DRP site  a couple of miles away.<BR/>The two sites (Main and DRP) are connected directly (not through the internet!), and are running IBGP.<BR/><BR/>normally,  traffic should flow only over the Main site's link to the ISP (i am refering only to inbound traffic), so we will advertise the more specidic routes there.<BR/>We got 4 C Classes from the ISP (PI).<BR/><BR/>configuring 4 \"nework\" statements (for each C Class network)  at the main site , and  \"aggregate-address X.X.X.X 255.255.252.0\" at the DRP site would be an easy way of implementing this requierment.<BR/><BR/><BR/>of course, you could configure a static route to null0 and advertise it using a \"network\" statement, but then you will have to filter the more specific routes. anyway, (as far as i can think of) BGP aggregate will be much more elegant.",

      "html": "More specifically, the aggregate statement will advertise the aggregate when \"component\" (aka contributing) routes are present in BGP.  \"Network,\" on the other hand, will take contributing routes from any protocol.  Suppressing more specifics with the use of summary-only, is also desirable for many.  The  scenario can be when you provide transit for acquisitions (that could be private or public AS'es) which occupy a fraction of your aggregate space and you wish to suppress them.  There is no one size fits all here.  The point is the knob is there for a reason and plenty of folks have use for it.",
