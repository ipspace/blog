  html: 'I have a few pet peeves with MPLS on Cisco devices.<BR/><BR/>1. From my experience
    with the RSVP-TE side of signaling, you find that by default IOS advertises explicit
    null (label 0).  This is fine and dandy if you run an all Cisco network, because
    a next-to-last hop (penultimate hop) Cisco will do PHP, no matter what the ultimate
    hop signals to it.  But if you now throw in a Juniper as the penultimate hop with
    a Cisco terminating the tunnel (again signling a label of 0) to the penultimate
    hop, Junos does the right thing and assumes that you really want UHP.  Now you''ve
    broken PHP.  To address this, Cisco introduced "mpls traffic-eng signaling advertise
    implicit-null."  This will cause the IOS tail-end to signal label 3 to the PHP
    Juniper and Junos also correctly interprets this as PHP.<BR/><BR/>2. Some mainstream
    trains of IOS still require tag-switching ip to work at all.<BR/><BR/>3. Most
    Cisco documentation states that you must enable LDP before doing MPLS-TE, which
    is a complete fallacy, probably related to confusion with #2 above; though, that
    is pure speculation.'

  html: There is a very good reason you need to run LDP across MPLS TE tunnel. Will
    write a post on it.
