  html: I might be wrong, but you need to configure a loopback interface for each
    VRF. Is not it?<BR/><BR/>If a loopback interface is not a part of VRF; Is it correct
    we can configure that interface for VRF ospf process.

  html: You don't need a loopback interface for a VRF. The only reason why you'd want
    one is the stability of the router ID ... which, BTW, is a moot issue if you have
    a single site connected to the VRF :)<BR/><BR/>If the interface is not part of
    a VRF, it will never be used as the OSPF router ID (only interfaces within the
    VRF are considered when selecting the router ID), but you can manually configure
    any IP address as the router ID.

  html: Hi Ivan , to get accurate statement and correct me if iam wrong , OSPF RID
    is selected from VRF interfaces except for Loopback which must be box unique even
    if its VRF interface

  html: 'Hi, inevitable. You''ve mixed two independent operations in the same sentence
    :)<br /><br />Step 1: The candidate interface for OSPF RID is selected from all
    the applicable interfaces. In the OSPF-in-VRF case, the applicable interfaces
    are the VRF interfaces. Loopbacks are preferred. Among interfaces with the same
    preference, the one with the highest IP address is used (I need to turn this into
    a post :).<br /><br />Step 2: the selected IP address is used as OSPF RID. The
    OSPF RID has to be unique among all OSPF RIDs running on the same box (even if
    they are in different VRFs) ... which might not be the case if two VRFs have a
    loopback interface with the same IP address.'
