  html: Ivan,<BR/><BR/>That long DMVPN post was actually an intro ;) The problem with
    DMVPN is that Cisco has shallow explanation of NHRP functionality and reading
    the RFC is such a pain for many people.<BR/><BR/>I'm still working on "advanced"
    DMVPN scenario (daisy-chained hubs) and DMVPN Phase 3 - which is yet another conceptual
    solution. Hope to make the new posts less than 50 pages long, for I need to write
    more on QoS/MSTP.<BR/><BR/><BR/>Petr<BR/><BR/>PS<BR/>next VPN thing to come is
    probably GET, with that fascinating ISAKMP GDOI stuff ;)
