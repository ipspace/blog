            <div class="comment-content">Great article. The CCIE is not devalued IMHO. The amount of work, dedication, preparation, time and money as well as other resources to obtain this certification is very high. I agree there are brain dumps for both the written and labs (I heard there are courses in China that you sit for a month for the price of USD 10,000.00 and that will guarantee you a CCIE certification) but all those will not be relevant in the real world. Would we employ a CCIE who only knows questions 1,2,3 on the dumps and not how to actually solve them? The answer is obvious :-)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I'm just starting my CCIE journey and this is a great post. IMHO, braindumps at the CCIE level are totally irrelevant. Like nickelby said, in an interview it will become quickly apparent who the prepared and experienced CCIE's are.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Okay, I'll admit it.  I 'braindumped' my first practical exam...my driver's test.  I got the blueprint and made sure I knew all the scenarios.  I talked to people who had taken the test and knew what the 'gotchas' were.  And then I cheated by going out in a car and practiced parallel parking and parking on a hill until I felt comfortable and knew I could do it right.  Then I went in and passed.  When the time came to parallel park, I was nervous because I wasn't parking between a blue car and a red truck like I practiced, but I knew the basic procedure, so I felt I could do it.<BR/><BR/>When you put it into that kind of context, it does sound kind of silly, but the basic premise is the same.  If you have the blueprint for the exam and you practice all the combinations of things you might see, then you should know the material well enough to pass.  Even if you don't get the blue car/red truck in your lab exam.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I agree with your comments. Reese puts SOME useful info together, but quite often the speculation is rampant and clearly designed as "poke Cisco in the eye" fodder. Not sure what the point is with that. <BR/><BR/>The funny thing is that I think the guy actually has an idea of what us CCIE "Suckers" go through to get there.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The CCIE certification is less mysterious now that bloggers and training vendors have made mastery of the required material accessible.  It is possible with little "real world" experience to earn the CCIE designation.<BR/><BR/>When you get down to it, that's all the griping is really about.  Holding the CCIE title doesn't mean quite what it used to, because it's easier to get at.  There's not as much pride in being a CCIE, because there's a decent chance that you work alongside someone with their own digits.<BR/><BR/>Does that mean the CCIE is devalued?  Only if demand for CCIE talent is flat.  My understanding from the various recruiters that contact me is that demand for CCIEs still exceeds the number of CCIEs available.  The six-figure base salaries back that up.<BR/><BR/>I sorely wish we had another CCIE in-house.  I could keep him as busy as I am myself.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&gt; bloggers and training vendors have made mastery of the required material accessible<br /><br />While the CCIE was veiled in mystery and mystique it was sexy and daring and thought of as unattainable. Now that people have a better idea of what&#39;s involved it&#39;s reminiscent of sitting at your local $sport and armchair commenting &quot;I could probably do that&quot; but never committing to actually doing it. Thinking a CCIE was a modern day Network MacGyver and not just some guy who spent an extraordinary amount of time studying has taken a bit of the shine off the certificate but I don&#39;t see copious amounts of people commiting the time doing the certificate. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">IMHO CCIE isn't what it used to be. Most people passing the lab nowadays are non-experts. And you can easily find people with 2 or more CCIE designations at your work place. Double CCIEs were a rare commodity during the golden years.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ok- <BR/><BR/>Where do you work that you think double CCIE's are...  common.  <BR/><BR/>They are not that common.<BR/><BR/>A double CCIE is Security/Voice in my town in Orlando is being sought for between $150-200k per year.<BR/><BR/>Send those doubles the news.<BR/><BR/>I just took a call from another recruiter for another CCIE Job in a neighboring city. <BR/><BR/>I just intereviewed for two CCIE-Level positions this past month or two.<BR/><BR/>I was considered for 2 others after I had already accepted a position.<BR/><BR/>No - I have to say that CCIE's are in demand.<BR/><BR/>Those who think the knowledge is being saturated probably have not yet taken the time to get sit and take the CCIE Lab yet.<BR/><BR/>It's just not quite as easy as people make it out to be. <BR/><BR/>Not that anyone who ever passed ever called it "easy" in the first place.<BR/><BR/>Don't think I right.  Find me and contact me, I'll throw a few scenarios at you that I've found interesting over the years, let's see if you think they are easy.<BR/><BR/>Better yet go to a CCIE Training company and fork over a few dollars $100-250 for a graded exam and see how you fare.  <BR/><BR/>Now if it is that easy you'll pass with flying covers.  <BR/><BR/>I've known people who take those exams and could not tell how many devices were in the lab.<BR/><BR/>...  It's not quite as easy as it looks.  Trust me from friend.<BR/><BR/>The Value of the CCIE is still the best around.<BR/><BR/>Now many people passing today have had the benefit of a decade of vendors who only made higher quality products and the blogs and wiki's are a higher quality than was ever seen back in the day.<BR/><BR/>The CCIE's of yesteryear did not have as much detail to worry with that today's CCIE's do.  Granted thay had more technologies in some respects and they had to actually come up with an ip schmeme and even cabling their own rack.<BR/><BR/>Today's CCIE's have some of the fiercest scenarios that really tax the technology.<BR/><BR/>Don't believe me...  I've got the CCIE Bootcamp from ECP1 and ECP2 from over 10 years ago.<BR/><BR/>I've been to the bootcamps for NMC-1 and NMC-2 today.<BR/><BR/>Similar material.  Similar technologies.<BR/><BR/>However, A well-prepared CCNA can do well on the labs from ECP1/ECP2 in a modern context.<BR/><BR/>A well-prepared CCIE Candidate can choke easily on NMC-1/NMC-2 or any of their CheckIT Labs.<BR/><BR/>It's true.<BR/><BR/>The level of difficulty is enourmous compared to that required in the past when VLSM was classful/classless routing was the challenging topic of the day and split-horizon was a one of the nastier beasts seen in a lab.<BR/><BR/>The IOS is more feature-rich today.  <BR/><BR/><BR/>Starting to get the picture?</div>
