In the below example, the EEM script runs and the syslog msg (action 10) gets generated, but the route doesn&#39;t get put in.  It seems like the syslog can be written, but the CLI can not.  I&#39;ve tried inserting &#39;wait&#39; actions between 10 and 20 with sometimes successful results.  Is there a better syslog message or another way to trigger the eem execution as soon as the CLI is available for EEM?  This is the same case using the &#39;SYS-5-RESTART&#39; trigger Ivan demonstrated.  If it makes any difference, this is on the 4500E platform - we have triggered off of SSO being reached, but that is too late for what we are trying to do.<br /><br />Thanks for any input<br /><br />event manager applet eemscript authorization bypass<br /> description This applet executes a CLI command after a switch reboot.<br /> event timer cron cron-entry &quot;@reboot&quot; maxrun 100<br /> action 10 syslog msg &quot;EEM script has started.&quot;<br /> action 20 cli command &quot;enable&quot;<br /> action 30 cli command &quot;configure terminal&quot;<br /> action 40 cli command &quot;ip route (network) (mask)&quot;<br />",
