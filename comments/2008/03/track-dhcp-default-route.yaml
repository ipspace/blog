    html: 'I just experienced the same with a Cisco 1900 with IOS 15.3.3M1. When the
      router would boot up the default gateway would either not be set or set to 0.0.0.0. '

  html: Ivan:<BR/>We've run across what seems an odd anomaly. When configuring an
    interface address as DHCP, the address, mask, and DNS options operate correctly
    but the route table updates only after the initial zero crossing of the 'next
    timer fires after' value. Occasionally, this timer starts at values of more than
    30 minutes.<BR/><BR/>Have you seen this situation?

  html: Looks like a bug to me. Try your luck with bug navigator, maybe you'll get
    a hit; otherwise you should open a case with Cisco TAC.

  html: it seems that the track option can&#39;t be configured when configuring a
    static route for a DHCP next hop. i.e. can&#39;t do &quot;ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
    fas0/1 dhcp track 123&quot;. Using a 2811 with IOS 12.4.11 advancedIP... does
    it exist in any IOS?

  html: I fought this trying to use a static route. I got it working with a floating
    route in the interface.<br /><br />interface FastEthernet0<br />ip dhcp client
    route track 101<br />ip address dhcp client-id FastEthernet0<br />ip virtual-reassembly<br
    />....<br /><br />interface FastEthernet1<br />ip dhcp client route track 102<br
    />ip address dhcp client-id FastEthernet1<br />ip virtual-reassembly<br />....

  html: To setup the route for tracking with dhcp use this:<br /><br />conf t<br />int
    fastethernet 0<br />ip dhcp client route track 101<br />...<br />int fastethernet
    1<br />ip dhcp client route track 102<br />...
