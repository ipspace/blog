  html: Are there ISPs today still have link's MTU set to something like 512 bytes?<BR/><BR/>I
    remember back in the mid to late 90's ISPs were very common to have link's MTU
    less than 1000 bytes (remember the famous Windows Dialup MTU tweaks?). Nowadays
    I believe most backhual links' MTUs  are at least 4096 bytes within the ISPs themselves.
    <BR/><BR/>I wonder if the industry especially the router vendors should increase
    the default physical serial interface's MTU from the default of 1500 bytes to
    somthing like 2048 bytes going forward? I realize there could be potential memory
    issues for buffers, etc.; but for the time being 2048 bytes should be perfect
    to accommodate a single 1500-byte packet + IPSec + GRE header w/o fragmentation.

  html: There&#39;s a major problem?  Let&#39;s say you have a link with a backup
    GRE tunnel.  Link is 1500 bytes so MTU is 1500.  Then there is a link failure.  Traffic
    now goes over the backup GRE tunnel.  However, now the MTU is smaller.  The hosts
    have already done Path MTU Discovery at 1500, so now all traffic will necessarily
    drop over the backup link, since the router can no longer fragment.

  html: This is not how PMTUD works. It&#39;s a continuous process based on incoming
    ICMP messages, not something you&#39;d do at the session establishment time (that&#39;s
    TCP MSS parameter). You&#39;ll find more details in my PMTUD article:<br /><br

    a great article about it:<br /><br />http://wiki.nil.com/Path_MTU_Discovery
