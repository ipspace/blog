  html: Hi Ivan<BR/><BR/>I can imagine you are in the unenviable position of having
    to tell the poor 1st level support person at the other end of the phone line,
    how to do their job. :)<BR/><BR/>Then by the time you get to 3rd or 4th level
    support, the person shits themselves because they realise they are talking to
    Ivan Pepelnjak, and not some idiot who doesn't know what they are doing.

  html: 'Some of you might enjoy this exchange of e-mails :) Here is the initial request.<BR/>==================<BR/>Dear
    all!<BR/><BR/>I own the ''ioshints.info'' domain and would like the CNAME ''wiki.ioshints.info''
    to be served from my Linux account ****** <BR/><BR/>However, I have two problems:<BR/><BR/>#1:
    Although I am supposed to have ** (free?) DNS aliases with the ''******'' service
    plan, the form on the control panel insists I will be billed $***/month for the
    DNS alias.<BR/><BR/>#2: the control panel also wants me to transfer the ''ioshints.info''
    domain to you, which is not what I need. I have already set up the CNAME on my
    end and all I need is the correct settings in the Apache server.<BR/><BR/>Could
    you help me, please, to get this set up?'

  html: I'm soooo glad my hosting plan is what I've expected from the marketing info.
    Now let's try to get into the technical details ...<BR/>===========================<BR/>Thanks
    for answering the "business" part of my question. Let's return to the technical
    part. Allow me to reiterate it, please:<BR/>===================================<BR/>I
    own the 'ioshints.info' domain and would like the CNAME 'wiki.ioshints.info' to
    be served from my Linux account ********.<BR/><BR/>The "control panel" (the "add
    domain alias" function") wants me to transfer the 'ioshints.info' domain to you,
    which is not what I need. I have already set up the CNAME on my end and all I
    need is the correct settings in the Apache server.<BR/>===================================<BR/>Could
    you help me, please, to get this set up?<BR/><BR/>Thanks in advance & best regards<BR/>Ivan

  html: To cut the long story short ... finally someone who understood what I'm trying
    to get stepped in and explained that they cannot do it. Time to look for an alternative
    ...
