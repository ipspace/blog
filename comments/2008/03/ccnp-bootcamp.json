I just can't understand how can a person understand the whole CCNP routing and switching level with as little as CCNA background. <BR/><BR/>People might try to justify the training expense from their office of even try to justify he/she have been in training so people can call 'em CCNP. Nope, sorry. It does not come with training. It should come with understanding.",

There is a huge gap between the CCNP and CCNA both conceptually and practically.<BR/><BR/>I was in a rush to try and get my CCNP but I think I am going to slow down to make the concepts sink in a lot more deeply.<BR/><BR/>However employers do see the letters and assume sometimes that the person is better which may not always be the case.<BR/><BR/>But this is not a new conundrum",

I partially agree with you, but it all depends (as always :) from where you're coming and where you're going.
