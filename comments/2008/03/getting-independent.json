DNS aliases with the '******' service plan, the form on the control panel insists I will be billed $***/month for the DNS alias.<BR/><BR/>#2: the control panel also wants me to transfer the 'ioshints.info' domain to you, which is not what I need. I have already set up the CNAME on my end and all I need is the correct settings in the Apache server.<BR/><BR/>Could you help me, please, to get this set up?",
