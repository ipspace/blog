      "html": "My thoughts on this was application fixup. A number of protocols (active FTP, DNS, SQLNET, RTSP and others) either embed IP addresses or do port changes, which NAT would have to detect and fixup. A quick google found this cisco doc,  http://tinyurl.com/64m9sr, which indicates that Application Level Gateways are used. It wouldn't surprise me if ALGs use NBAR to do its dirty work.",
