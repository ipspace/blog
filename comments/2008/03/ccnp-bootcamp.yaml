  html: I'm a no fan of quickie CCNP. I just can't understand how can a person understand
    the whole CCNP routing and switching level with as little as CCNA background.
    <BR/><BR/>People might try to justify the training expense from their office of
    even try to justify he/she have been in training so people can call 'em CCNP.
    Nope, sorry. It does not come with training. It should come with understanding.

  html: I agree with David in a sense. There is a huge gap between the CCNP and CCNA
    both conceptually and practically.<BR/><BR/>I was in a rush to try and get my
    CCNP but I think I am going to slow down to make the concepts sink in a lot more
    deeply.<BR/><BR/>However employers do see the letters and assume sometimes that
    the person is better which may not always be the case.<BR/><BR/>But this is not
    a new conundrum

  html: '@Whisper: thanks for the feedback. Escalated the issue.<BR/><BR/>@David+anonymous:
    thanks for your perspective. I partially agree with you, but it all depends (as
    always :) from where you''re coming and where you''re going. I''ll wait a bit
    to see if there are any more comments in this direction and then try to explain
    my views on "quick CCNP".'

  html: I personally don't look as the camps as opportunity to learn the technology
    but rather a quick way for people with industry experience to brush up on knowledge
    and to gain a certification that can make a difference with prospective employers.<BR/><BR/>It's
    one thing to reference your experience in a resume and a completely different
    one to demonstrate that you have the technical aptitude to attain a industry wide
    respected certification status.<BR/><BR/>Just my two cents.
