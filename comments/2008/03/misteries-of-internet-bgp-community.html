            <p class="comment-content">Thanks for this excellent post, Ivan; and this is definitely old school :-)<BR/><BR/>Another amazing fact is that you still keep a 10-yrs-old  presentation deck on your PC ;-) <BR/><BR/>May be 20 years later you could become a "I.T. Networking" historian.<BR/><BR/>I think I still have my Networkers presentation CD from 1995...somewhere...</p>

            <p class="comment-content">I certainly fall into the trap of "if it's on Cisco's web site it must be gospel".  I've made that mistake with books, too.  In this case, there was no reason to suspect that there weren't 4 well-known communities, and the Internet community behaves as expected in the context of lab exercises.  Such is the disadvantage of not using BGP all that often in my real-world, day-to-day existence.</p>

            <p class="comment-content">@William: that's the benefit of having ISO 9001 system that covers (among other things) course development. Of course the slides were not on my PC but in a document repository :)<BR/><BR/>@Ethan: don't worry, we all make the same mistake :) I wouldn't have spotted it if I hadn't been doing the background research for the BGP course.</p>
