IOS is a wonderful, efficient tool, and I am thankful every day for it.<BR/><BR/>However, I can think of stuff I wouldn't want to work on via terminal, VMWare ESX is one product that springs to mind. The comamndline for that is awful. VirtualBox Headless is quite well written, but I'd still prefer a GUI for managing VMs.<BR/><BR/>Horses for courses.",
