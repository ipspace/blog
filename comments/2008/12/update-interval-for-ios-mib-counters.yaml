  html: Hi Ivan,<BR/><BR/>if the QOS MIB isn't your only option, and if the administrative
    overhead won't be too high, you might consider using an EEM applet tracking the
    rxload/txload parameters on an interface. these will give you a much granular
    results.

  html: Thanks for the hint, but unfortunately I cannot do that. I need to identify
    when the real-time (for example voice) traffic starts and the only MIB variables
    I found so far are in the CBQoS MIB.

  html: There is no way of doing this AFAIK, the data comes from the same place as
    the "show policy-map interface" which is updated every 10 seconds.

  html: The "show policy-map interface" updates counters more often than every 10
    seconds (although admittedly not in real-time). Unfortunately I need an SNMP variable
    to act upon, otherwise I would just execute the "show" command and extract the
    results.

  html: the hidden command 'snmp-server hc poll 1000' is supposed to allow counters
    to be updated at 1sec<BR/><BR/>-scott

  html: Thanks, Scott! The command is accepted on a 1800 and a 7200, does not appear
    in the configuration (which I could easily fix :) and does not affect the MIB
    values :((

  html: the units are actually hundredths of a second.<br /><br />try:<br /> snmp-server
    hc poll 100<br /><br />That will have IOS update the HC counters once per second.  -WP

  html: I see the exact same behavior, did you ever find a way to increase the rate
    of updates for this data?

  html: There were a few useful suggestions (see above) that could work on specific
    platforms. I found nothing that would work well for me.

  html: I guess I could have clarified but was in a rush. Cat6509, the previous undocumentated
    config (snmp-server hc poll xxx) does not give error but also does not affect
    what you and I are after. Oh well.
