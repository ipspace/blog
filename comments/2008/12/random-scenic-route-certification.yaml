  html: Well I agree having the underlying theory is important, no doubt about that.
    But I sometimes I feel like I am reading over the material constantly and it just
    feels like superficial knowledge until I really build(possibly screw up) and repair
    the network

    html: 'As mentioned in the post the two options are: <br /><br />1) Make great
      questions<br />2) Take dubious shortcuts to make a simple question seem complex<br
      /><br />It&#39;s just a matter of not having enough time/manpower/effort to
      make complex questions. '

  html: I also thought about your response to the vagueness of the questions.<BR/><BR/>If
    the examiners think that the test may be too easy, why not ask harder questions
    as opposed to vague questions to begin with?<BR/><BR/>That seems to me to be counter
    intuitive to the process.

  html: 'hey, a fairly comprehensive dismissal of my comments :-)... and I don''t
    disagree with your thoughts.<BR/><BR/>1) Your View: make sure you gain the knowledge
    whilst getting the cert.<BR/><BR/>2) My View: You need the the Cert to get the
    job to get the knowledge. Focus on passing.<BR/><BR/>so where we disagree is in
    fact gaining the knowledge.<BR/><BR/><BR/>I suspect this plays out in Rogers comment
    whereby the knowledge is apparently superficial until you are using this knowledge
    in commercial environments where you really start to see why things were conceived
    off in the first place, which in most cases you cant get to without said Cert.<BR/><BR/>A
    kind of catch 22 if you like...<BR/><BR/>At the end of the day, for most of us
    this is a commercial endeavour and not to mention extremely competitive (Especially
    in light of a Credit Crunch and CCIE devaluation thanks to our cheaper cousins
    from China and India etc). <BR/><BR/>I just think that a persons best interest
    is getting the cert as quick as poss, then getting the job and then gaining the
    necessary experience.. I appreciate this lacks the integrity of your method but
    see comments above about competitiveness.<BR/><BR/>To summarise if I was studying
    for CCxP, specifically OSPF or MPLS VPNs and I memorised them and fully understood
    (by supplementing this with some real knowledge say Jeff Doyle OSPF Chapter and
    your very own MPLS VPN architectures where knowledge does indeed reside)<BR/><BR/>I
    bet you by the time I came to a job where I really needed to use it (re-engineering
    a CORE network perhaps or troubleshooting an MPLS VPN) I would have forgotten
    and I would need to reread both books. Only then after marrying both these books
    with the specific issue will it really get into my head.<BR/><BR/><BR/>just one
    last nitpick.. your comments are wrong regarding my "Inter-as MPLS TE" comment.
    I said "Inter-as MPLS" AND "MPLS TE". You are correct where the former must be
    rarely used, however, (for the benefits of your readers) the latter two I mentioned
    are indeed used extensively in many carrier networks. (speaking a of pet technology
    -- what to do with MTR? :-) )<BR/><BR/>I hope you take the comments in the spirit
    the are intended (brainstorming) and I always remain pragmatic :-).<BR/><BR/>perhaps
    a good topic for your blog could be "How prepared does you a cert make you for
    real life roles within our industry?"<BR/><BR/>bad designer.'
