      "html": "Hi Ivan. I was looking last night for a CCIE courses at your company, but I didn't find any bootcamp for CCIE Security. I'm planning to go on lab exam somewhere in Q4 of 2009. Do you have any plans to have bootcamp for CCIE Security somewhere after the version 3 blueprint will be on place? I will seriously consider that option, because I'm working not far away from Slovenia, and the prices for your CCIE courses are acceptable from my point of view<BR/>Thanks!",
