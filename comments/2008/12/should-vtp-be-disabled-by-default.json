At least, NOT as a server. The only acceptable default setting is TRANSPARENT.<BR/><BR/>If the default is transparent, a new (or even rogue) switch on the network doesn't overwrite other devices, nor does it adopt what it hears.  Plus, if you DO use VTP, it won't get in the way of previous operations.<BR/><BR/>As an old co-worker always said, VTP is a shining advertisement for Cisco's competitors.",

I fully agree to have VTP configured in TRANSPARENT or CLIENT mode by default (can anyone ask/get Cisco to implement it), but since we are all using the technology as it is, a few protective measures can be put in place to defend against a new (rogue) switch:<BR/>- configure a VTP domain on the network (default: NULL)<BR/>- configure the MD5 hash authentication for that domain (default: none)<BR/>- have at least one VTP server on the network (some stable, fully monitored and locked down switch - not that the others should be left open for everyone's access), while the rest of them are CLIENT or TRANSPARENT (depending on one's choice).<BR/>- shutdown VLAN1 across the board and configure another VLAN as native for the whole network.<BR/>I found the above useful to remember when building new networks or even when a call for help in the middle of the night comes from a desperate buddy...",

      "html": "We leave VTP in transparent mode for nearly all devices.  A human screw-up with VTP is potentially catastrophic.  In addition, we don't want every switch to know about every VLAN in a VTP domain for reasons of a clean configuration and improved STP topology control.  Proper, common sense defaults with VTP would go a long way to making a VTP implementation palatable.<BR/><BR/>I have a similar gripe with other defaults, one being that switch interface ports come up enabled instead of shutdown.  We've had issues where a stack member in a 3750 stack loses its mind, comes up as a new number and is issued a default configuration from the stack master, and therefore uplinks all ports to VLAN1, including interfaces that may have been part of a cross-stack etherchannel previously.  The results are ugly.  It would be better for a naked switch to boot with all interfaces in a shutdown state, waiting for a grown up to configure them.<BR/><BR/>Cisco trying to make switches \"just work\" out of the box is pandering to the wrong crowd.  Cisco switches are feature-laden and outrageously expensive.  They aren't targeted at the home market.  In that context, the defaults should be set with the expectation of networking professionals installing them in data networking environments that matter.",

I disable it on any client facing interfaces.<BR/><BR/>bpdufilter does just that, filters bpdu sends &amp; receives.<BR/>bpduguard will errdisable the port if bpdu is received on the port.<BR/>per Cisco:<BR/>To prevent loops from occurring in a network, the PortFast mode is supported only on nontrunking access ports because these ports typically do not transmit or receive BPDUs. The most secure implementation of PortFast is to enable it only on ports that connect end stations to switches. Because PortFast can be enabled on nontrunking ports connecting two switches, spanning tree loops can occur because BPDUs are still being transmitted and received on those ports.<BR/><BR/>The PortFast BPDU guard feature prevents loops by moving a nontrunking port into an errdisable state when a BPDU is received on that port. When the BPDU guard feature is enabled on the switch, spanning tree shuts down PortFast-configured interfaces that receive BPDUs, instead of putting them into the spanning tree blocking state. In a valid configuration, PortFast-configured interfaces do not receive BPDUs. If a PortFast-configured interface receives a BPDU, an invalid configuration exists, such as connection of an unauthorized device. The BPDU guard feature provides a secure response to invalid configurations because the administrator must manually put the interface back in service. <BR/>One other thing I forgot to mention... it helps to keep the network diameter in control",
