  html: This post comes at the perfect moment for me... currently working some NAT
    issues and it's very helpful. Thanks!<BR/><BR/>I couldn't agree more with you
    regarding the config of destination address translation using the "ip nat outside
    source" command. Far from intuitive!<BR/><BR/>I'm currently testing whether such
    syntax will work for sessions being initiated from the *inside*. I have a situation
    where this is not working, although it is under some very particular circumstances.

  html: Not to raise a dead topic, but I&#39;m doing a bit of research and we&#39;re
    trying to use &quot;ip nat log translation flow-export&quot; on an ASR1004.  Unfortunately,
    it looks like the netflow only contains inside-local and outside-global ... missing
    the inside-global value(s) that might be necessary to track down the NAT source
    of an abuse complaint (like Wikipedia vandalism, for one).  Anyone know if this
    is simply my configuration (and I can log that inside-global value in the netflow
    record) or if this is another IOS-XE wackiness??

  html: We are logging nat with the ip nat translations command for vrf, and we noticed
    that 8% of the logging messages are DNS.  Is there a way for us to filter DNS
    from being logged via the nat translations?

  html: You can write syslog filters in Tcl - read the Embedded Syslog Manager (ESM)
    documentation.

  html: 'Quite an old post, anyway...<br /><br />...it seems that translations logging
    is totally broken when using NVI-based NAT.<br /><br />In the logged entry, only
    the &quot;protocol&quot; field (tcp, udp, etc.) is correctly assigned: all the
    address:port fields are logged as 0.0.0.0:0 -- Tested on IOS 15.1(4)M12a.<br /><br
    />Can someone confirm this? Any known workaround?<br />'
