            <div class="comment-content">Well I agree having the underlying theory is important, no doubt about that. But I sometimes I feel like I am reading over the material constantly and it just feels like superficial knowledge until I really build(possibly screw up) and repair the network</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I also thought about your response to the vagueness of the questions.<BR/><BR/>If the examiners think that the test may be too easy, why not ask harder questions as opposed to vague questions to begin with?<BR/><BR/>That seems to me to be counter intuitive to the process.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">hey, a fairly comprehensive dismissal of my comments :-)... and I don't disagree with your thoughts.<BR/><BR/>1) Your View: make sure you gain the knowledge whilst getting the cert.<BR/><BR/>2) My View: You need the the Cert to get the job to get the knowledge. Focus on passing.<BR/><BR/>so where we disagree is in fact gaining the knowledge.<BR/><BR/><BR/>I suspect this plays out in Rogers comment whereby the knowledge is apparently superficial until you are using this knowledge in commercial environments where you really start to see why things were conceived off in the first place, which in most cases you cant get to without said Cert.<BR/><BR/>A kind of catch 22 if you like...<BR/><BR/>At the end of the day, for most of us this is a commercial endeavour and not to mention extremely competitive (Especially in light of a Credit Crunch and CCIE devaluation thanks to our cheaper cousins from China and India etc). <BR/><BR/>I just think that a persons best interest is getting the cert as quick as poss, then getting the job and then gaining the necessary experience.. I appreciate this lacks the integrity of your method but see comments above about competitiveness.<BR/><BR/>To summarise if I was studying for CCxP, specifically OSPF or MPLS VPNs and I memorised them and fully understood (by supplementing this with some real knowledge say Jeff Doyle OSPF Chapter and your very own MPLS VPN architectures where knowledge does indeed reside)<BR/><BR/>I bet you by the time I came to a job where I really needed to use it (re-engineering a CORE network perhaps or troubleshooting an MPLS VPN) I would have forgotten and I would need to reread both books. Only then after marrying both these books with the specific issue will it really get into my head.<BR/><BR/><BR/>just one last nitpick.. your comments are wrong regarding my "Inter-as MPLS TE" comment. I said "Inter-as MPLS" AND "MPLS TE". You are correct where the former must be rarely used, however, (for the benefits of your readers) the latter two I mentioned are indeed used extensively in many carrier networks. (speaking a of pet technology -- what to do with MTR? :-) )<BR/><BR/>I hope you take the comments in the spirit the are intended (brainstorming) and I always remain pragmatic :-).<BR/><BR/>perhaps a good topic for your blog could be "How prepared does you a cert make you for real life roles within our industry?"<BR/><BR/>bad designer.</div>
