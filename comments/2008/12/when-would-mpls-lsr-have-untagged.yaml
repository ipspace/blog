  html: Very good article to clarify my understanding!!<BR/><BR/>By the way, what
    would the keyword "aggregate" mean, this is another keyword I dont quite understand
    while I am checking the mpls forwarding-table.

  html: Dear Ivan, when a loopback network is advertised as let say 1.1.0.0/16, on
    the neighboring router its seen as pop tag, on local router i cant see it in sh
    mpls forwarding. If the loopback is not running mpls why router is advertising
    implicit null label for it ? why dont leave it untagged ?

  html: 'Correction...<br /><br />extract from above:<br />Summary: you would see
    the Untagged label in the LFIB when the IP prefix is a directly connected interface,
    a summary route or the next-hop router has not advertised the label.<br /><br
    />interfaces directly connected are not shown in LFIB since the router has already
    requested a POP action for them. and therez no need to look into LFIB..'

  html: Not true on LC-ATM interfaces (luckily we don&#39;t see them too often :)
    )  or on VRF interfaces.

  html: Ivan,<br /><br />summary routes are not untagged labels as well, summarized
    routes are tagged with imp-null.<br /><br />kindly elaborate ur statement regarding
    VRF interfaces...
