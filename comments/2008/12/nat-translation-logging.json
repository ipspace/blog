Thanks!<BR/><BR/>I couldn't agree more with you regarding the config of destination address translation using the \"ip nat outside source\" command. Far from intuitive!<BR/><BR/>I'm currently testing whether such syntax will work for sessions being initiated from the *inside*. I have a situation where this is not working, although it is under some very particular circumstances.",

Unfortunately, it looks like the netflow only contains inside-local and outside-global ... missing the inside-global value(s) that might be necessary to track down the NAT source of an abuse complaint (like Wikipedia vandalism, for one).  Anyone know if this is simply my configuration (and I can log that inside-global value in the netflow record) or if this is another IOS-XE wackiness??",
