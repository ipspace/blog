  html: I feel just as strongly about this as well, as does pretty much anyone with
    more than a couple of switches.  You're right that VTP should be disabled by default.  At
    least, NOT as a server. The only acceptable default setting is TRANSPARENT.<BR/><BR/>If
    the default is transparent, a new (or even rogue) switch on the network doesn't
    overwrite other devices, nor does it adopt what it hears.  Plus, if you DO use
    VTP, it won't get in the way of previous operations.<BR/><BR/>As an old co-worker
    always said, VTP is a shining advertisement for Cisco's competitors.

  html: 'I''ve been through this pain before when the VTP was "configured" (left at
    default settings) across the network and new switches would overwrite the settings
    when they were attached to the network. I fully agree to have VTP configured in
    TRANSPARENT or CLIENT mode by default (can anyone ask/get Cisco to implement it),
    but since we are all using the technology as it is, a few protective measures
    can be put in place to defend against a new (rogue) switch:<BR/>- configure a
    VTP domain on the network (default: NULL)<BR/>- configure the MD5 hash authentication
    for that domain (default: none)<BR/>- have at least one VTP server on the network
    (some stable, fully monitored and locked down switch - not that the others should
    be left open for everyone''s access), while the rest of them are CLIENT or TRANSPARENT
    (depending on one''s choice).<BR/>- shutdown VLAN1 across the board and configure
    another VLAN as native for the whole network.<BR/>I found the above useful to
    remember when building new networks or even when a call for help in the middle
    of the night comes from a desperate buddy...'

  html: Cisco switches have many poor default settings and not just VTP.  Why don't
    they sort out all of it by constructing a default config that is more secure?<BR/>However,
    I think it is a serious process flaw to add switches willy nilly into a network
    and not expect a failure.  A suitable time window needs to be negotiated with
    business, the switch needs to be prepped off network with an acceptable config
    and flashed with the relevant firware version.<BR/>I think Cisco deserves rhubarbs
    for bad defaults but they cannot be held accountable for bad process management.

  html: cat4k people said in 2007 "IOS default setting of the VTP mode is server mode,
    but when we ship from the manufacturing, we explicitly change the mode to "Transparent".
    In other words, if you delete the manufacturing default setting and reset the
    switch, the switch will come back <BR/>with "Server mode"."

  html: I don't have an issue with most of the "plug-and-pray" defaults of the Cisco
    switches.  If you want to pay too much for an unmanaged layer-2 network, by all
    means buy 3560s and plug them into your network without the aid of so much as
    a console cable.  <BR/><BR/>But VTP is dangerous.  Before configuring a trunk
    to anything, you need to know what is going on, and that includes management of
    your vtp domain.  Cisco shipping ALL switches as a VTP server right out of the
    box is insane.

  html: We leave VTP in transparent mode for nearly all devices.  A human screw-up
    with VTP is potentially catastrophic.  In addition, we don't want every switch
    to know about every VLAN in a VTP domain for reasons of a clean configuration
    and improved STP topology control.  Proper, common sense defaults with VTP would
    go a long way to making a VTP implementation palatable.<BR/><BR/>I have a similar
    gripe with other defaults, one being that switch interface ports come up enabled
    instead of shutdown.  We've had issues where a stack member in a 3750 stack loses
    its mind, comes up as a new number and is issued a default configuration from
    the stack master, and therefore uplinks all ports to VLAN1, including interfaces
    that may have been part of a cross-stack etherchannel previously.  The results
    are ugly.  It would be better for a naked switch to boot with all interfaces in
    a shutdown state, waiting for a grown up to configure them.<BR/><BR/>Cisco trying
    to make switches "just work" out of the box is pandering to the wrong crowd.  Cisco
    switches are feature-laden and outrageously expensive.  They aren't targeted at
    the home market.  In that context, the defaults should be set with the expectation
    of networking professionals installing them in data networking environments that
    matter.

  html: When you try to please everyone, you please no one.<BR/>There are several
    excellent tips mentioned here. There are also other things that can be done as
    well such placing unused ports in shutdown and/or access mode.  With the use of
    IOS macros and interface range commands, there are easy ways to prevent such issues<BR/>Here
    is an example of one of our switch macros:<BR/><BR/>macro name ROLLBACK<BR/>power
    inline never<BR/> switchport access vlan 340<BR/> switchport mode access<BR/>
    switchport port-security<BR/> switchport port-security max 1<BR/> switchport port-security
    aging time 5<BR/> switchport port-security violation restrict<BR/> bandwidth 10000000<BR/>
    srr-queue bandwidth limit 10<BR/> priority-queue out<BR/> no mdix auto<BR/> storm-control
    broadcast level 10.00<BR/> storm-control multicast level 40.00<BR/> storm-control
    action shutdown<BR/> storm-control action trap<BR/> no cdp enable<BR/> spanning-tree
    portfast<BR/> spanning-tree bpdufilter enable<BR/> spanning-tree bpduguard enable<BR/>
    spanning-tree guard root<BR/> ip dhcp snooping limit rate 90<BR/><BR/>This allows
    only 1 mac address on the port and does not participate in mdix

  html: Given the potentially catastrophic consequences I cannot believe that Cisco
    hasn't taken that step yet. <BR/><BR/>As far as I am concerned though, to me VTP
    behavior is just one of the many ciscocentric default idiosyncrasies one has to
    be aware of when deploying gear. <BR/><BR/>From the switchport mode being dynamic
    by default to ports having MOP enabled by default, Cisco is no better than Microsoft
    when it comes to things like that.<BR/><BR/>@ironhorse<BR/><BR/>I personally prefer
    disabling CPD altogether with a `no cdp run'. <BR/><BR/>Following global configuration
    commands for access ports come in handy as well.<BR/><BR/>spanning-tree portfast
    default<BR/>spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default<BR/>spanning-tree portfast
    bpduguard default<BR/><BR/>One thing I've always been curious about, if I have
    bpdufilter enabled already, isn't bpduguard superflous?

  html: I believe bpduguard and bpdufilter should be mutually exclusive.  Configuring
    one should unconfigure the other, since they have different effects on the same
    condition.<BR/><BR/>I've also never had a problem with VTP in fairly large switching
    environments and have always wondered what all the angst is about.

  html: Yeah, it may be a little overkill on the bpduguard stuff. I do like to have
    cdp enabled on my trunk ports that connect to my upstream switches. It helps with
    diagnostics. I disable it on any client facing interfaces.<BR/><BR/>bpdufilter
    does just that, filters bpdu sends &amp; receives.<BR/>bpduguard will errdisable
    the port if bpdu is received on the port.<BR/>per Cisco:<BR/>To prevent loops
    from occurring in a network, the PortFast mode is supported only on nontrunking
    access ports because these ports typically do not transmit or receive BPDUs. The
    most secure implementation of PortFast is to enable it only on ports that connect
    end stations to switches. Because PortFast can be enabled on nontrunking ports
    connecting two switches, spanning tree loops can occur because BPDUs are still
    being transmitted and received on those ports.<BR/><BR/>The PortFast BPDU guard
    feature prevents loops by moving a nontrunking port into an errdisable state when
    a BPDU is received on that port. When the BPDU guard feature is enabled on the
    switch, spanning tree shuts down PortFast-configured interfaces that receive BPDUs,
    instead of putting them into the spanning tree blocking state. In a valid configuration,
    PortFast-configured interfaces do not receive BPDUs. If a PortFast-configured
    interface receives a BPDU, an invalid configuration exists, such as connection
    of an unauthorized device. The BPDU guard feature provides a secure response to
    invalid configurations because the administrator must manually put the interface
    back in service. <BR/>One other thing I forgot to mention... it helps to keep
    the network diameter in control

  html: I'm glad other people share the same concerns my original question posed.
    What's even more perplexing though is that Cisco doesn't even take the extra step
    in documentation to point out the potential disaster when introducing a new switch
    to an existing VTP-enabled network..

  html: I vote to either disable VTP by default, or place VTP in transparent mode
    by default.<BR/><BR/>In Cisco's own Solution Reference Network Design (SRND) document
    it also said to place the switch in VTP Transparent mode instead of server because
    "The benefits of dynamic propagation of VLAN information across the network are
    not worth the potential for unexpected behavior due to operational error. For
    this reason, VTP transparent mode is the recommended configuration option.".<BR/><BR/>Here
    is the link to the referenced SRND:<BR/><BR/>http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Campus/HA_campus_DG/hacampusdg.html#wp1108226<BR/><BR/>Personally
    I would rather have full control of the switched network itself instead of relying
    on VTP to control the VLANs across the entire layer-2 switched domain.

  html: Tranparent is the way to go. We always set new switches to this mode before
    deployment. Besides, when you configure a switchport for a vlan, it adds it into
    the switch's vlan database.

  html: Personally I believe there is something fundamentally wrong with the way VTP
    functions. VTP Clients being allowed to update servers in certain scenario's,
    inheritance and just the thought of someone making a mistake and wiping an entire
    VTP domain's VLAN's, are just too much of a risk for most production networks.<BR/><BR/>VTP
    = Broken.<BR/><BR/>VTP = Broken.
