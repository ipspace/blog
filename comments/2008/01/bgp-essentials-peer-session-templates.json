      "html": "I wonder if Cisco would interest in creating something called promiscuous-mode EBGP? This would be similar to DLSw+ promoscuous mode. For example, if I can configure a headend router to terminate hundreds of incoming EBGP/IBGP peers w/o having to manually define each neighbor statement it would save a lot of config nightmare at the headend. You might ask why do we need it? For example, for DMVPN hub-and-spoke, the scalability improves if one uses BGP instead of EIGRP or OSPF. Although the true throughput may be limited by PPS, but it's the scalability of the terminations using BGP that is worth a look.",
