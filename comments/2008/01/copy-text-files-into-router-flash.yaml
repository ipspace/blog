  html: Hello everyone,I am working with a tcl script on cisco ios. <BR/>This command
    has been very helpful puts [open "flash:filename" w+] {. <BR/>however how do I
    use this repeatedly to append more strings into the same file without losing the
    previous data from the file?<BR/><BR/>Secondly, teh command at the end says input
    is from a file however can I need to use a tcl variable as the input to the command.
    How can I do this?<BR/>All suggestions are welcomed. Thank you in advance for
    all teh help.<BR/><BR/>You can reply back to me at maiyart@msn.com

  html: If you want to reopen the file and append more data to it, use a+ instead
    of w+. <BR/><BR/>See http://tmml.sourceforge.net/doc/tcl/open.html for details.<BR/><BR/>If
    you want to use more than one "puts" statement, store the channel# into a variable
    and use that variable in puts. For example,<BR/><BR/>set fl [open ...]<BR/>puts
    $fl "string"<BR/>puts $fl {string}<BR/>close $fl<BR/><BR/>See also http://tmml.sourceforge.net/doc/tcl/puts.html
    (examples)

  html: I'm just guessing ... Storing configurations on a TFTP server is something
    I do on a regular basis, and I usually overwrite existing files.<BR/><BR/>The
    problem is probably in the configuration of the TFTP server, which rejects an
    attempt to overwrite existing files.

  html: Try executing the same command manually from the CLI to test if it works.
    It should not generate any prompts, you might have to use <A HREF="http://blog.ioshints.info/2006/11/reduce-noise-generated-by-cisco-ios.html"
    REL="nofollow">file prompt quiet</A>.
