  html: dont forget to also use the "local-as" community if you are using confederations
    as no-export refers to the confederation and not the subconfederation.

  html: "I really came to this site looking for a Failover Solution for iBGP. Your\
    \ article with tags moved me in the correct direction and I appreciate the posted\
    \ comments on aggregation. My problem was simple, can one failover a remote iBGP\
    \ spoke location and have BGP act in a similar \u201CLink State\u201D protocol\
    \ as its Core Router? Moreover, can this solution not export iBGP routes in and\
    \ out of EIGRP or OSPF WAN routing protocols? <BR/>Without telling you the entire\
    \ whole story, the answer is \u201CYes it can be completed.\u201D However, it\
    \ quite complicated and one needs to be careful.  The solution utilizes route\
    \ maps, tags on static routes and BGP Backdoor commands. I am able to fail a remote\
    \ MPLS location (running iBGP) and have its IP Traffic traverse an IPSEC Tunnel\
    \ across the Internet and into an ASA. At the core router, I point that backup\
    \ traffic to that ASA. While the failover time is not instantaneous, it does resume\
    \ in less than 30 seconds. <BR/><BR/>Network Details;<BR/>Remote Site1: 10.1.60.1/24\
    \ and Remote Site2: 10.1.70.1/24<BR/>Core Router: 10.1.2.1/24 with Failover ASA:\
    \ 10.1.2.5/25<BR/><BR/>Here is what the Core Route configuration looks like;<BR/>!<BR/>router\

    \ @ timothy.barko@kimballcorp.com and I can explain in detail how it was completed\
    \ with the complete details on my Failover Solution."
