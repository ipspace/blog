      "html": "I am a bit puzzled about some statments in the article. You write:<BR/><I><BR/>or you could enable PMTUD for GRE tunnels with the tunnel path-mtu-discovery interface configuration command. When you enable the PMTUD on a GRE tunnel, the GRE packets are sent with the DF bit set and the router responds to the incoming ICMP destination unreachable messages with the reduction of the tunnel MTU size.<BR/></I><BR/><BR/>On the other hand, you write:<BR/><I><BR/>DF bit is copied from the source IP packet into the GRE envelope. If the source IP packet doesn\u2019t have the DF bit set, it won\u2019t be set in the outgoing GRE packet, potentially resulting in fragmentation of the GRE packet and expensive reassembly on the tail-end router.</I><BR/><BR/>How do these two statements connect? Which combination of tunnel path-mtu-discovery and a DF flag in an incoming package causes DF to be set on the GRE package?",

      "html": "Whilst the general consensus seems to be  that blocking ICMP, particularly unreachables, is braindead and/or the product of stupidity (see the opening paragraph of the article) it is worth bearing in mind that cisco <B>itself</B> is somewhat to blame for the unreliability of PMTUD by making it a tradeoff against speed on some of its platforms. See, for example, \"Catalyst 6500/6000 Switch High CPU Utilization\" (http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps708/products_tech_note09186a00804916e0.shtml#unreach) which says as the first \"performance solution\":<BR/><BR/>\"The drop of denied packets and generation of ICMP-unreachable messages imposes a load on the MSFC CPU. In order to eliminate the load, you can issue the no ip unreachables interface configuration command. This command disables ICMP-unreachable messages, which allows the drop in hardware of all access group-denied packets.\"<BR/><BR/>I'm sure there are many environments, trying to squeeze performance out of their expensive 6500s who look at that and see it as an easy decision. If cisco puts that kind of thing in the slowpath, it is no wonder that the rest of the world says \"who cares if PMTUD breaks\". Interestingly, that document makes no mention of PMTUD, or breaking it, at all!",
