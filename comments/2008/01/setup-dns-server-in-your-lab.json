      "html": "Well, a lot of things are broken in DNS forwarder in late 12.4T. <BR/><BR/>I've managed to configure my access router as split DNS for my Windows XP home LAN and it works great as long as it only handles A/SRV records. MX records are already a problem; my outbound mail was stuck for several weeks while IIS SMTP server was trying to resolve MX records.<BR/><BR/>When I've added a Fedora 8 Linux box that insists on running IPv6 (even though it's been turned off in every possible place I found), I've experienced huge startup delays in some applications (most notably Firefox) as they try to use IPv6 name resolution (AAAA records plus some other stuff) and Cisco IOS is less than perfect in forwarding them. In the end, I've used an external DNS for the Linux box ... and moved my SMTP server from IIS to Postfix.",
