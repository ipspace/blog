I personally found the on-line help the most critical feature made  available to mankind :-) Remember, back then if you couldn't memorize all the parameters associated to a command you will have to look for the parameters in the paperback manuals (I counted at least six big books plus a little handbook). So whenever I went to a customer site to turn up a router I also carried the manuals with me just in case. Terry had saved my lower back :-)",
