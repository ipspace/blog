  html: Could anybody explain what is the reason for such behavior of ip default-network
    command when subnetwork is specified? I've asked about it in the comment under
    the orginal article a couple of days ago, but unfortunately my post is still waiting
    for moderate.

  html: There are many things in life that are the way they are for no apparent reason
    :) Default-network is one of them and there are plenty more of them in Cisco IOS
    :))<BR/><BR/>Seriously, it's a leftover from days when we worked with classful
    IP routing and routing protocols did not carry subnet masks in the routing updates
    (IGRP, RIPv1, BGPv3). It should not be used any longer.

  html: Thanks for the explanation. Now I know why I couldn't make myself understood
    that behavior :)
