      "html": "Excellent article. <BR/><BR/>I noticed the title in the SearchTelecom version of the article omitted the words \"Service Provider\" - implying BGP is essential in all IP networks. This is clearly not the case. There are other solutions.<BR/><BR/>http://www.aspen-networks.com<BR/>http://www.f5.com<BR/><BR/>These can work for mainstream enterprises too. That being said, thanks for an informative piece.",

      "html": "Well, the site is focused exclusively on Service Providers (see its name), so one would expect the readers to be biased accordingly ;)<BR/><BR/>As for the other links you've provided, I can't see what's the advantage they offer from technology standpoint. They might be more focused on the task at hand, offer the solution in a less convoluted way than what we do today with IOS, but there are only a few field-proven technologies that can build a large scalable network today, BGP being one of them.",
