  html: Hi Ivan little offtopic here, its looks like Cisco preparing 12.5T for this
    year. Few things already pointing for that like history of previous releases and
    bug tracker ;). So I assume 12.4(15)T will be last release with new functionality.

  html: Is there any way to do this if your IOS doesn&#39;t have dual AS support?
    I.e. is there any way to reproduce the &quot;replace-as&quot; functionality?
