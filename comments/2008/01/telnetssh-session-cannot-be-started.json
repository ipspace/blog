      "html": "Ivan,<br /><br />Another way to get through the prompts is by using escape characters \\012 newline for the end of a command.  I had trouble when embedding these in event manager strings but you can create an alias and execute that.  <br />I used this for a remote site where we have several modules (a fully loaded 3845 as well as an IPS module in an ASA).  The modules have hard drives which can get corrupt if power is cut suddenly so we wanted a UPS device connnected to the aux port of the 3845 to shut them down if the power goes out.  This was complicated by the fact that the ASA is even more clunky than IOS, doesn&#39;t support event manager or tcl scripts that I could remotely kick off and doesn&#39;t even support the &#39;aaa authentication exec if-authenticated&#39; command which would have at least allowed me to shut the module down with a single command executed via ssh.<br /><br />The solution was a configuration on the 3845 which looked like this:<br />!<br />!<br />alias exec asa_ips_shutdown ssh -l admshutdown 10.16.15.244 &quot;enable\\012SECRETPASSWORD\\012hw-module module 1 shutdown\\012\\012exit\\012&quot;<br />!<br />event manager applet SHUTDOWN<br /> event none<br /> action 1.0 cli command &quot;enable&quot;<br /> action 2.0 cli command &quot;service-module Se3/0 shutdown no-confirm&quot;<br /> action 3.0 cli command &quot;service-module In4/0 shutdown no-confirm&quot;<br /> action 4.0 cli command &quot;service-module An1/0 shutdown no-confirm&quot;<br /> action 5.0 cli command &quot;service-module ID2/0 shutdown no-confirm&quot;<br /> action 6.0 cli command &quot;asa_ips_shutdown&quot; pattern &quot;word:&quot;<br /> action 7.0 cli command &quot;SECRETPASSWORD&quot; pattern &quot;#&quot;<br />!<br />!<br />line aux 0<br /> privilege level 15<br /> modem Dialin<br /> autocommand  event manager run SHUTDOWN<br />!<br />!<br /><br /><br />The \\012 characters in the alias are the equivalent of hitting return, so the alias basically connects SSH to the ASA, enables, enters the enable password, tells the IPS module to shutdown, confirms the shutdown, and exits the SSH session.<br /><br />This work around should allow for any tasks that could be accomplished passing commands over an interactive session.<br /><br />Jason",

This feature allows an operator to execute a command on the Cisco ASR 9000 Series Router without logging into the Cisco ASR 9000 Series Router, using non-interactive SSH mode. The result of the command is sent via the established channel to the operator. The SSH client running on the operator end prints the output.",
