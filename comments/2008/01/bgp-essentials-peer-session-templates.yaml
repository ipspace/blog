  html: I wonder if Cisco would interest in creating something called promiscuous-mode
    EBGP? This would be similar to DLSw+ promoscuous mode. For example, if I can configure
    a headend router to terminate hundreds of incoming EBGP/IBGP peers w/o having
    to manually define each neighbor statement it would save a lot of config nightmare
    at the headend. You might ask why do we need it? For example, for DMVPN hub-and-spoke,
    the scalability improves if one uses BGP instead of EIGRP or OSPF. Although the
    true throughput may be limited by PPS, but it's the scalability of the terminations
    using BGP that is worth a look.

    REL="nofollow">Anonymous BGP peers with neighbor templates</A> were implemented
    at least in Cisco Software release 9.21 (they might have been in 9.1 release,
    but 9.1 documentation is missing from CCO). Sadly, this feature was later removed
    from IOS.
