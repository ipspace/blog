  html: Terry is the man. I remembered attending his training class in September 1994
    and he told me about these CLI enhancements (and yes he told me he was the lead
    engineer on this project). I personally found the on-line help the most critical
    feature made  available to mankind :-) Remember, back then if you couldn't memorize
    all the parameters associated to a command you will have to look for the parameters
    in the paperback manuals (I counted at least six big books plus a little handbook).
    So whenever I went to a customer site to turn up a router I also carried the manuals
    with me just in case. Terry had saved my lower back :-)
