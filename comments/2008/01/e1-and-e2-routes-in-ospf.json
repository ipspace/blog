Three of the ABRs are generating a OSPF default route with a metric of 200 and 1 is using a metric of 1000. The show ip ospf database external 0.0.0.0 shows that the default originate with 200  as an E2 and the default originate with the metric of 1000 as and E2 route.  The ABR with a metric of 1000 is the BDR and the ABR with metrics of 200 are the DRs. The default route for clients of the DRs prefer the BDR default route with a metric of 1000 over the default of the DR with a metric of 200. Any ideas on how to fix this situation?<br /><br /><br />Thanks,",

Do you know the reason for this feature (or bug)?<br /><br />One similar case where behaviour is different is identical externals from the same ASBR, which is also an ABR, received across two distinct areas from another ABR in the same areas: these are selected by cost, with possible ECM, at least in 12.4(4)T1. This seems to be consistent with section 16.4.1 of RFC2328.<br /><br />No matter how many times you read RFC2328, there is always one more case that forces you to read it again and fire up GNS3.<br /><br />",

I have read Appendix G.7 of RFC 2178 before and it doesn&#39;t give the answer to my question. <br /><br />We consider situations only with RFC1583Compatibility = disabled.<br /><br />Appendix G.7 of RFC 2178 talks about one ASBR but we have two ASBRs.

         "html": "You are almost 100% in your original post with the two rules at the end, but i would correct them to the following:<br /><br />With multiple ASBRs, the rules for selecting the AS-external LSA that will be preferred are the following:<br />1) When comparing E2 routes, only the external costs (E2 metric value) are compared, as per Section 16.4 paragraph 6.b<br />2) If we still can&#39;t select the best, it means that the external cost has tied. External routes received from a non-backbone intra-area ASBR should be preferred over external routes received from ASBRs in other areas, as per Section 16.4.1.<br /><br />I am not sure which network you are talking about in your latest reply, but i will assume you are talking about the network in G.7 of RFC 2178. In this network, we have A1 selecting one of the two AS-external LSAs it has received, and then we have B1 making a similar decision. Both AS-external LSAs have the same E2 metric. Both routers have the same two AS-external LSAs in their LSDB:<br /><br />1. from A3, and<br />2. from B3<br /><br />First, we will examine A1:<br /><br />The forwarding cost to reach A3 (from A1) is 6. The forwarding cost to reach B3 is 4 (as advertised by B2). As per RFC 2328, section 16.4 (6)(d), the least forwarding cost will be preferred:<br /><br />                                                 Type 2<br />external paths advertising equal type 2 metrics are<br />compared by looking at the distance to the forwarding<br />addresses.<br /><br />A1 does not distinguish between A3 (which is a backbone intra-area ASBR) and B3 (which is an inter-area ASBR).<br /><br />Therefore, A1 will prefer routing to B3 via B1.<br /><br />Now let&#39;s look at B1:<br /><br />B1 has one path to B3, and one path to A3:<br /><br />1. cost of intra-area path to B3: 8<br />2. cost of intra-area path to A3: 7<br /><br />According to RFC1583 rules, B1 will prefer to use the path to A3, causing a loop.<br /><br />Now assume that the algorithm from RFC 2328 is used, and B1 installs the path to network N (10.0.0.0/8) into the OSPF RIB via A3 (because the AS-external LSA from A3 was examined first).<br />Now B1 examines the next AS-external LSA that it has received from B3:<br /><br />steps 16.4(1) and 16.4(2) are false, so we start examining the third paragraph of 16.4(3):<br /><br />There is a single routing table entry for the ASBR, so the set of routing table entries is NOT pruned. At this point, you are correct. Then, we move to step 16.4(6) where we examine if the path via A3 which is already in the OSPF routing table will be replaced by the path via B3:<br /><br />(a) Both entries are AS external paths - no replacement<br />(b) Both AS-external LSAs advertise equal E2 costs - no replacement<br />(c) This step says:<br /><br />select the preferred paths based on the intra-AS paths to the<br />ASBR/forwarding addresses, as specified in Section 16.4.1. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; This step assumes that there are two paths. Because at this point, you must be comparing two different paths, to two separate ASBRs.<br /><br />We have to go to section 16.4.1 to select one of the two intra-area ASBRs:<br />According to 16.4.1:<br />The Intra-area path to an ASBR using the non-backbone area is preferred to the intra-area backbone path to another ASBR. The intra-area path to B3 is preferred to the backbone path to A3, and so the routing table entry to N via A3 gets replaced.<br /><br />To find the implementation &quot;bug&quot; in IOS, set up the RFC2178/G.7 network, and watch IOS create a routing loop. And keep in mind that this is not a bug. When contacting Cisco TAC, the boilerplate answer you will get is either:<br /><br />1. Upgrade to NX-OS or IOS-XE<br />2. Do not create this weird scenario<br />3. Configure Multi-Area Adjacency (RFC 5185) between B1-B2<br /><br />I am not clear as to what your point is, or what exactly you are asking. Do you believe that IOS *does* implement RFC 2328 precisely? Because it does not. Again, just watch the loop that was supposed to not exist (because of section 16.4.1) appear when you set up the RFC2178/G.7 network.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Angelos Vassiliou @ipmess",

         "html": "Hi, Wizard!<br /><br />Thanks for such a great answer!<br /><br />My initial problem was to understand how OSPF E2 route selection should work according to RFC. Since there were multiple RFCs, RFCs not clearly written (my personal opinion), and there are some bugs in implementation from different vendors it is hard to inderstand why routing loops appear.<br /><br /><br />In particular I was investigating how E2 route selection works in a sample network.<br /><br />Sample network topology as below:<br /><br />R1(ASBR) =(192.168.1.0/24, area 0)= R2 =(192.168.2.0/24, area 1)= R3 (ASBR)<br /><br />Router R4 is in network 192.168.2.0/24 (router on a stick)<br /><br /><br />IP @ as follloing:<br />R1 - 192.168.1.1<br />R2 - 192.168.1.12, 192.168.2.12<br />R3 - 192.168.2.3<br />R4 - 192.168.2.23<br /><br /><br />R1 advertises default route with E2 metric 19<br />R3 advertises default route with E2 metric 20<br /><br />R4 is router-under-test.<br /><br />While testing I got that R4 chooses E2 route with metric 19, i. e. route from ASBR R1 that is in another area (route from intra-area ASBR R3 appeared to be worse).<br /><br /><br />Here is why this Ivan&#39;s post confused me a lot. If to look from R4 perspective and read route selection rules from top to bottom we hit rule #4:<br /><br />&quot;External routes received from an intra-area ASBR should be preferred over external routes received from ASBRs in other areas&quot;<br /><br />According to this rule R4 should select E2-route with metric 20, but that is not true in practice. Seems like the rule assumes that E2 metrics are the same or it is not in its place (has wrong order). <br /><br />In my case it doesn&#39;t seem that we faced some Cisco bug. Perhaps that there are some implementation bugs that make RFC2178/G.7 network to fail but in my case Cisco seems to work according to RFC. I have also tested Juniper vMX and it behaves the same as Cisco.<br /><br /><br />Your last post made me thinking that my understaning was correct.<br /><br />Thanks again!<br /><br />BR  ",

         "html": "Hello Pavel,<br /><br />You are perfectly right!<br /><br />RFC 2328 with RFC1583Compatibility disabled dictates the following behavior at R4 in the example internetwork you presented originally:<br /><br />1. R4 will make a list of all the ASBRs that it advertise the particular prefix. In this case, the prefix is the default route, and the two ASBRs that advertise this prefix are R1 and R3 (192.168.1.1 and 192.168.2.3).<br />2. R4 will then check if there are any intra-area ASBRs in this list of ASBRs. In this case, there is. R3 is intra-area, whereas R1 is an inter-area ASBR. Note that the rule separates the list of ASBRs into two categories:<br />i. Backbone and inter-area ASBRs<br />ii. Intra-area ASBRs<br />3. Prefer the intra-area ASBRs. If there are no intra-area ASBRs, use the inter-area ASBRs. If there is at least a single intra-area ASBR, ignore *all* the backbone and inter-area ASBRs. What happens in effect is that backbone and inter-area ASBRs are _filtered_ out from the list of ASBRs. In this example, the inter area ASBR (R1) is filtered out from the list of ASBRs, and the only ASBR available that advertises the default route is R3. R4 chooses to route to the only available ASBR for the default route, and thus adds a default route via R3.<br />4. After the backbone and inter-area ASBRs have been filtered, go through the whole selection process as described in this blog post.<br /><br />Your main problem of course is the decision process at R2, the ABR.<br /><br />The main point here is to understand the following: E2 is king. Always select the route with the lowest E2 metric, ignoring all other path selection criteria.<br />After that, if there are several paths with equal E2 metric, there are two differing behaviors:<br /><br />1. In RFC 1583, Cisco IOS, and RFC 2328 with RFC1583Compatibility enabled: select the path with the lowest forward metric. If there are several paths with equal-cost forward metric, add all paths into the OSPF routing table.<br />2. In RFC 2328 with RFC1583Compatibility disabled: First, prune all intra-backbone and inter-area ASBRs. Second, of any remaining ASBRs, select the lowest cost forward metric. If there still are several equal-cost forward metric paths to the external destination, add all paths into the OSPF routing table.<br /><br />I will follow the steps of RFC 2328, Section 16.4 to dissect how R2 in your example internetwork will determine it should route to R1 (and not to R3) for the default route:<br /><br />First, the AS-external-LSA from R3 is examined:<br /><br />16.4(3): N: 0.0.0.0/0. There is an entry for R3 as an ASBR in R2&#39;s routing table. Since the LSA&#39;s forwarding address is 0.0.0.0, packets should be sent to the ASBR itself. Since there is only one entry for the ASBR, no pruning will be performed.<br />16.4(4): X: 1 (i will assume it is 1, but this is irrelevant). Y: 20<br />16.4(5): There is no entry for destination N yet. The path gets installed into the routing table. Path-type: 2, X:1, Y:20.<br />16.4(6): N/A since there was no entry for N yet.<br /><br />Next, the  AS-external-LSA from R1 is examined:<br /><br />16.4(3): N: 0.0.0.0/0. There is an entry for R1 as an ASBR in R2&#39;s routing table. Since the LSA&#39;s forwarding address is 0.0.0.0, packets should be sent to the ASBR itself. Since there is only one entry for the ASBR, no pruning will be performed.<br />16.4(4): X: 1 (i will assume it is 1, but this is irrelevant). Y: 19<br />16.4(5): There already is an entry for destination N in the routing table.<br />16.4(6): Compare the AS external path described by the LSA with the existing paths in N&#39;s routing table entry, as follows:<br />16.4(6)(a): The already-installed path is AS external, therefore we go to the next step.<br />16.4(6)(b): Both paths are type 2 external paths. The the paths with the smallest advertised type 2 metric are always preferred. In this case, the older entry from the routing table will be replaced by the path via R1. This clause makes the E2 metric king.",
