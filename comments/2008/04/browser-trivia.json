A good number of readers, especially in such a tech-savvy demographic, are likely to have browser plugins like NoScript or Adblock which may be preventing the GA Javascript from being executed and thus not registering as a hit. GA underreporting by ten or twenty percent isn't uncommon.",

As I also use statcounter (which uses IMG tags if the JavaScript is disabled), I'll try to compare the two.<BR/><BR/>@whisper: you've made my day ;)",
