  html: This is part of the problem with NTP. It's way more complicated then it needs
    to be. You shouldn't have to understand so much of it to use it on your routers.
    Take a look at openntpd. It's free and runs on bsd or linux. I run it on my dns
    servers. My routers are pointed at it.

  html: Ivan,<BR/><BR/>This is the basic NTP configuration I use on 'my' routers at
    work:<BR/>access-list 50 remark NTP Access - apply with:<BR/>access-list 50 remark
    __ntp access-group peer 50<BR/>access-list 50 remark<BR/>access-list 50 remark
    Permit only (hostname snipped)<BR/>access-list 50 permit 10.0.0.1<BR/>access-list
    50 remark<BR/>access-list 50 remark Deny everyone else<BR/>access-list 50 deny   any<BR/>access-list
    50 remark<BR/><BR/>ntp source loopback 0<BR/>ntp access-group peer 50<BR/>ntp
    server 10.0.0.1 prefer<BR/><BR/>If I don't put in the access-group stuff, then
    the router will respond to port scans on UDP 123.
