            <div class="comment-content">And of course the number one reason for attending a bootcamp: work is paying!<BR/><BR/>Seriously though, I've been considering a CCNP bootcamp to suite my somewhat unique situation. Being positioned indefinitely in Iraq, I've had more than ample time to study and do labs, but no opportunity to actually test. The prospect of getting 100% comfortable with all the material, then flying back to the US on leave and knocking out all four exams at once via bootcamp is very appealing.</div>
