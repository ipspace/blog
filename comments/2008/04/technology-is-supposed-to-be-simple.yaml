    html: P.S.<br />I have a hard time thinking of why you would NOT want your Network
      devices to just be NTP Clients and use the 1U Stratum 1 Appliances. It removes
      any dependency on the Internet and provides significantly better service.

    html: Some people lack CapEx needed to achieve simple accuracy ... or someone
      figures out synchronized time is important after all the budget has been burnt.

  html: Comments about timing being easy make Timing industry people cry.<BR/><BR/>Companies
    like Symmetricom http://www.symmttm.com/ have huge product lines that would meet
    any possible need for timing. <BR/><BR/>I never fully understood the need for
    accurate timing until I went to a timing conference and learned just how elaborate
    a timing network can be, and how useful precision is in resolving network incidents
    (security or failure).

  html: In simple single area OSPF with nothing but LAN links, I've always wondered
    what are <B>ALL</B> the arguments against doing:<BR/><BR/>network 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
    area 0<BR/><BR/>:)

  html: I can't find any. If all you want to do is run OSPF in area 0 on all interfaces,
    that's the way to configure it.
