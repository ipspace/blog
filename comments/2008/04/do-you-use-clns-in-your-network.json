      "html": "You probably should clarify that you are talking about routing CLNS/CLNP packets, not using CLNS as the underpinnings for IS-IS in an IP network. <BR/><BR/>The only people I've ever talked to who used large CLNS networks in the 21st century are those who were using them for managing large SONET control networks. My understanding is that these can be quite vast, so it seems unlikely that they have disappeared entirely. But it's probably a specialized enough application that not many people are going to know about it.<BR/><BR/>The last RFC I can find on CLNS is RFC 3147, dated 2001. There's also an expired draft of a CLNS/MPLS-VPN extension dated 2005. See http://tools.ietf.org/draft/draft-vohra-l3vpn-bgp-clns/draft-vohra-l3vpn-bgp-clns-00.txt<BR/><BR/>So there definitely doesn't seem to be much contemporary activity on it.<BR/><BR/>I'd be interested to see any additional followup you get on this topic.",

The CLNS protocol is solid once up and running.<br /><br />Compared to IPv4 addresses the OSI addresses are large and cumbersome but start to look like IPv6 more and more.<br /><br />There are different issues to deal with CLNS i.e. the DG is the closest until it fails, Cisco supports a CLNS version that acts subtly different to the IP/CLNS version (Integrated ISIS), very few people understand and can use it.  Saying that we have it running so solidly you&#39;d think it was perfect.<br /><br />I like it but feel, as JS above, that it will fade away in the Telco market as the IP managed devices take over but will live in the SP arena for the foreseeable future due to it&#39;s stability and multiple configuration options.",
