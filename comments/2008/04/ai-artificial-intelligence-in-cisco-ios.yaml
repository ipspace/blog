  html: Good morning,<BR/><BR/>The thing with the OSPF network wildcard is not about
    matching subnets, it is meant to match the IP's associated with the interfaces.<BR/>If
    the interface IP is within the specified network with wildcard mask , OSPF is
    enabled on that interface. <BR/><BR/>That's just how OSPF knows in which interfaces
    it should run.

  html: You're absolutely right, I was yet again skipping the basics and jumping to
    the juicy part. <BR/><BR/>I've changed the wording slightly, maybe it's less misleading
    now. I've also included links to a few previous posts on the same topic (unfortunately
    Blogger can't do that on its own regardless of <A HREF="http://buzz.blogger.com/2008/04/announcing-google-weblogs-beta.html"
    REL="nofollow">Google's promises made on April 1st</A> :).<BR/><BR/>And, most
    importantly, thanks for keeping me honest!<BR/>Ivan

  html: Selling that minor feature as AI is so overrated that I think Cisco should
    hire you in Sales :-)

  html: Ivan,<BR/><BR/>   This has been around for many years.. I would venture to
    say since 11.2 or earlier.  I'm pretty sure I learned about it during an ICRC
    or ACRC class at Chesapeake Computer Consultants in the 90s.  Cisco AI has been
    a staple for a decade! :)<BR/><BR/>Jeremy Filliben

  html: I found out a reason not to use network 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0<BR/><BR/>In the Cisco
    Network Academys Cisco Network Simulator, Packetracer 4.11 the command doesn't
    work. :)<BR/><BR/>You have put in matching network statements for the interfaces
    you want included in your OSPF process!<BR/><BR/>PacketTracer isn't featureriffic,
    but if you want to check something simple very quickly without having to power
    up and cable your rack and wait for your old 2511 to finally boot up, its not
    a bad little tool.<BR/><BR/>Cheers<BR/>Shaun

  html: I actually started to notice the "intelligence" under EIGRP first (three years
    ago perhaps?). When you configure EIGRP today you can choose either way and the
    IOS would know what to put in. For example, if you type in either of the following:<BR/><BR/>router
    eigrp 333<BR/> network 10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0<BR/><BR/>or <BR/><BR/>router eigrp
    333<BR/> network 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255<BR/><BR/>The resulting EIGRP config would
    display "network 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255" under router EIGRP. <BR/><BR/>I didn't
    bother trying it under OSPF because I was taught, since the beginning, to enter
    OSPF network mask the "right" way.
