  html: Let's not forget that most of this cheap Linksys hardware runs Linux inside.
    What people want is convenience and a pre-packaged product. Open-source crowd
    alone is rarely good at delivering that unless the product is really mass market.

  html: You have to be careful not to expand the debate over an integrated server
    to full-blown open source network infrastructure. While the AXP seems like a neat
    idea to me, it also seems overpriced and underpowered, and Cisco will probably
    cripple available functionality.

  html: '@vladimir: thanks for the information. Never touched a Linksys box in my
    life :) And I completely agree with you.<BR/><BR/>@whisper: I''ve seen that a
    few years ago, but could never figure out why I''d do it (if nothing else, a 2500
    is way louder than an old low-end PC :).<BR/><BR/>@stretch: Absolutely agree ..
    and that was exactly my point - the writers I''ve quoted should tell us something
    useful about AXP.'

  html: '@stretch: ... and, yes, it looks like the functionality is severely limited,
    but mainly for security reasons that I can fully agree with. <BR/><BR/>Maybe,
    just maybe, if I could get my hands on a sample ...'

  html: I am a huge open source kind of person, but one thing I like not having to
    worry about is a hard drive failure in my router :). We lose PC hardware everyday
    here.
