    command?

  html: Are packets that hit the route-map statement still going to processed quickly
    though?<BR/><BR/>Or is that the beauty if the Quantum Flow processors, full IOS
    flexability, no hit to the forwarding rate?

  html: '@William: I still haven''t figured out the details, but it looks like the
    decision which packet to mark is an <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_%28complexity%29"
    REL="nofollow">NP-problem</A> which is obviously not easily solved in polynomial
    time. However, with non-deterministic quantum processors, the decision can be
    reached at line speeds.<BR/><BR/>@whisper: once the security bit is set, checking
    it is fast (like you''d check IP precedence or DSCP class).'

  html: 'To set the record straight: if you''ve followed the link to the RFC text,
    you probably noticed that it was published on April 1st 2003 ... and my post was
    published exactly five years later :)<BR/><BR/>Unfortunately we still have to
    rely on deterministic techniques like firewalls and IPS to identify &ldquo;evil&rdquo;
    packets &hellip; and a working quantum computer hasn''t been demonstrated  yet,
    regardless of how a certain chipset is named ;)'
