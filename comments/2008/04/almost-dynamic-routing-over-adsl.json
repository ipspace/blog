One quick question: how would you implement port forwarding from the Internet into the LAN using this scenario?  <BR/><BR/>I've been using a setup similar to this for about a year now, and haven't found an answer to that.  For now, each host has to have 2 private IP's, with each statically mapped to a single IP in both ISP 1 and ISP 2 subnet blocks.  Then port forwarding works.  Any ideas?",
