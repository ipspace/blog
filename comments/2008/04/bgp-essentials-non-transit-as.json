      "html": "@jdenoy: Thanks for the text. It's amazing how quickly the Internet landscape changes (and luckily Google caches a few things :).<BR/><BR/>@singh: I apologize for the brevity of my text, I shall write a follow-up one explaining the principles of the non-transit AS (and what you have to filter and where). However, here are the details as they relate to the text jdenoy included:<BR/><BR/>* Every as-path access-list has an implicit \"deny all\" at the end. The as-path access-list in the example thus matches nothing at all.<BR/><BR/>* The routes received from an EBGP neighbor always have at least one AS number in the AS path. The \"deny ^$\" pattern (which matches an empty AS-path) is thus irrelevant. But, as said above, everything else would be dropped as well.<BR/><BR/>* You cannot use an as-path access-list to match the origin code (even though it looks like the origin code is part of an AS-path, it's not).<BR/><BR/>* There is no such thing as incomplete AS-paths.<BR/><BR/>* The 'incomplete' origin code is a leftover of the past long gone and is mostly irrelevant these days. It definitely has nothing to do with (non)transit behavior.<BR/><BR/>* The route-map in the text supplied by jdenoy when applied to inbound updates from an EBGP peer would drop all inbound BGP prefixes.<BR/><BR/>Hope this helps<BR/>Ivan",

My Hub router DMVPN(Phase 2) is using IP as-path, <br />ip as-path access-list 100 deny _65000$<br />ip as-path access-list 100 permit .*<br /><br />I would like to deny for 65000 but allowing all for the spokes.<br />I can see the dynamic tunnel is up however the BGP routing showing the next hop to reach destination still going to Hub IP, then only reach to destination. When I removed the IP AS-Path, then the spoke router getting the correct information on BGP and able traverse via dynamic tunnels to other spoke. Is this a limitation of DMVPN or IP AS-Path?",
