I'm pretty sure I learned about it during an ICRC or ACRC class at Chesapeake Computer Consultants in the 90s.  Cisco AI has been a staple for a decade! :)<BR/><BR/>Jeremy Filliben",

When you configure EIGRP today you can choose either way and the IOS would know what to put in. For example, if you type in either of the following:<BR/><BR/>router eigrp 333<BR/> network 10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0<BR/><BR/>or <BR/><BR/>router eigrp 333<BR/> network 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255<BR/><BR/>The resulting EIGRP config would display \"network 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255\" under router EIGRP. <BR/><BR/>I didn't bother trying it under OSPF because I was taught, since the beginning, to enter OSPF network mask the \"right\" way.",
