  html: Should the line<BR/>"track 100 interface Dialer3 ip routing"<BR/>point to
    Dialer0 instead? I'm still pretty rough with this stuff so ignore me if I've missed
    something obvious. Very neat though.

  html: You're absolutely right. I've fixed the post and (like any good electronic
    engineer :) color-coded the interface names.

  html: Hello Ivan, why is the tracking needed? Wouldn't it work without? Thanks regards,

  html: A "dialer" interface is always in an up/up state, even when it's not connected
    to a remote peer (otherwise the regular dialing functionality wouldn't work).
    <BR/><BR/>If the PPPoE session underlying the Dialer interface is not operational,
    the static route without the "track" option would still point to the interface
    and attract the traffic.

  html: You do not need the route "ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 Dialer0 10 track 100"
    and the tracking if you configure "ppp ipcp route default" on interface Dialer0.<BR/>Works
    the same way... :-)

  html: 'Thanks for the great articles, Ivan.  One quick question: how would you implement
    port forwarding from the Internet into the LAN using this scenario?  <BR/><BR/>I''ve
    been using a setup similar to this for about a year now, and haven''t found an
    answer to that.  For now, each host has to have 2 private IP''s, with each statically
    mapped to a single IP in both ISP 1 and ISP 2 subnet blocks.  Then port forwarding
    works.  Any ideas?'

  html: Hi Ivan, Great blog site!  Instead of the tracking, could you get away with:<br
    /><br />ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 &lt;Dialer0&#39;s default router IP&gt;<br />ip
    route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 Dialer1 250
