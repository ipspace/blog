  html: You compose and deploy iACLs, then CoPP policies and GTSM, all in order to
    remove any possibility that your  XBox 360 and your MythTV DVR might gang up try
    and take down an eBGP session.

  html: 7. You run MPLS TE in each core between P-routers and tunnel LDP inside TE-tunnels
    ... because running full mesh TE between PEs doesn't scale.<BR/>8. You implement
    RTBH just in case<BR/>9. You set up a complex communities-driven policy, even
    if the goal of the lab is just to test some obscure SRC feature.

  html: And just when you think you have got the best SP network implemented your
    largest customers then forces you to add a bunch of GRE and L2TPv3 tunnels to
    cure *their* problems.<BR/><BR/>Finally, your customer asked that they wanted
    your network to support X.25 switching :-)
