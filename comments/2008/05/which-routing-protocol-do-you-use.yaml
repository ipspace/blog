  html: If not EIGRP, assuming you're running cisco gear, what's another viable IGP
    to run inside?  I'm still fairly new at all this, so I might be missing something
    obvious.  However I was under the impression that RIP, even V2, wasn't entirely
    viable in the "enterprise" realm.

  html: I wonder how many people would be using EIGRP if it wasn't Cisco proprietory?<BR/><BR/>Automated
    load balancing & ease of configuration with fast convergence, made it exceptionally
    powerful.<BR/><BR/>Is it too late for Cisco to release it?

  html: We use EIGRP in an enterprise setting with thousands of routers.  It works
    well, mostly.  EIGRP "stuck in active" can cause flapping adjacencies when a big
    network is under duress, as happened to us recently when a core router "sort of"
    crashed.  If the device had truly committed to crashing instead of being half-hearted
    about it, life would be have been better for us.  ;-)  Instead, we had a lot of
    withdrawn routes that confused the heck out of an MPLS cloud.<BR/><BR/>We use
    BGP to exchange routes with extranet partners and high-volume customers.  I'm
    planning on using more BGP for things like host route injection - not because
    BGP is the only option, but because it gives me outstanding flexibility in policy
    creation.<BR/><BR/>We are evaluating pushing EIGRP into outlying islands, and
    converting the remaining core to OSPF.  OSPF gives us the same fast convergence
    that EIGRP gives us, but it also gives us vendor interoperability.  While our
    L2/L3 infrastructure is Cisco, our load balancers and security devices are generally
    NOT Cisco.  Practically all of our non-Cisco gear talks OSPF.  While today we
    use static routes on our security devices and load-balancers, distributing routes
    to these devices dynamically via OSPF would have payoffs in terms of automatic
    error recovery and ease of administration.

  html: We use OSPF as IGP for internal routes and BGP for peering with external neighbors.
    OSPF as IGP primarily because we use multivendor enviroment

  html: Since working for big telco company, we are using wide range of routing protocols.
    BGP&OSPF in MPLS backbone, EIGRP/RIP inside of customers tunnels, BGP&IS-IS in
    Internet backbone.

  html: I normally recommend the following:<BR/><BR/>For PE-CE MPLS-VPN -> BGP<BR/><BR/>For
    strictly IGP -> EIGRP, followed by OSPF if devices aren't Cisco.

  html: Working for a regional ilec/clec, we use IS-IS for the backbone IGP, EIGRP
    for CDN & old dialup gear, OSPF for SONET, and PE-CE MPLS links and transit services
    via BGP.<BR/><BR/>IS-IS has been very good to us, but we are just now beginning
    the process of migrating all but the /32s out to BGP.

    (local-area mobility) doesn't count as a routing protocol ;)
