  html: Can you check the same thing with EIGRP?<BR/>Maybe some other protocols (not
    necessary routing) are also exempted? I bet on IPSsec, GRE and IPinIP.<BR/>May
    you test this issue with SCTP(IP/132, RFC4960) ?

  html: '@Colin: the ''match-all'' is the default produced by the router. I did not
    enter it manually (you have to enter ''match-any'' manually, if I remember correctly).<BR/><BR/>@Visir:
    I thought about that as well, but then the DBD packets are not sent as multicast
    on multi-access networks (or at least that was my understanding, but I might be
    wrong) and without the DBD packets the OSPF adjacency would not be established.<BR/><BR/>@Anonymous:
    it looks like CoPP works only for TCP and UDP, but I would have to do more tests.'

  html: looks like CSCso12838 but you forgot to specify the IOS you're using. try
    using the "police" keyword with the "drop" option for both "conform"-ing and "exceed"-ing
    traffic instead of the "drop" action.

  html: Ivan:<BR/><BR/>I just tested again on a router that was running IOS 12.4(15)T5
    and here are my results:<BR/><BR/>1. Drop didn't work if I attached the service
    policy under the control-plane host sub-interface (like what you did)<BR/><BR/>2.
    Drop worked if I attached the service policy under the control-plane main interface
    (without the host keyword), which was similar to what I did in IOS 12.4 mainline.<BR/><BR/>So
    in other words, below works in IOS 12.4(15)T5 if I don't put the policy under
    control-plane host. <BR/><BR/>class-map match-all BlockOSPF<BR/>match access-group
    name B-OSPF<BR/>!<BR/>policy-map OSPF<BR/>class BlockOSPF<BR/>drop<BR/>!<BR/>ip
    access-list extended B-OSPF<BR/>permit ospf host 199.11.18.171 any<BR/>!<BR/>control-plane<BR/>service-policy
    input OSPF<BR/>!<BR/><BR/>From the Cisco doc it said that the use of the host
    subinterface for control-plane is optional, so I guess we can use it as a workaround
    for now and open a case with Cisco for the host subinterface issue.<BR/><BR/>Thoughts?<BR/><BR/>William

  html: Yeah, the Cisco doc was confusing because in one area it said the host subinterface
    would be used to handle traffic destined to the router itself (including OSPF,
    EIGRP, etc). So now the aggregate conrol plane interface is like a "catch-all"
    interface for anything else :-)

  html: Guys, my understanding of this issue is that multicast traffic is handled
    by 'control-plane transit' policy. It works well for OSPF and LDP, where only
    the unicast packets for both protocols are being taken care of by 'control-plane
    host'.
