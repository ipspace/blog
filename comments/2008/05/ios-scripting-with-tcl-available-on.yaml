  html: Could I use TCL to quickly update a bunch of interface descriptions?  <BR/><BR/>I
    need to block loads of old ports as they shouldn't be used.  I currently have
    an excel macro that produces the config for me ie, <BR/><BR/>int s1/1/1<BR/>desc
    do not use!<BR/>int s1/1/2 etc etc<BR/><BR/>Would TCL make this quicker?  Any
    tips on the code as I'm little wary of practicing on the live network!

  html: '@Anonymous#2: Sure you can. If this is not something you do on a daily basis,
    you''re probably better off using Excel.<BR/><BR/>Also, using an off-line tool
    to prepare large-scale changes to configuration is probably better than executing
    a Tcl script on the router.'
