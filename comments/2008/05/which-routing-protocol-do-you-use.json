      "html": "We use EIGRP in an enterprise setting with thousands of routers.  It works well, mostly.  EIGRP \"stuck in active\" can cause flapping adjacencies when a big network is under duress, as happened to us recently when a core router \"sort of\" crashed.  If the device had truly committed to crashing instead of being half-hearted about it, life would be have been better for us.  ;-)  Instead, we had a lot of withdrawn routes that confused the heck out of an MPLS cloud.<BR/><BR/>We use BGP to exchange routes with extranet partners and high-volume customers.  I'm planning on using more BGP for things like host route injection - not because BGP is the only option, but because it gives me outstanding flexibility in policy creation.<BR/><BR/>We are evaluating pushing EIGRP into outlying islands, and converting the remaining core to OSPF.  OSPF gives us the same fast convergence that EIGRP gives us, but it also gives us vendor interoperability.  While our L2/L3 infrastructure is Cisco, our load balancers and security devices are generally NOT Cisco.  Practically all of our non-Cisco gear talks OSPF.  While today we use static routes on our security devices and load-balancers, distributing routes to these devices dynamically via OSPF would have payoffs in terms of automatic error recovery and ease of administration.",
