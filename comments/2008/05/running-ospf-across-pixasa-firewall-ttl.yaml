  html: In other words then, doing it with PIX in the middle instead of a router should
    work fine without the TTL issues?

  html: Here is another example where it only works with the PIX/ASA but not with
    a router.<BR/><BR/>Please refer to this URL from Cisco.<BR/><BR/>http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/vpndevc/ps2030/products_configuration_example09186a00804acfea.shtml<BR/><BR/>If
    you replace one end of the PIX/ASA with a Cisco router and doing the same IPSec
    tunnel with the OSPF neighbor statement, your adjancy still won't come up because
    you will get an error on the router saying the remote peer was not on a common
    subnet. <BR/><BR/>Cisco has done something in the ASA code to (I believe) waive
    the check on common subnet.

  html: ASA5505 is (with the very basic feature set) very cheap device to play with.
    It's handy platform to test sophisticated setup like this OSPF one.

  html: 'Ivan: ASA doesn''t decrement TTL with default config. If you need this you
    may use a map in service policy where you can order it to do it.'

  html: I tried running OSPF between 2 routers across a firewall, by establshing a
    GRE tunnel and running OSPF through it. This takes care of the Hello packets (they
    have a TTL of 1) also.<BR/><BR/>The only hitch is that the firewall must support
    the pass-through of GRE.<BR/><BR/>I was also looking for a solution to run the
    OSPF across a fiewwall without using a GRE tunnel. One can configure the connected
    interfaces (with the firewall in between behaving like a router) not to broadcast
    (in our case multicast) OSPF. But then this stops the Hello packets also.<BR/><BR/>Is
    there any way to sort of unicast the Hello packets across the Firewall? And to
    increase the TTL of Hello packets to more than 1? For me either might solve the
    issue to some extent.

  html: As I wrote in the post - the trick works because PIX/ASA does not decrease
    TTL, so OSPF packets with TTL=1 pass through it.
