  html: If you're inserting state into the network via devices/services such as   stateful
    firewalls and NAT, which require symmetrical routing *at a given area of the topology*,
    then, sure, you need to enforce traffic symmetry *in that particular area of the
    topology*.  But otherwise, it's generally inefficient and undesirable to try and
    engineer artificial symmetry, especially in networks which are larger than a handful
    of devices, where it's well-nigh impossible, even if it were desirable, which
    it isn't.  <BR/><BR/>To be clear, asymmetry, far from being considered a negative,
    is often *desirable*.

  html: in our case - when we deal with voice - asymmetrical routing is killing; it
    introduces Jitter as two ISP's cant be same (even if you have Managed MPLS from
    them). But generally, Asymmetrical routing on internet cause different peering
    issues and in-case you get stuck with such a problem, its very hard to solve it.

  html: 'Roland put it very well, so I don''t have much to add. I fully agree with
    his explanations.<BR/><BR/>Indeed, traffic demands in any realistic IP network
    are very often asymmetric in volume, i.e. A sends to B more that B to A. This
    is a natural asymmetry inherent in general purpose IP networks usage patterns.
    <BR/><BR/>On the side note: if a network carries *only* voice traffic, this argument
    doesn''t apply, since voice traffic matrices are almost perfectly symmetric.<BR/><BR/>Forcing
    artificial path symmetry onto network with sufficiently asymmetric traffic matrix
    would result in suboptimal resource utilization and possibly congestion on overloaded
    paths.<BR/><BR/>Sometimes, symmetric routing is *percieved* as easier to understand
    and troubleshoot, but in reality it doesn''t make much difference.<BR/><BR/>All
    in all, forced path symmetry, unless dictated by stateful network elements, doesn''t
    buy you much, but can lead to suboptimalities in your network. IMHO, routing symmetry
    per se is not a valid design goal, but optimal routing in terms of network utilization
    is.'

  html: yeah I have to agree with roland and dbg.  Well said guys.  I guess perception
    has a lot to do with it.  Symmetric anything is usually perceived as easier to
    understand and troubleshoot but the reality is that its not always possible.  In
    striving for symmetric routing you can over-engineer the network and actually
    make it more difficult to understand and troubleshoot.

  html: binary-zero - routing asymmetry isn't your problem.  Throughput/bandwidth/backhaul  asymmetry
    is your problem.

  html: asymmetric routing causes jitter, one way audio, packet loss and quality issues.
    You might find it useful under some circumstances for Data Traffic but it is a
    NO-NO on voice traffic.<br /><br />Cheers, UC

  html: I don&#39;t see how you could hope to achieve symmetrical routing over BGP,
    nor why if you are motivated by keeping costs down and staying employed.

  html: '@Guest above-- I know it&#39;s impossible to force symmetry, but I don&#39;t
    see why BGP prepending wouldn&#39;t handle the majority of multi-homed ISP scenarios?<br

  html: From my experience the multicast requires to pass RPF check - it is  required
    to have loop free multicast routing.<br />Another example is spoofinc prevention
    when we employ uRPF (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3704).<br />There are other
    examples like unknown MAC flooding when the asymmetric routing causes switch to
    flood unkwnon router MAC (HSRP environment with aymmetric routing).<br /><br />I
    do not think the aymmetric routing is completelly harmless if you do not have
    stateful elements on the path... It&#39;s much more complex problem when you deal
    with complex networks.<br />

  html: In addition to multicast RPF check, certain upper-layer protocols such as
    NTP or even applications (arguably design limitation or poorly written) are impacted
    by asymmetric routing, mainly due to the transit time difference between the two
    directions. Personally I would minimise asymmetric routing within administrative
    boundary, influence as much as possible the carriers or ISP to do the same, and
    accept that asymmetric routing is the norm out on the internet.
