But otherwise, it's generally inefficient and undesirable to try and engineer artificial symmetry, especially in networks which are larger than a handful of devices, where it's well-nigh impossible, even if it were desirable, which it isn't.  <BR/><BR/>To be clear, asymmetry, far from being considered a negative, is often *desirable*.",

      "html": "Roland put it very well, so I don't have much to add. I fully agree with his explanations.<BR/><BR/>Indeed, traffic demands in any realistic IP network are very often asymmetric in volume, i.e. A sends to B more that B to A. This is a natural asymmetry inherent in general purpose IP networks usage patterns. <BR/><BR/>On the side note: if a network carries *only* voice traffic, this argument doesn't apply, since voice traffic matrices are almost perfectly symmetric.<BR/><BR/>Forcing artificial path symmetry onto network with sufficiently asymmetric traffic matrix would result in suboptimal resource utilization and possibly congestion on overloaded paths.<BR/><BR/>Sometimes, symmetric routing is *percieved* as easier to understand and troubleshoot, but in reality it doesn't make much difference.<BR/><BR/>All in all, forced path symmetry, unless dictated by stateful network elements, doesn't buy you much, but can lead to suboptimalities in your network. IMHO, routing symmetry per se is not a valid design goal, but optimal routing in terms of network utilization is.",

Symmetric anything is usually perceived as easier to understand and troubleshoot but the reality is that its not always possible.  In striving for symmetric routing you can over-engineer the network and actually make it more difficult to understand and troubleshoot.",
