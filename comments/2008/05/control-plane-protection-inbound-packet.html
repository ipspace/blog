            <div class="comment-content">Thanks for the excellent post Ivan. I was surprised to read that if a policy is attached to the aggregate policy it would disable any control-plane subinterface policies. I didn't recall I read that caveat in the actual IOS CPPr config doc so this is an excellent piece of information.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan:<BR/><BR/>I just finished reading the Understanding CPPr Doc and found the following statement about CoPP interesting:<BR/><BR/>"Control Plane Policing: Control Plane Policing is a Cisco IOS feature that allows policing of traffic destined to the route processor. A packet will not be checked against the CPPr policy until it has been permitted by all configured forms of CoPP."<BR/><BR/>So if I interpret it right...it appears that you can have a CPPr policy on specific control-plane subinterface(s) provided that the policy attached to the control plane aggregate interface has allowed it to go through. <BR/><BR/>Also when I look at the flow diagram in that document the subinterfaces will be checked "after" the CoPP aggregate interface.<BR/><BR/>I found this confusing and wonder if you have read it as well.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">As soon as I've applied the aggregate policy (CoPP), the counters on the subinterface policies (CPPr) stopped increasing (or stayed at zero after being cleared). <BR/><BR/>I did not have the explicit 'class-default' in the aggregate policy, so I might do a few more tests. However, using 12.4(15)T5 the subinterface policies did not work at least for the traffic in the implicit default class of the aggregate policy.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I also ran similar tests...have a permit all policy attached to the aggregate interface and as soon as I did that the counter stopped incrementing. Next I tried a single permit say eigrp any any so I intentionally excluded OSPF under aggregate and that didn't help. The only time where it worked was that I had to remove the policy from the aggregate. <BR/><BR/>I will see if I can use the CPPr doc as a reference and ask my local SE to confirm. Stay tuned...</div>
