  html: Good point, I don't see an RSS feed or news link on that page.  However,  a
    person can subscribe to  News@Cisco (http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/rss.html)
    and MyNews@Ciscowire (http://tools.cisco.com/newsroom/contactSearch/jsp/myNewsWelcome.jsp)<BR/><BR/>It
    would be nice of Cisco to have links for RSS or new lists for content on this
    page.  Time to contact Cisco and make a suggestion.
