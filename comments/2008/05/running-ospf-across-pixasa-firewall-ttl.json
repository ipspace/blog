      "html": "I tried running OSPF between 2 routers across a firewall, by establshing a GRE tunnel and running OSPF through it. This takes care of the Hello packets (they have a TTL of 1) also.<BR/><BR/>The only hitch is that the firewall must support the pass-through of GRE.<BR/><BR/>I was also looking for a solution to run the OSPF across a fiewwall without using a GRE tunnel. One can configure the connected interfaces (with the firewall in between behaving like a router) not to broadcast (in our case multicast) OSPF. But then this stops the Hello packets also.<BR/><BR/>Is there any way to sort of unicast the Hello packets across the Firewall? And to increase the TTL of Hello packets to more than 1? For me either might solve the issue to some extent.",
