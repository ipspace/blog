  html: Thanks for sharing this. I especially liked the impact of, what the author
    called &quot;power dynamic&quot; which can severely impact dialogue and decision
    making. In my experience this is the biggest hurdle to take when dealing with
    architecture and design processes. Being an introvert myself dealing with this
    kind of dynamic makes it even more difficult from time to time.
