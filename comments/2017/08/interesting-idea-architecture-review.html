            <div class="comment-content">Thanks for sharing this. I especially liked the impact of, what the author called &quot;power dynamic&quot; which can severely impact dialogue and decision making. In my experience this is the biggest hurdle to take when dealing with architecture and design processes. Being an introvert myself dealing with this kind of dynamic makes it even more difficult from time to time.</div>
