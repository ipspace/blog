      "html": "As a CS major working most of the time as a Network Engineer, I&#39;ll take your offer to (partially) disagree :) <br /><br />To get into an &quot;advanced proficiency&quot; level in Network is harder to achieve than in software engineering, I would say. This for me is the level where Network engineers are aware of how packets move at the ASIC level and the architecture and protocols that allows the best outcomes. At the development side, is the level where you know and understand the best algorithms, where to apply them, complexities and caveats of each.<br /><br />But to really master each, the stakes are higher at the software engineering side. To claim that, one to be extremely proficient in his field of expertise (Network, Database, Filesystem, etc.) plus understand all the ways to make correct, efficient, sane, sustainable and secure code.",
