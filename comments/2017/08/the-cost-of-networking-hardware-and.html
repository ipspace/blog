            <div class="comment-content">This is quite misleading, since it is true only for the very low-end devices. <br />Even sub 10-kEUR routers may have unique ASIC chips inside doing the forwarding. Bigger routers are especially not just generic boxes, but rather with distributed processing in line cards. Also the high-end interfaces are not just generic hardware.<br />High accuracy time synchronization is more and more required. This also based on special time stamping hardware in the interface cards. <br />A generic x86 server is very far in capabilities from all these. Of course, for most of the SMB companies an x86 server might be more than enough, but large enterprise and service providers would need such special hardware architectures, that a generic x86 server would not provide.<br />However, white-boxing for data plane devices is possible and could lead a better cost structure...<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">While I agree with you in principle, your view of &quot;very low end&quot; is probably different from an enterprise architect&#39;s one.<br /><br />All routers were doing CPU-based packet forwarding till high-end AGS+, Cisco 7000 and ASRs (I&#39;m not going into high-speed service provider gear). Most routers (including all the ISRs) still do.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">If you looked at the financial numbers for most of the Vendor space here you will realise that, particularly in the SP Market Segment, the low end 1RU MPLS Access routers are where all the revenue numbers are coming from. Whilst not hugely profitable, their sheer numbers are what drives the costs down for the Core devices that are fewer in number, but share common hardware and software. For Most vendors, the chassis hardware is nothing more that the 1RU hardware with a switched back plane that enables the devices to scale. <br /><br />On the Enterprise side, the story is very similar, the reuse  of merchant silicon line card architectures can be seen from the 1RU to the 10 RU, in many cases the same hardware is reused in SP platforms with different operating systems.<br /><br />The simple fact is that the Open Compute Networking products have the ability to perform as well as most Vendor specific gear and it won&#39;t be long before some of those manufacturers  will look to expand those platforms into chassis architectures. <br /><br />This is what is forcing change in the large Vendors, and why dis-aggregation is important for them to change cultures both at the customer side and the internal sales/services side of the business. For some vendors that changes is going to take a long time, and there will likely be causalities along the way. <br /><br />From my perspective, for some Vendors in this space the changes is identical to what IBM had to go through when moving from being a hardware vendor to a Software and Solutions company.<br /><br />If you see vendors that don&#39;t have large services organisations, you might question how diversified they are in order to manage that transition.<br /><br />In a dis-aggregated world Services, Testing and Compliance become one of the most critical &amp; expensive deliverables.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">There are a lot of functions in networking that would need to satisfy hard real-time requirements. In many cases, that is easier to do in special hardware, then in hard real-time software. <br />Do not forget, that it is quite expensive to hire hard real-time software experts. Your average Linux or Windows programmer has no idea about hard real-time systems. How many programmers are available for operating systems like QNX or VxWorks? Very few...<br /><br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content"> Agree the purpose built ascis for certain platforms backplane and  line card control, dma, tcam and for (ipv6 sizes) caches/queues, ingress and egress virtual output queues, arbiters, parsers all controlled with a certain level of custom software or their &quot;hooks&quot;. Yes some  routers ran PowerPC CPUs. Yes you can run their software possibly on a brightbox/white box some PC.   VIOS, IOS on Linux or some of the VIRL images but performance or features won&#39;t be there.<br /><br />But for other vendors just as Ivan stated with F5 why the cost if the HW is just OTS and if the VA is close enough in terms of performance? Same with Bluecoat etc.<br /><br /> But back to Cisco, that was the Cisco premium customers are willing to pay for - their software baked to their hardware for optimal performance and one company to beat on for recourse if it didn&#39;t perform well.<br /><br />Well maybe a few of the bad vendors are like the proverbial car lot salesman and you don&#39;t know what&#39;s under the hood. Bring your mechanic.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&quot;one company to beat on&quot;<br /><br />You may expect that over time, all the network vendors will need to start providing certified and compliance tested revisions against specific Open Compute Network chassis. <br /><br />The &quot;one throat to choke&quot; offering will likely continue and be one of the main corner stones of the value position of these vendors. Unlike Cloud and Application Services, there continues to be a requirement for on premise network infrastructure, at both the SP and Enterprise level. That demand will continue to grow for most Tier 2 and below SP&#39;s. The infrastructure equipment is not their core business and there is limited value in maintaining an internal expertise in dis-aggregated software/hardware support lifecycles. The sheer lack of availability of resources will limit this to Tier 1 SP customers and a few selected Global Enterprises mainly in the OTT and IT businesses that have a need for scales of economy.<br /><br />It&#39;s also likely that those chassis may ship with Cisco/Juniper/Ericsson etc badges on them and be spared and distributed by the same supply channels.<br /><br />This is in effect one of the core values of the multinational network equipment vendor, the ability to spare and support a hardware device almost anywhere in the world.<br /><br />This is something that the white box equipment vendors don&#39;t appear to be that interested in since they don&#39;t gain a lot out of the process. The distribution of professional services and the hardware distribution chain is been heavily tied together. That may change over 2nd and 3rd generation cycles as those whitebox manufacturers look to grow and expand their offerings.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">It&#39;s not all about hardware.<br /><br />There is considerable cost to take monolithic, single thread/core software and making it scale across low-cost, multi-core platforms. Intel&#39;s DPDK is a great help, but there are still challenges in parallelizing network services like stateful connection tracking, in-order delivery, deep-packet inspection, fragmentation and reassembly, shaping, encryption, and so on. Plus, the software must take advantage of any available hardware offloads (SR-IOV, TCP RSS, Crypto, VMXNET3, CRC/checksum).<br /><br />Of course, it&#39;s worth the effort. Personally, I find it amazing that the exact same Cisco IOS-XE source code runs so well on hardware ASICs (ASR 1000), Intel CPUs (ISR 4000), and cloud (CSR 1000v) platforms.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">In not too distant past, x86 was also considered special hardware. People tend to forget hardware is finally hardware - whether it is designed for volume market or niche. Cost is what really matters irrespective of hw design. Most often control plane functions of big routers run on x86&#39;ish platforms while line card software run on ARM/PowerPC for power/heat considerations. Coming to data plane , packet forwarding software in x86 cant scale beyond 50G unless you do heavy duty optimization hacks. It is not about real time sodtware but this is limitations of general purpose processor architecture. When you need 1TBps througput , you need specialized ASIC   /FPGA . Even if you plug it to a x86 based board it still is  a special hardware design. Thats what Cisco and  others do quite frankly.</div>
