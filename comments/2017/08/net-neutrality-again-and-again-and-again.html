            <div class="comment-content">I am not sure I understand the problem you and Robert Graham describe. What you and him explain is actually ok in accordance to net neutrality rules. Let&#39;s use examples as it will be easier:<br /><br />1. An SP throttles down or caps users that consume a lot of bandwidth, regardless of the services the user consume. That&#39;s fine. You are not discriminating services or promoting your own services in detriments of other&#39;s.<br />2. An SP throttles down ALL video services, including their own, because they have terrible network and can&#39;t cope with that. That&#39;s fine as well. You are just a terrible SP, you are not trying to harm netflix in favor of your own service.<br />3. The example Robert gives about in-flight wifi. Completely fine again, you are limiting ALL high bandwidth services due to bandwidth limitations, you are not targetting netflix while allowing hulu, for instance.<br /><br />All those examples are fine according to net neutrality rules. What net neutrality is against is targeting specific services for commercial purposes. For example, comcast throttling down netflix so they can sell their own video service. Or comcast having a data cap and having a service that doesn&#39;t count against that data cap while other similar services do. Basically, what net neutrality is trying to prevent is two things:<br /><br />1. Having an SP taking advantage of the situation where they are both internet and content provider.<br />2. Having smaller companies unable to compete with bigger ones because bigger companies have agreements with telcos and their data doesn&#39;t count for the data cap while the smaller companies&#39; data does.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&quot;I am not sure I understand the problem you and Robert Graham describe.&quot; &lt;&lt; It looks like so many other things in networking &quot;net neutrality&quot; means different things to different people :(( <br /><br />Your definition of what it is makes perfect sense. I&#39;m also positive it&#39;s not what hard-core &quot;net neutrality advocates&quot; want to see.</div>
