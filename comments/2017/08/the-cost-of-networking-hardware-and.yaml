    html: While I agree with you in principle, your view of &quot;very low end&quot;
      is probably different from an enterprise architect&#39;s one.<br /><br />All
      routers were doing CPU-based packet forwarding till high-end AGS+, Cisco 7000
      and ASRs (I&#39;m not going into high-speed service provider gear). Most routers
      (including all the ISRs) still do.

    html: If you looked at the financial numbers for most of the Vendor space here
      you will realise that, particularly in the SP Market Segment, the low end 1RU
      MPLS Access routers are where all the revenue numbers are coming from. Whilst
      not hugely profitable, their sheer numbers are what drives the costs down for
      the Core devices that are fewer in number, but share common hardware and software.
      For Most vendors, the chassis hardware is nothing more that the 1RU hardware
      with a switched back plane that enables the devices to scale. <br /><br />On
      the Enterprise side, the story is very similar, the reuse  of merchant silicon
      line card architectures can be seen from the 1RU to the 10 RU, in many cases
      the same hardware is reused in SP platforms with different operating systems.<br
      /><br />The simple fact is that the Open Compute Networking products have the
      ability to perform as well as most Vendor specific gear and it won&#39;t be
      long before some of those manufacturers  will look to expand those platforms
      into chassis architectures. <br /><br />This is what is forcing change in the
      large Vendors, and why dis-aggregation is important for them to change cultures
      both at the customer side and the internal sales/services side of the business.
      For some vendors that changes is going to take a long time, and there will likely
      be causalities along the way. <br /><br />From my perspective, for some Vendors
      in this space the changes is identical to what IBM had to go through when moving
      from being a hardware vendor to a Software and Solutions company.<br /><br />If
      you see vendors that don&#39;t have large services organisations, you might
      question how diversified they are in order to manage that transition.<br /><br
      />In a dis-aggregated world Services, Testing and Compliance become one of the
      most critical &amp; expensive deliverables.

  html: This is quite misleading, since it is true only for the very low-end devices.
    <br />Even sub 10-kEUR routers may have unique ASIC chips inside doing the forwarding.
    Bigger routers are especially not just generic boxes, but rather with distributed
    processing in line cards. Also the high-end interfaces are not just generic hardware.<br
    />High accuracy time synchronization is more and more required. This also based
    on special time stamping hardware in the interface cards. <br />A generic x86
    server is very far in capabilities from all these. Of course, for most of the
    SMB companies an x86 server might be more than enough, but large enterprise and
    service providers would need such special hardware architectures, that a generic
    x86 server would not provide.<br />However, white-boxing for data plane devices
    is possible and could lead a better cost structure...<br />

  html: There are a lot of functions in networking that would need to satisfy hard
    real-time requirements. In many cases, that is easier to do in special hardware,
    then in hard real-time software. <br />Do not forget, that it is quite expensive
    to hire hard real-time software experts. Your average Linux or Windows programmer
    has no idea about hard real-time systems. How many programmers are available for
    operating systems like QNX or VxWorks? Very few...<br /><br />

    html: '&quot;one company to beat on&quot;<br /><br />You may expect that over
      time, all the network vendors will need to start providing certified and compliance
      tested revisions against specific Open Compute Network chassis. <br /><br />The
      &quot;one throat to choke&quot; offering will likely continue and be one of
      the main corner stones of the value position of these vendors. Unlike Cloud
      and Application Services, there continues to be a requirement for on premise
      network infrastructure, at both the SP and Enterprise level. That demand will
      continue to grow for most Tier 2 and below SP&#39;s. The infrastructure equipment
      is not their core business and there is limited value in maintaining an internal
      expertise in dis-aggregated software/hardware support lifecycles. The sheer
      lack of availability of resources will limit this to Tier 1 SP customers and
      a few selected Global Enterprises mainly in the OTT and IT businesses that have
      a need for scales of economy.<br /><br />It&#39;s also likely that those chassis
      may ship with Cisco/Juniper/Ericsson etc badges on them and be spared and distributed
      by the same supply channels.<br /><br />This is in effect one of the core values
      of the multinational network equipment vendor, the ability to spare and support
      a hardware device almost anywhere in the world.<br /><br />This is something
      that the white box equipment vendors don&#39;t appear to be that interested
      in since they don&#39;t gain a lot out of the process. The distribution of professional
      services and the hardware distribution chain is been heavily tied together.
      That may change over 2nd and 3rd generation cycles as those whitebox manufacturers
      look to grow and expand their offerings.'

  html: ' Agree the purpose built ascis for certain platforms backplane and  line
    card control, dma, tcam and for (ipv6 sizes) caches/queues, ingress and egress
    virtual output queues, arbiters, parsers all controlled with a certain level of
    custom software or their &quot;hooks&quot;. Yes some  routers ran PowerPC CPUs.
    Yes you can run their software possibly on a brightbox/white box some PC.   VIOS,
    IOS on Linux or some of the VIRL images but performance or features won&#39;t
    be there.<br /><br />But for other vendors just as Ivan stated with F5 why the
    cost if the HW is just OTS and if the VA is close enough in terms of performance?
    Same with Bluecoat etc.<br /><br /> But back to Cisco, that was the Cisco premium
    customers are willing to pay for - their software baked to their hardware for
    optimal performance and one company to beat on for recourse if it didn&#39;t perform
    well.<br /><br />Well maybe a few of the bad vendors are like the proverbial car
    lot salesman and you don&#39;t know what&#39;s under the hood. Bring your mechanic.'

  html: It&#39;s not all about hardware.<br /><br />There is considerable cost to
    take monolithic, single thread/core software and making it scale across low-cost,
    multi-core platforms. Intel&#39;s DPDK is a great help, but there are still challenges
    in parallelizing network services like stateful connection tracking, in-order
    delivery, deep-packet inspection, fragmentation and reassembly, shaping, encryption,
    and so on. Plus, the software must take advantage of any available hardware offloads
    (SR-IOV, TCP RSS, Crypto, VMXNET3, CRC/checksum).<br /><br />Of course, it&#39;s
    worth the effort. Personally, I find it amazing that the exact same Cisco IOS-XE
    source code runs so well on hardware ASICs (ASR 1000), Intel CPUs (ISR 4000),
    and cloud (CSR 1000v) platforms.

  html: In not too distant past, x86 was also considered special hardware. People
    tend to forget hardware is finally hardware - whether it is designed for volume
    market or niche. Cost is what really matters irrespective of hw design. Most often
    control plane functions of big routers run on x86&#39;ish platforms while line
    card software run on ARM/PowerPC for power/heat considerations. Coming to data
    plane , packet forwarding software in x86 cant scale beyond 50G unless you do
    heavy duty optimization hacks. It is not about real time sodtware but this is
    limitations of general purpose processor architecture. When you need 1TBps througput
    , you need specialized ASIC   /FPGA . Even if you plug it to a x86 based board
    it still is  a special hardware design. Thats what Cisco and  others do quite
    frankly.
