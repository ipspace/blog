    html: BFD is good for detection. BFD does nothing to help in speeding up the convergence
      time. In the case above, traffic would still be dropped as C1 has not yet had
      the full routing table (BGP has not converged)

  html: 'Good post, to understand some of the nuances when using multiple protocols
    and the sync knobs. Reminds me of ISIS overload bit setting same with Fabricpath
    so when the node recovers it can wait a bit before immediately converging. Lazy
    Question on my part can this also be done with the BFD options? '
