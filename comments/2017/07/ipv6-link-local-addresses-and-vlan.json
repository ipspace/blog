         "html": "I think much confusion comes from the distinction between &quot;ports&quot; and &quot;interfaces.&quot; To me, there is a significant difference between them. &quot;Ports&quot; are L2 forwarding entities where as &quot;interfaces&quot; are L3 forwarding entities (which contain IP addresses). This is why pretty much all 802.3 &amp; 802.1 IEEE stds use &quot;ports.&quot; But because Cisco first created routers back in the day, their CLI often treats them as synonyms (unfortunately). A VLAN interface can consist of multiple L2 ports. Spanning Tree can block 3 of 4 ports on a VLAN interface. If STP respans, you don&#39;t want an IP host to have to re-ARP. So as you said, an *interface* must be represented by a single MAC address for things like ARP. But, L2 protocols like STP, LACP, LLDP need to distinguish among a set of ports in the same broadcast domain to determine best paths, LAG members, and physical connections.",

Having dove in head first without much reading but going to town on some IPv6 configuration on alot of cisco IOS, addressing vlans with different LLA&#39;s does have interesting results, potentially makes it more complicated.
