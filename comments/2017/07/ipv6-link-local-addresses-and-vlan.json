      "html": "I think much confusion comes from the distinction between &quot;ports&quot; and &quot;interfaces.&quot; To me, there is a significant difference between them. &quot;Ports&quot; are L2 forwarding entities where as &quot;interfaces&quot; are L3 forwarding entities (which contain IP addresses). This is why pretty much all 802.3 &amp; 802.1 IEEE stds use &quot;ports.&quot; But because Cisco first created routers back in the day, their CLI often treats them as synonyms (unfortunately). A VLAN interface can consist of multiple L2 ports. Spanning Tree can block 3 of 4 ports on a VLAN interface. If STP respans, you don&#39;t want an IP host to have to re-ARP. So as you said, an *interface* must be represented by a single MAC address for things like ARP. But, L2 protocols like STP, LACP, LLDP need to distinguish among a set of ports in the same broadcast domain to determine best paths, LAG members, and physical connections.",
