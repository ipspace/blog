          "html": "IMO, a local probe with some data buffering would be a good solution. Provide CPU, memory, and temp storage. It&#39;d be cheap to run one of those and I think is a good example of how a cloud service that supports infrastructure can be reliable enough with some decent software design.",

      "html": "Interesting ... I haven&#39;t read all documentation regarding this yet, but I _guess_ it makes sense to use properly encrypted and authenticated protocols with this... SNMPv3 (authpriv) is a must (although the security of pre-shared keys is discussable). <br />NetFlow is completely unencrypted and not authenticated. Does someone want to send this kind of data over an unsecured link.<br /><br />I didn&#39;t quite get the concept of &quot;remote probes&quot;, which are installed on premise. In case these are capable to collect SNMP and NetFlow data, the situation from above would be solved. However, local probe installation would be still needed (own servers on premise).<br /><br />Just my thoughts on this without knowing the product in detail :)<br /><br />",
