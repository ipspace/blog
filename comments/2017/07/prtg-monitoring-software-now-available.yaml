    html: IMO, a local probe with some data buffering would be a good solution. Provide
      CPU, memory, and temp storage. It&#39;d be cheap to run one of those and I think
      is a good example of how a cloud service that supports infrastructure can be
      reliable enough with some decent software design.

  html: Interesting ... I haven&#39;t read all documentation regarding this yet, but
    I _guess_ it makes sense to use properly encrypted and authenticated protocols
    with this... SNMPv3 (authpriv) is a must (although the security of pre-shared
    keys is discussable). <br />NetFlow is completely unencrypted and not authenticated.
    Does someone want to send this kind of data over an unsecured link.<br /><br />I
    didn&#39;t quite get the concept of &quot;remote probes&quot;, which are installed
    on premise. In case these are capable to collect SNMP and NetFlow data, the situation
    from above would be solved. However, local probe installation would be still needed
    (own servers on premise).<br /><br />Just my thoughts on this without knowing
    the product in detail :)<br /><br />

    html: How many &quot;serious&quot; companies are using Office 365 for their internal
      docs and email, Box or DropBox to share data with their suppliers, AWS to run
      their marketing campaigns, SalesForce to manage their sales channel, or Google
      Apps for Business or ... and why do we still need to discuss this by the end
      of 2017?

    html: You&#39;re probably right about that for most applications. Yet I doubt
      governments or government agencies would use another country&#39;s company&#39;s
      cloud to store their classified data in it.

  html: It was interesting reading all the pros and cons. Do you think a cloud application
    can be considered &#39;secure&#39;by any serious company?
