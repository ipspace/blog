  html: Very interesting thought. How about disable the sequence checking on the Firewalls
    (Ok we may loose AV &amp; IPS but let&#39;s suppose we don&#39;t need them). We
    give up stateful inspection, but this could be a solution without a real increase
    of the risk (I was also reading your related article http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/02/should-firewalls-track-tcp-sequence.html)<br
    /><br />State exchange could also be a solution with a rate limit on the number
    of sessions that could be synchronized (DDoS &amp; Big Scan would not be a problem).
    If the DCI link goes down (Split-Brain) everything will still working as in the
    case where there was no Firewall, this would not increase the risk.

  html: 'You could also move the firewall to the edge...I don&#39;t follow what happens
    lately in the industry but isn&#39;t this one of the promises of SDN / openflow
    / vmware NSX etc?  I think Cisco tried to scratch the area of integrating more
    brains in the switches with PISA SUP some years ago but it probably didn&#39;t
    work out. '

  html: As always - it&#39;s only a problem if it causes a problem for the business.
    Networkers, including myself, can get a bit &#39;OCD&#39; sometimes, performing
    IT for IT&#39;s sake, and crafting the network as if it was a sculpture. <br /><br
    />To be sure, the asymmetric flows could be classed as technical debt that makes
    troubleshooting harder during an issue. But that troubleshooting effort needs
    to be balanced against the effort and additional complexity that forced symmetry
    brings.

    html: 'Many customers/people just don&#39;t know the &quot;interesting&quot; traffic.
      Not everybode is Facebook or any other &quot;one&quot; content provider, exactely
      knowing what&#39;s interesting.<br />From my point of view in a &quot;normal&quot;
      latency network this kind of problem should not bother a normal behaving application. '

  html: Symmetric routing could be important for special applications such an RTT
    measurements based dynamic delay compensation.<br />The best solution is to move
    to a hybrid SDN architecture and just control the interesting traffic flows. <br
    />Based on the knowledge of the full topology you could select the same paths
    for both directions and then execute this policy in the network. <br />Of course,
    it has a price, so do it just for those flows where it is really necessary. <br

  html: 'Broad topic. Just to touch it. Same stateful device and different interfaces
    for ingress and egress paths is easy as long as both share the same security zones.
    Most devices have zone level policies (not interface level). Not hitting the same
    stateful device (ingress and egress traffic goes through different devices) can
    be sometimes solved by using HA clusters. The worst is when we do not hit the
    same HA cluster (different paths). It depends on topology. <br />No quick, general
    fixes. Disabling the tcp-syn check moves us to 90ties where we had to have acl
    for both direction because the returning traffic is  not automatically enabled.
    Not always acceptable. '
