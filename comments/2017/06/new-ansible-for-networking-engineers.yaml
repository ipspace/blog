    html: Short answers (more in a blog post in a few days):<br /><br />-&gt; Yes,
      you can upgrade<br />-&gt; The subscribers get discount off the regular course
      price, but not off the early bird pricing<br />-&gt; Yes, the &quot;Building
      Network Automation Solutions&quot; course is a superset of the Ansible course.

  html: Hey Ivan!<br /><br />Let&#39;s say I start doing the &quot;Ansible for Networking
    Engineers&quot; course, but later I decide I want more, and also want to do the
    &quot;Building Network Automation Solution&quot; course, is it possible to &quot;upgrade&quot;
    from one to the other?<br /><br />The issue is that at this time, I don&#39;t
    know if I will have time for the &quot;Building Network Automation Solution&quot;
    coming up in February 2018. At the same time, I don&#39;t want to wait until then,
    and may be make use of the time I do have before February for the &quot;Ansible
    for Networking Engineers&quot; course.<br /><br />Also is there any discount for
    subscribers for the &quot;Building Network Automation Solution&quot; course other
    than the early bird discount?<br /><br />Lastly, does the &quot;Building Network
    Automation Solution&quot; course automatically also include all the contents of
    &quot;Ansible for Networking Engineers&quot; course, while also including the
    additional benefits (i.e. system architecture, version control, testing and continuous
    integration, live sessions, guest speakers, etc.)?<br /><br />Thanks :)
