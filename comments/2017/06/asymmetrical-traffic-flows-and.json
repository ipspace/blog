      "html": "Very interesting thought. How about disable the sequence checking on the Firewalls (Ok we may loose AV &amp; IPS but let&#39;s suppose we don&#39;t need them). We give up stateful inspection, but this could be a solution without a real increase of the risk (I was also reading your related article http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/02/should-firewalls-track-tcp-sequence.html)<br /><br />State exchange could also be a solution with a rate limit on the number of sessions that could be synchronized (DDoS &amp; Big Scan would not be a problem). If the DCI link goes down (Split-Brain) everything will still working as in the case where there was no Firewall, this would not increase the risk.",

I think Cisco tried to scratch the area of integrating more brains in the switches with PISA SUP some years ago but it probably didn&#39;t work out. ",

Networkers, including myself, can get a bit &#39;OCD&#39; sometimes, performing IT for IT&#39;s sake, and crafting the network as if it was a sculpture. <br /><br />To be sure, the asymmetric flows could be classed as technical debt that makes troubleshooting harder during an issue. But that troubleshooting effort needs to be balanced against the effort and additional complexity that forced symmetry brings.",

      "html": "Symmetric routing could be important for special applications such an RTT measurements based dynamic delay compensation.<br />The best solution is to move to a hybrid SDN architecture and just control the interesting traffic flows. <br />Based on the knowledge of the full topology you could select the same paths for both directions and then execute this policy in the network. <br />Of course, it has a price, so do it just for those flows where it is really necessary. <br />",

      "html": "Broad topic. Just to touch it. Same stateful device and different interfaces for ingress and egress paths is easy as long as both share the same security zones. Most devices have zone level policies (not interface level). Not hitting the same stateful device (ingress and egress traffic goes through different devices) can be sometimes solved by using HA clusters. The worst is when we do not hit the same HA cluster (different paths). It depends on topology. <br />No quick, general fixes. Disabling the tcp-syn check moves us to 90ties where we had to have acl for both direction because the returning traffic is  not automatically enabled. Not always acceptable. ",
