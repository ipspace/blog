I want to see real life IT use case where the automation is worth spending time on. The statement like: &quot;Do you still configure VLAN using CLI?&quot; does not convince me because for me more time is spent on deciding if the VLAN is really needed... For me automation was always related to the economy - the balance between effort spent on automation and saved time...",

Contact me via email if you&#39;d like to get a draft version.<br /><br />As for &quot;time spent&quot; - you won&#39;t cut down on the design/impact analysis time, unless you go for orchestrated infrastructure where users can request VLANs on demand with no additional justification/analysis. However, even if you automate non-self-service processes, you get consistency, and (sometime) deployment in real time once you manage to persuade everyone involved that the risk of outage is low enough.<br /><br />The &quot;are you still configuring VLANs&quot; question is there to trigger a discussion (see, mission accomplished) and prompt people to start considering why they&#39;re still doing something so boring and fundamental using a manual process.<br /><br />Makes sense?",

Automation is not something you need to be talked to do. Automation is rather a need (the problem is first, before the solution). In 90ties  I automated some log collecting / config changing on 700+ routers using TeraTerm (funnyY). Because the need of doing it was clear. Also in my current job we automate a lot of system provisioning tasks both for avoiding mistakes (here we agree) and for repeatable task (repeatable).<br /><br />So I am really interested how it looks like in the pure IT field. <br /><br />PS. I am the guy you wrote to during the &quot;ipspace content leak affair&quot; (legal subscriber and your fan)",

      "html": "I work in the system development area where the automation has been always used - either for system testing &amp; validation or system deployment where depending on the option selected by the User some system components are automatically added / configured / deployed (I mean right device configuration is enforced).<br />The crucial thing is: we automate typical tasks from the pre-defined task repository (task is related to adding / removing part of a system).<br />------<br />But I guess the IT is somewhat different. If you could share some examples from the IT world where automation really helps. I would like to understand broader context as the automation (I guess) is just a part of the change we want to do in the system. Someone needs to decide what to do, someone needs to accept the change and finally the automation is used. <br />I ask the question because (for me) the final part of of this process is not as important as the decision about change, risk analysis, mitigation plan, etc.<br />That&#39;s why I wonder how the automation itself improves the overall process - as I do not understand the IT processes, the automation is a buzzword for me. From system development perspective automation is fine as the task we automate are well-define and carefully prepared in advance. The automation &#39;gain&#39; comes from repeatibility of the same task which was carefully thought earlier.",
