      "html": "Hey Ivan!<br /><br />Let&#39;s say I start doing the &quot;Ansible for Networking Engineers&quot; course, but later I decide I want more, and also want to do the &quot;Building Network Automation Solution&quot; course, is it possible to &quot;upgrade&quot; from one to the other?<br /><br />The issue is that at this time, I don&#39;t know if I will have time for the &quot;Building Network Automation Solution&quot; coming up in February 2018. At the same time, I don&#39;t want to wait until then, and may be make use of the time I do have before February for the &quot;Ansible for Networking Engineers&quot; course.<br /><br />Also is there any discount for subscribers for the &quot;Building Network Automation Solution&quot; course other than the early bird discount?<br /><br />Lastly, does the &quot;Building Network Automation Solution&quot; course automatically also include all the contents of &quot;Ansible for Networking Engineers&quot; course, while also including the additional benefits (i.e. system architecture, version control, testing and continuous integration, live sessions, guest speakers, etc.)?<br /><br />Thanks :)",
