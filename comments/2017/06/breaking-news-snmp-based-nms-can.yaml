  html: You can do some of the stuff SDN does, but not all. This is probably because  our
    lack of imagination rather than limitations of SDN

  html: 'Q: &quot;Why are our networks still not fully automated after all this time?&quot;<br
    />A: For most people &quot;not in IT business&quot; the &quot;call a contractor
    to do it&quot; is pretty much the equivalent of automation. Besides, you can yell
    &quot;just make the damn thing work&quot; to a human contractor, but not to an
    automation tool !<br /><br />For those that do handle some IT internally (lower
    the use of contractors) there&#39;s the balance between getting random things
    done fast and working on automation, but it will need some time before that balance
    get to the correct point.... like the time to get rid of all &quot;network guys&quot;
    that never learned how to write a line of code - and there&#39;s armies of them.'

  html: 'SDN architecture has different aspects and automation is just one of them.
    You can/could possibly perform some level of network management and automation
    with SNMP but how complex would that be? do all vendors support the same level
    of SNMP functionality? '

  html: 'At a previous job I worked at (the IP Division of Alcatel-Lucent, now Nokia)
    we had a fully SNMP-based NMS for the 7x50 series IP/MPLS routers, complete with
    a fully functional SOAP API (it was called the 5620 SAM).<br /><br />It had it&#39;s
    quirks but to date I&#39;ve never seen anything quite like it. I saw many customers
    who&#39;s primary interaction with their ALU IP/MPLS network was through this
    tool and it&#39;s API, including things like doing mass-provisioning of leased
    lines and subscriber profiles. <br /><br />The pattern I noticed however was customers
    would use it to automate a few specific things  (i.e. provision customer circuits,
    run audits) but wouldn&#39;t bother with full config management and deployment
    of their network. I.e. they would solve their 80% and ignore the rest. Depending
    on the customer and their business needs it&#39;s hard to argue against that choice.
    <br /><br />So, I would argue that yes, this is possible and in some specific
    sectors it has produced decent automation results. But this was due to pure business
    need: provisioning a ton of highly repeatable services that make money quickly
    and accurately.'

  html: Network management is the over the water part of the ice-berg in SDN. As an
    example, if you look at SD-WAN as one of the use cases of SDN, you will quickly
    realize that the intelligent management of WAN links in real-time wrt to applications
    flows is going way deeper than just simple network management. Yes, &quot;automation&quot;
    is still the key term here, but the granularity that automation is applied can
    be drastically different.
