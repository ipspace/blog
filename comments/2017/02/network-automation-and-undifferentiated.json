      "html": "IMO, the &quot;run this command on all devices&quot; is the easy part.  It always has been.  What is a little more tricky and much more interesting are things like:<br /><br />&quot;Enable dhcp snooping on every switch that has vlan 123 or 456 on it and automatically trust any uplink trunk port&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Add vlan 789 to any trunk port on the network that currently has 456&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Migrate to HSRP by swapping out current $ip with $ip+1 and making $ip the standby address but only after verifying that $ip+1 is not already in use.  And do the same thing on the other device but use $ip+2 instead.&quot;",
