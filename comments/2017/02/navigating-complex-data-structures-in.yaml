  html: "Great article<br />You said: &quot;writing a Python module (Jinja2 filter\
    \ or Ansible plugin) that transforms data is often easier than using a Jinja2\
    \ template&quot;<br />Absolutely agreed to that. <br /><br /><br />And there is\
    \ one more way to transform any input data to a data structure that ansible could\
    \ loop over. <br />Instead of running playbooks with a text-based inventory file\
    \ (-i ./hosts) you can run it with something executable (-i acl2ansible_json.py)<br\
    \ />They call it dynamic inventory feature:<br />http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/dev_guide/developing_inventory.html<br\
    \ /><br />But this feature can broke a text based model driven paradigm off to\
    \ something else \uFFFD\uFFFD"
