    html: 'Single point of management: sort-of (actually two points in redundant setup).
      It&#39;s also single point of fat-finger mistake ;)<br /><br />Cost: That&#39;s
      purely vendor licensing decision. I doubt the hardware is much cheaper.<br /><br
      />Wiring: identical to 2-spine leaf-and-spine fabric. Nobody said a leaf-and-spine
      fabric must have 4 spines.'

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /> Nice article. Doesnt the fabric extender technology has the
    below advantage s over leaf-spine architecture. Please correct me if I am wrong<br
    /> ==&gt; Single point of management (I do understand there are ACI and similar
    technologies which provide the same benefit)<br /> ==&gt; Cost.<br /> ==&gt;Wiring.
    [As you increase the number of spines in leaf-spine, need to add additional cables
    to all the existing leafs right. Obviously with fabric extenders we wont be able
    to increase the bandwidth beyond the number of uplinks on the fex]

  html: nobody seems to have commented on the limited buffers of the FEXes and the
    poor effect the buffer limitations has on very bursty traffic  such as storage
    traffic.

  html: You are making things too complex.  You don&#39;t need to do L3 or &quot;a
    L2 fabric using TRILL, SPB, VXLAN or whatever.&quot;  Just use Spanning Tree and
    have it shut down three of your four uplinks.  <br /><br />Oh, wait, it&#39;s
    not the 90&#39;s anymore.  Yet we still have Spanning Tree in a lot of what we
    do.  Play sad trombone sound here.<br /><br />Maybe we should give SPB and TRILL
    another chance.<br />
