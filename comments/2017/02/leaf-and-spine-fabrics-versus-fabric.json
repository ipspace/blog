I doubt the hardware is much cheaper.<br /><br />Wiring: identical to 2-spine leaf-and-spine fabric. Nobody said a leaf-and-spine fabric must have 4 spines.",

      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /> Nice article. Doesnt the fabric extender technology has the below advantage s over leaf-spine architecture. Please correct me if I am wrong<br /> ==&gt; Single point of management (I do understand there are ACI and similar technologies which provide the same benefit)<br /> ==&gt; Cost.<br /> ==&gt;Wiring. [As you increase the number of spines in leaf-spine, need to add additional cables to all the existing leafs right. Obviously with fabric extenders we wont be able to increase the bandwidth beyond the number of uplinks on the fex]",

You don&#39;t need to do L3 or &quot;a L2 fabric using TRILL, SPB, VXLAN or whatever.&quot;  Just use Spanning Tree and have it shut down three of your four uplinks.  <br /><br />Oh, wait, it&#39;s not the 90&#39;s anymore.  Yet we still have Spanning Tree in a lot of what we do.  Play sad trombone sound here.<br /><br />Maybe we should give SPB and TRILL another chance.<br />",
