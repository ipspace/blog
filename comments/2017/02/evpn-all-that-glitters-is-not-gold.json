Did I mention there would also be peace on earth? ;)<br /><br />It can be difficult enough to have different types of optics to talk to each other. Is Ethernet always Ethernet? Yes, mostly but there are things to consider there as well. How good is inter-op in MPLS? Works, mostly, probably.<br /><br />Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like EVPN but sometimes even running protocols within the same vendor is challenging. An RFC can always be interpreted in different ways. When we do interop we often have to settle on getting the common features working which is less than either device might be capable of.<br /><br />Another concern is that if everyone started building networks exactly the same with exactly the same components. What would happen the next time we see something like Intel SOC issue? The consequences would be disastrous. So while some ideas are nice in theory not everyone can use them and too much homogenity would not be good.<br /><br />Think you have some good blogging material above :)",

Tens of thousands of customers world-wide want thousands of different protocols, different flavors, different behaviour, and different knobs.<br /><br />I&#39;ll give you a basic example: MPLS. There are customers who insist on solving every problem with MPLS. And then there are other customers who insist on keeping MPLS out of their network at all costs. What is a vendor supposed to do ? If they want to make a living, the only solution is to implement all those protocols and knobs. Or else they will have very few customers. Can you blame them ?",

I remember some years back, ok, many years back where a customer of mine tried to build a multi-vendor STP-based network. The efforts of training the staff in the little differences and potential down-time because of misunderstanding was outperforming the initial financial attractiveness.<br /><br />There are significant efforts to make protocols interoperable. How long did it take to get MPLS working between multiple vendors? Jeff and Ivan can probably write a book about it :-)<br /><br />EVPN is still in its early days. While some vendors ship products for 2 or 3 years, many others just started the journey. The original contributors to EVPN had different use-cases in mind and so different implementation have been chosen, all compliant to the IETF RFCs or drafts.<br />For the record: Symmetric/Asymmetric IRB is one of the differences and there are reasons why one was chosen over the other. There are others variations in implementation that exists and all are compliant to the RFC/drafts.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I\u2019m working for Cisco and I\u2019m very involved with the EVPN solution ",
