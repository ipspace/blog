I have been playing with Parallel SSH for the the past few days and really like it to the point where I&#39;m writing a blog post about it. With a single command and without installing any automation tools, PSSH allows you to run a single or multiple commands on all devices:<br /><br />pssh -h hosts -l cisco -A &quot;wr mem&quot;",
