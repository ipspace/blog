      "html": "&quot;Looks like a stub interface (OSPF-enabled interface with no neighbors on it) doesn\u2019t satisfy the intra-area or inter-area path criteria. A2 thus ignores the Type-5 LSA pointing to its directly connected interface.&quot;<br /><br />Actually, if you change the area of the interface to non-stub, LSA5 route is installed in RIB. So probably the issue here is that the FA is reachable via stub area (which is impossible) and there is no corresponding LSA7 for that. ",
