      "html": "Hi Dinesh/Ivan<br /><br />If BGP uses interface instead of neighbor IP,do we specialy introduce a new configuration for identifying interface names. Current devices have interface names as 4/51 or such like that , how do we achieve interface naming conventions in router world . In Server Qagga world it looks easy. <br /><br />ASP path length and ASN numbers are two different attributes in choosing BGP Path chosing. <br /><br />Making a decision based on AS path length and making a desicion based on AS path numbers are two different scenarios. <br /><br />AS path length is default one. Policies match AS path numbers for actual mulltipathing. Which is a viable solution. <br /><br />DO we peer Public ASN with Private ASN peering in any scenario inside BGP. ",
