    html: The design has been contributed to OCP, there&#39;s variety of ASIC vendors
      as well as ODMs the switches are available from.<br />BCM SDK as the name suggests
      is the property of BCM and can&#39;t be made public by a 3rd party (that&#39;s
      why we all have signed NDA&#39;s)
