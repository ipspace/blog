    html: Hi Daniel..<br /><br />Now you are talking about the old rosy &quot;vendor
      lock-in&quot; ....<br /><br />I know many networks here in denmark that have
      gone with a vendor / technology to circumvent vendor lock-in and they all end
      up with a mess of hacks and instability.<br /><br />From my point of view vendor
      lock-in is great as long as you build networks and compute like &quot;lego pods&quot;
      ... Some pods running blue lego others pods run green lego.<br />All glued together
      with a fairly well tested multi vendor protocol vanilla BGP.

    html: Yes, exactly. That&#39;s how we have built networks for years and it works.<br
      /><br />I guess my point is that it will never make sense to build a leaf &amp;
      spine topology consisting of Cisco, Juniper, Arista and Brocade all in the same
      topology. They would be different parts of the network and interconnected in
      some way. Different pods as you say.

  html: This is exactly why I don&#39;t buy into the rosy, shiny world of where everyone
    thinks that the entire network will be orchestrated and automated to the final
    piece of config on a plethora of vendors and it will all do interop beautifully!
    Did I mention there would also be peace on earth? ;)<br /><br />It can be difficult
    enough to have different types of optics to talk to each other. Is Ethernet always
    Ethernet? Yes, mostly but there are things to consider there as well. How good
    is inter-op in MPLS? Works, mostly, probably.<br /><br />Don&#39;t get me wrong,
    I like EVPN but sometimes even running protocols within the same vendor is challenging.
    An RFC can always be interpreted in different ways. When we do interop we often
    have to settle on getting the common features working which is less than either
    device might be capable of.<br /><br />Another concern is that if everyone started
    building networks exactly the same with exactly the same components. What would
    happen the next time we see something like Intel SOC issue? The consequences would
    be disastrous. So while some ideas are nice in theory not everyone can use them
    and too much homogenity would not be good.<br /><br />Think you have some good
    blogging material above :)

    html: 'Ivan wrote: &quot;talk with those vendors and ask them why they want to

      answer is pretty simple. Tens of thousands of customers world-wide want thousands
      of different protocols, different flavors, different behaviour, and different
      knobs.<br /><br />I&#39;ll give you a basic example: MPLS. There are customers
      who insist on solving every problem with MPLS. And then there are other customers
      who insist on keeping MPLS out of their network at all costs. What is a vendor
      supposed to do ? If they want to make a living, the only solution is to implement
      all those protocols and knobs. Or else they will have very few customers. Can
      you blame them ?'

    html: Henk, I understand that (and immensely hate that reality), but there&#39;s
      a difference between &quot;having to support all these protocols because customers&quot;
      and &quot;you MUST deploy PIM and IGP to run my variant of EVPN&quot;.<br /><br
      />The right answer would be &quot;you COULD run EVPN on top of IBGP on top of
      IGP and use PIM to build multicast trees but you COULD also run EVPN with EBGP
      and source-node replication if you want to keep your DC fabric simple&quot;

    the permutations and and communication between BGP/RIB/LM/bridge components, rate-limiters
    and new SM&#39;s, since  CP =! FW. Huge amount of work on HW, workarounds for

    a fully functional code base.   '

    html: 'If we assume that IETF draft is some approximation of the respective implementations,
      then &quot;asymmetric&quot; side potentially might accept the routes and this
      information would be sufficient. &quot;Symmetric&quot; side would miss information
      required for L3 forwarding (and they promises to drop the route).<br /><br />On
      the data plane traffic from &quot;asymmetric&quot; to &quot;symmetric&quot;
      should have no problem (assuming route is accepted). &quot;Symmetric&quot; could
      have forwarded L2 traffic (but choose to drop route on contol plane), but L3
      forwarding will definitely fail route lookup.<br /><br />It might be possible
      to do &quot;asymmetric&quot; routing on spine switches with something else in
      pure L2 mode as leaf nodes. But this is not exactly &quot;interoperability&quot;,
      it is simply one of the properties of &quot;asymmetric&quot; implementation. '

  html: Does anyone saw working EVPN+VXLAN implementation between Cisco (N9K) and
    Juniper (QFX10K and 5110)? I&#39;m preparing for such a POC and constantly I&#39;m
    assured by both vendors representatives that there is a little to zero chance
    it will be working altogether. There is a plethora of differences in EVPN implementation
    of both about which I&#39;m aware but still didn&#39;t have a chance to saw WORKING
    solution between both of these vendors.

    html: Yes, they have symmetric IRB now (at least on QFX10K, ask your SE about
      the other platforms), and yes, it seems most things work (at least in the interoperability
      lab).<br /><br />Based on what I&#39;ve heard from someone who tried to deploy
      pretty complex EVPN setup on QFX10K with an early version of the code, test
      everything you want to use before committing to a deployment.
