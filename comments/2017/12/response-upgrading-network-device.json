      "html": "When you deliver systems, particulary to the goverment Customers, you need your frimware to be compliant with all security requirements (features &amp; security bug fixes). Usually vendors integrate security fixes in the latest &amp; greatest release. So the firmware stability often suffers.<br /><br />From my perspective this is the main driver to upgrade the firmware - security, not the feature reachness.",

      "html": "I worked at Cisco for a little while a few years ago. The process for recommending IOS versions to customers was based on most stable and most deployed version (across customer base). Most often, the stable and most deployed version was typically 6-12 month old, sometimes even older. OS version upgrades for customers who had Advanced Services contract with Cisco were processed through a risk analysis tool, which looked at the features being used by the customer, features required, and the known bugs associated with the version being proposed. All-in-all, it was quite a process! Now, as a customer, things have been slightly different with NX-OS, but, generally, unless a critical feature is required, we stick to the &quot;Recommended&quot; version (varies with platform) - which tends to be 4-12 months old as well.",

      "html": "Regarding engineering releases, I can only speak from my experience:<br />They go thru a Cisco-internal process where the decision is made _if_ an engineering special will be created (criteria are most likely the customer, magnitude of the issue, ETA of the regular bugfix release, effort for the engineering special, ...)<br />If you get one, it will come with a &quot;big sticker&quot; telling you basically it will fix your special issue but might break &quot;everything else&quot; and you&#39;ll have to move to a regular release asap.<br />Engineering releases are more or less completely untested except for the bugfix, at least from what I believe to know...",
