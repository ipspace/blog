            <div class="comment-content">Why not going /127/8 for each host? Why to waste such a large segment for a p2p connection?<br />With a summary from the access layer wlc vpn or access switch. And get rid of all this complexity </div>

            <div class="comment-content">IPv6 comes in two deployments scenario one is Edge ISP aka Tier 3 ISP facing End Host scenario where generally IPv6 goes with DHCPv6 or DHCPv6 PD Prefix Delegation to the end hosts at the FHR scenario.<br /><br />IPv6 in DCs goes with SLAAC to the servers where we dont need DNS entries to the servers.<br /><br />Going with DHCPv6 PD on Edge ISPs and First Hop Router  ( FHR ) announce /128 to the end hosts which is ideal scenario for DHCPv6.<br /><br />Using SLAAC and assigning /64 for each end host would be a waste of an IPv6 Space and the reason would be to differentiate the IPv6 end host to assign B.W rate and QOS/ACL policies via DHCPv6 PD Options configured from the BRAS server.<br /><br />Prefix Delegation would assign a bigger prefix /48 to the First Hop Router and from there it will assign /64 to each host for convenience and to assign QOS /ACL policy and that is also being deployed.<br /><br />The best practise or the way to look forward would be to assign /128 prefix via SLAAC using /64 prefix per site and not per host following the DC practice in assigning /128 per host using SLAAC where the hosts connected to the same Access Point/FHR/ in both Wireless Access Point or Wired Lines where ISPs get PD assigned from a bigger pool.<br /><br />Using SLAAC or DHCPv6 is again it depends on the use case. Usually ISPs prefer DHCPv6 PD [ extension to DHCPv6] <br /><br />DHCPv6 without PD gets smaller prefix length /64 and assign host address from the pool using manually assigned cluster files which assigns IPv6 based on Source MAC or any DHCpv6 Options.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">According to Geoff Houston:<br /><br />&quot;If we really needed v6 like we need water, we would’ve died of thirst years ago&quot; He argues that IPv4 and NAT are serving us just fine, and could serve us well for another couple of decades. There is no quick way out of the mess because what we thought we needed 20 years ago has now changed completely.<br /><br />With regards to IPv6 address waste, he mentions that after slicing and dicing IPv6 addresses in large blocks per host, rather than thinking the &quot;IPv4 way&quot; of using /128 per host/link, we really don&#39;t gain the huge number of IPv6 addresses as we may have initially thought. However, back to the point - I get the fact that ISP&#39;s need to uniquely identify an endpoint with a registered device... and searching through loads of NAT logs, etc and correlating it to some sort of date/time is not very fun. <br /><br />Ivan, I hope you don&#39;t mind me throwing in a link to some IPv6 discussion from the PacketPushers podcast, but I found this one particularly useful for this topic.<br /><br />http://packetpushers.net/podcast/podcasts/show-275-future-of-networking-geoff-huston/<br /></div>
