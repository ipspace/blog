    html: It might be relevant (based on you plugging Azure products in another comment)
      to mention that you work in an Azure data center, and that whatever you guys
      are doing doesn&#39;t necessarily apply to 99.9% of environments. <br /><br
      />Also, RFC 1925 Rule 4 works both ways - it&#39;s impossible to understand
      why some people seemingly overcomplicate their networks until you&#39;re faced
      with their needs and requirements.

  html: 'Why do we want to run an overlay on a dc fabric network if we can route traffic
    from servwrs based on regional redundanr model.<br />I understand each instance
    of vm are attached to a vlan/vxlan and each vlan or vxlan has a overlay to the
    fabr8c egress .<br /><br />Network Infra is shared but network service is dedicated
    wrt to condigurations and service handling.<br /><br />What are the benefits of
    vxlan/vlan solutionand running each instance of vm in a vrf<br /><br />Isis is
    ised to run routing v4/v6 multicast routes as well in afo ( avaya fabric orchestartor
    ) '

    html: Stock exchange feeds. I&#39;ve heard that&#39;s a big deal in some environments.<br
      /><br />Cluster member discovery. Supposedly that&#39;s also a big deal in environments
      that haven&#39;t discovered configuration management.<br /><br />Distributed
      storage as implemented by people who still think we&#39;re working with thick
      yellow cable. See http://blog.ipspace.net/2017/11/lets-pretend-we-run-distributed-storage.html

  html: Cluster switch discovery or the server clustering  using mutlicast.<br /><br
    />BGP dynamic discovery on both remote ip and asn .<br /><br />Remote ip range
    and asn range is possible.<br /><br />Server clustering on the tor will be a good
    use case.

  html: Map reduce feature would solve. Avaya use case is more on doing mcast upstream
    switch discovery and plug n play isis .
