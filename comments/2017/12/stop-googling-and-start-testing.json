          "html": "A decade ago, I challenged my coworkers to come up with an IOS config for transparent interception, so that HTTP from any source to any destination  is &quot;proxied&quot; to one specific host. With IOS, this means applying both client source PAT and server destination NAT (rotary pool) to the same flow, a tricky feat since those functions have inverted ideas about NAT &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot;. I was expecting a solution that did each NAT function in its own VRF, with inter-VRF traffic being manhandled over a crossover cable.<br /><br />But one clever fellow combined  &quot;ip nat enable&quot; for the client source PAT and &quot;ip nat inside|outside&quot; for the server destination NAT on the same pair of interfaces. It was an elegant, single hop, single VRF solution that was completely consistent with the NAT order-of-operation and, as far as I&#39;m concerned, is fully supported by TAC!",

      "html": "If you tested and it worked this is no way an indication that it is supported.<br /><br />Read documentation, especially Restrictions and Limitations sections, before putting anything in production deployment. Google is very efficient way to navigate vendors documentation that spans multiple unconnected or unlinked documents. If can&#39;t find an answer - open a ticket with your vendor to clarify specify SW/HW combo features/limitations.<br /><br />The prime abusement is &#39;ip nat enable&quot;; were folks use it as a replacement for &#39;ip nat inside/outside&#39;. If both are working in the global routing table does not mean that both are supported. So, when something fails in production, after &#39;about 15 seconds&#39; of testing in the lab, then network redesign might be the only option.",
