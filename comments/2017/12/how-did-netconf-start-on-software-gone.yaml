  html: Haven&#39;t listened to it yet, but great idea! I was there when it started
    (including its pre-history at IETF, RFC 3535). The way in which Phil and his colleagues
    at Juniper shared their concept in the Netconf effort was an incredible contribution
    to the community. And they handled the unavoidable (even at IETF) committee-driven
    &quot;improvements&quot; (well a few probably were...) with such selfless elegance
    it almost drives me to tears even now :-) Huge respect!

  html: 'Back from listening to this very good podcast. As expected, everything Phil
    says is interesting and extremely clearly expressed. I would also like to say
    he&#39;s totally right about everything, but there was one thing I have doubts.
    That&#39;s the idea that when you stream telemetrics &quot;from the hardware&quot;
    you can&#39;t use TCP. (That was Cisco&#39;s position over in the IPFIX WG, and
    though I really tried very hard to let me be convinced by them, I never managed
    to accept that. Maybe they (and Phil) are right, but at least in this case I&#39;d
    be in good company (Van Jacobson&#39;s). Yes, it&#39;s harder with TCP, but it&#39;s
    worth the effort.)<br />So: 100% of what Phil says in the podcast is super interesting
    and clear, (at least ;-) 99.8% of it is also right on the mark.'
