            <div class="comment-content">It would be better if OS APIs were providing a way to connect to a DNS name directly instead of having to connect to a single IP, then it would be up to the OS to try, or not, to reach every IP that are resolved for the particular DNS name. Then it could benefit to all application. If we move complexity to application then it means every application owner have to handle such complexity while OSI Layers are here to provide service to upper layer.<br />TCP provide reliable connection to all application using it, application developer doesn&#39;t have to take care of reliability of packets, so another &quot;common service&quot; provided by OS could be to avoid the connectivity failure by trying all IPs of a DNS entry.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Completely agree with you, that&#39;s why I included a link to this one http://blog.ipspace.net/2009/08/what-went-wrong-socket-api.html in the blog post. Some operating systems and languages do have such APIs. No idea how good they are.</div>
