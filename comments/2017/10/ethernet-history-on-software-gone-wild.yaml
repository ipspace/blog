  html: "Hi Ivan<br />The podcast Ethernet History on Software Gone Wild from 28OCT17\
    \ took me down lovely trip down memory lane for the 80s and 90\u2019s. I used\
    \ to work with IEEE 802.4 systems as part of Industrial Automation, for a company\
    \ called MODICON  (later they merged with Schneider Automation) back in the day,\
    \ with something called Modbus Plus. I have even been able to find a manual from\
    \ 2004 hxxp://www.bh-automation.com/Download/Resources/ModBus-Plus-Planning-And-Installation-Guide.pdf\
    \ and another one from 2012 hyyp://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Reference=1755869&amp;p_EnDocType=User%20guide&amp;p_File_Id=27613538&amp;p_File_Name=ATV71_Modbus_plus_EN_1755869_03.pdf\
    \ . While there we also used a multi-drop coaxial based \u201Cnetworking systems\u201D\
    \ for remote I/O drops system based on a 1.544 Mbit/s Manchester encoded \u201C\
    backbone\u201D.<br /><br />In the early days with my first foray into Ethernet\
    \ Networking in the 90\u2019s  I even remember multiport 10base2 Hubs like these\
    \  http://ethercom.com/products/hubs-repeaters/ec200-ec400-ec800-series/  (but\
    \ I think they came from 3Com) when deploying computers in schools.<br /><br />Ahh,\
    \ the crazy days of an engineer\u2019s youth.  BR David Shephard"
