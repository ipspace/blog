      "html": "Hey Ivan, you missed the biggest &quot;gotcha&quot; in this process, which is licensing.  In most common cases, licenses are tied to serial numbers, which change every time you destroy/build a new VM.  You&#39;ll unfortunately need manual intervention to alleviate this (often even a phone call).<br />Some vendors are now allowing you have one universal license to tackle this particular issue, but it comes with its own &quot;cost&quot;.",

      "html": "And some vendors tie their right to use licenses to the MAC address of the physical host and when the IT group decides to go cloud, they spin up a VM and install the software and then have to spoof the MAC address in the vNIC. Otherwise they then have to fax a request to a reseller, wait a month to get the MAC address on the license changed. I call that Agile ;-)",
