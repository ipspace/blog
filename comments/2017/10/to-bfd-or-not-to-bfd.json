      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Is there any benefit when enabling BFD on OSPF as well on BGP?<br /><br />On a side note, I&#39;ve have seen cases where MPLS labels were misprogrammed into the FIB and this could have been detected with BFD. So I&#39;d like to make a case for LDP-OAM or RSVP-OAM, as those MPLS labels are separate from IGP routes in the FIB and those paths would need to be tested separately.<br /><br />I&#39;m not suggesting to have 50 ms timers everywhere, but just enabling BFD in more places can be a good step for a more robust network.<br /><br />Cheers",

What about OAM implementations like for ATM &amp; Ethernet?

      "html": "Bfd works for subs eco do convergence protocols such as link state and not bgp since bgp is nlri heavy protocol and convergence is almost around 10-15 seconds and it is not wise to use 3 seconds for hold timer in bgp as bgp boxes run heavy control plane traffic and the timers vary from peer to peer wrt number of routes.<br />Always use layer 1/2 detection subsecond for faster convergence.<br />Layer 3 detection can be for around 5-10sec. <br /><br />Bfd/bgp combination works fine. <br /><br /><br />",
