          "html": "I decided not to do updates on HPE switches this year. Looking from the outside, they can&#39;t decide whether to go with H3C or Altoline, and resell Arista in the meantime. Combine that with their ProCurve switches and they have four competing product lines. Which one do you want to bet on?",

      "html": "Well, let\u00b4s think about HPE:<br />- HP bought Compaq and dropped HP\u00b4s old servers. The current servers still have Compaq origins, I think?<br />- HP bought Colubris Wifi (MSM) series, then H3C, then Aruba. They dropped Colubris, then H3C wifi devices. Now we have Aruba, solely.<br />- HP once had &quot;Procurve&quot; switches, then bought H3C, then Aruba and now they have Arista and whitebox switches (Altoline). Procurve were renamed to Aruba but are still running ProcurveOS but include Aruba features. The new &quot;Aruba 8400&quot; has ArubaOS-CX. It\u00b4s modular and could replace the &quot;old&quot; 5400R ZL3 switches in some years.<br />- Arista switches are pushed very hard by HPE. Each time that HPE gold partner talks with me nowadays he mentions Arista. There are hardly new H3C based switches. Well 12902E and HPE 5980. But if you look at H3C homepages those were mentioned in 2015 for the first time.<br />- Arista datacenter switches are way more expensive than H3C based ones. So H3C has its position at HPE. But I think HPE will drop it one day in favor of Arista or what will be next bought by HPE.<br />",
