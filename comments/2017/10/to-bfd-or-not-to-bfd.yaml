    html: I would say BFD makes sense for any routing protocol in environments that
      have to detect router-to-router in sub-second time.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Is there any benefit when enabling BFD on OSPF as well
    on BGP?<br /><br />On a side note, I&#39;ve have seen cases where MPLS labels
    were misprogrammed into the FIB and this could have been detected with BFD. So
    I&#39;d like to make a case for LDP-OAM or RSVP-OAM, as those MPLS labels are
    separate from IGP routes in the FIB and those paths would need to be tested separately.<br
    /><br />I&#39;m not suggesting to have 50 ms timers everywhere, but just enabling
    BFD in more places can be a good step for a more robust network.<br /><br />Cheers

  html: '&gt;&gt;Furthermore, data link layer mechanisms cannot detect end-to-end
    failures across a layer-2 network.<br />Is this true in general? What about OAM
    implementations like for ATM &amp; Ethernet? I&#39;m not sure, but I believe ATM-OAM
    is end-to-end...<br />But besides the fact ATM is dead, you still can&#39;t be
    sure the PVC is ending to the right box...'

  html: Bfd works for subs eco do convergence protocols such as link state and not
    bgp since bgp is nlri heavy protocol and convergence is almost around 10-15 seconds
    and it is not wise to use 3 seconds for hold timer in bgp as bgp boxes run heavy
    control plane traffic and the timers vary from peer to peer wrt number of routes.<br
    />Always use layer 1/2 detection subsecond for faster convergence.<br />Layer
    3 detection can be for around 5-10sec. <br /><br />Bfd/bgp combination works fine.
