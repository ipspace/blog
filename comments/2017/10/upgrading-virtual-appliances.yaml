  html: Hey Ivan, you missed the biggest &quot;gotcha&quot; in this process, which
    is licensing.  In most common cases, licenses are tied to serial numbers, which
    change every time you destroy/build a new VM.  You&#39;ll unfortunately need manual
    intervention to alleviate this (often even a phone call).<br />Some vendors are
    now allowing you have one universal license to tackle this particular issue, but
    it comes with its own &quot;cost&quot;.

  html: And some vendors tie their right to use licenses to the MAC address of the
    physical host and when the IT group decides to go cloud, they spin up a VM and
    install the software and then have to spoof the MAC address in the vNIC. Otherwise
    they then have to fax a request to a reseller, wait a month to get the MAC address
    on the license changed. I call that Agile ;-)
