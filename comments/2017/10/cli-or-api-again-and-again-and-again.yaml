  html: '&gt;&gt;Wellfleet Technician Interface<br />Do you mean that Wellfleet SNMP-based
    GUI management stuff?<br />Looked nice, but gosh, that was slow as hell! But and
    it&#39;s still there, Nokia &amp; Siemens used it for its DSLAMs and afaik it
    still lives in the now-Adtran DSLAMs. Another one were the good old BayStacks,
    may they R.I.P. ;-)'

  html: 'There are 2 type of APIs. One that is more for humans. Using JSON or YAML.
    This is as slow as a CLI. Good for a few commands, quasi static configurations,
    but not for large scale SDN.<br /><br />And binary APIs that could be fast and
    scalable. These are not human readable. This is not the fashion now. Or we call
    them as protocols and not API. Such OF, PCEP, DLEP, FlowSpec, etc. <br /><br />For
    the former, the CLI is still better for humans than using RESTCONF. And trade
    unions might still insist on TL1... :-)<br /><br />For me the real question is
    more like this: what is your tasks? Just some static configuration or real-time
    control? If we call it CLI, API, whatever is secondary to me.<br />'
