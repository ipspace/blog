I used to work with IEEE 802.4 systems as part of Industrial Automation, for a company called MODICON  (later they merged with Schneider Automation) back in the day, with something called Modbus Plus. I have even been able to find a manual from 2004 hxxp://www.bh-automation.com/Download/Resources/ModBus-Plus-Planning-And-Installation-Guide.pdf and another one from 2012 hyyp://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Reference=1755869&amp;p_EnDocType=User%20guide&amp;p_File_Id=27613538&amp;p_File_Name=ATV71_Modbus_plus_EN_1755869_03.pdf . While there we also used a multi-drop coaxial based \u201cnetworking systems\u201d for remote I/O drops system based on a 1.544 Mbit/s Manchester encoded \u201cbackbone\u201d.<br /><br />In the early days with my first foray into Ethernet Networking in the 90\u2019s  I even remember multiport 10base2 Hubs like these  http://ethercom.com/products/hubs-repeaters/ec200-ec400-ec800-series/  (but I think they came from 3Com) when deploying computers in schools.<br /><br />Ahh, the crazy days of an engineer\u2019s youth.
