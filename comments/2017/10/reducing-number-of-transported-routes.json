          "html": "Thanks Sir Ivan,<br />how kind of you to answer so quickly!<br />I know you can do that too for sure.<br /><br />I met in person Luca Martini in Milan and I have seen one of the Kompella brothers&#39; in Alicante Juniper EMEA Professional services meeting in October 2010.<br /><br />To be honest MPLS gives me a job since 1999, so for me MPLS and advanced Multicast are keys to distinguish from the others. Of course I can not compare with you and I do not want to. But at least I&#39;m able to interact with you and this is something .<br /><br />I have saw a thread on CSC / MPLS about LFA and you have written clearly that is should be a NO NO in a good network design.<br /><br />Best Regards<br />Sincerly Yours<br /><br /><br /><br />Giuseppe Larosa<br /><br />",

      "html": "Hello mr Ivan Pepelnjiak,<br /><br />I would like you could make more clearer two sentences :<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally, I think MPLS is a red herring.<br /><br />what do you mean ?<br />I tried to look into www.wikipedia.org without finding a match.<br /><br />&gt;&gt; RFC 1925 states that there\u2019s nothing that cannot be solved with another layer of abstraction. In this case, we could use any one or more of a half-dozen overlay technologies (IPsec, GRE, VXLAN, DMVPN, LISP\u2026), or use an overlay technology sprinkled with unicorn dust (aka SD-WAN). The beauty of CE-to-CE tunnels is that they totally eliminate the need for PE-CE routing, and (when combined with VRFs) create independent routing domains, so you can use multiple SPs without the associated hassle.<br />Finally, you could go for a really exotic solution like Carriers-Carrier (using additional MPLS labels as the data-plane abstraction mechanism).<br /><br />Not so exotic and not so new if you prepared for CCIE SP in 2005 inventing your own labs<br /><br />I tested DMVPN over Carrier Supporting Carrier<br /><br />Many thanks for sharing your thoughts on so many subjects.<br /><br />Sincerly Yours<br />Giuseppe Larosa CCIE Service Provider # 14802, CCNA Voice, CCNP R&amp;S, JNCIA, ITIL SMFv3 <br />Cisco Support Community Hall of Fame member <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />",
