But and it&#39;s still there, Nokia &amp; Siemens used it for its DSLAMs and afaik it still lives in the now-Adtran DSLAMs. Another one were the good old BayStacks, may they R.I.P. ;-)",

      "html": "There are 2 type of APIs. One that is more for humans. Using JSON or YAML. This is as slow as a CLI. Good for a few commands, quasi static configurations, but not for large scale SDN.<br /><br />And binary APIs that could be fast and scalable. These are not human readable. This is not the fashion now. Or we call them as protocols and not API. Such OF, PCEP, DLEP, FlowSpec, etc. <br /><br />For the former, the CLI is still better for humans than using RESTCONF. And trade unions might still insist on TL1... :-)<br /><br />For me the real question is more like this: what is your tasks? Just some static configuration or real-time control? If we call it CLI, API, whatever is secondary to me.<br />",
