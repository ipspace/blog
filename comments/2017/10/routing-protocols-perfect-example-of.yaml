  html: 'Will you still use Bfd even if you have an Ip address directly configured
    on the interface without L2 transport in the middle to detect if there is some
    kind of software failure on the other side? I usually avoid it. '

  html: Yes, I do. Too many things can go wrong even on a simple point to point link.
    The latest ones I have observed are a router not properly detecting when a link
    goes down, and one of the SFPs on a DAC cable failing while keeping the link up
    towards the router. BFD detects all of these.
