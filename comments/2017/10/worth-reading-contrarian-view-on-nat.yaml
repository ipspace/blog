    html: This is a great response.  <br />If IPV6 goes truly beyond the poor countries,
      the content providers and the cell phones networks - it is time to hang up my
      boots and open a bar beside the sea.

  html: 'Yeah, because people with operational experience know how to fix all problems.
    And they know what is best for the future. Sure.<br /><br />If it was up to the
    operational people, the Internet would have been one huge flat layer-2 domain.
    Because that is easiest to operate. If it doesn&#39;t work, blame the vendors.<br
    /><br />Somebody has to make this technology work.<br />What we needed in IPng
    was: variable-length addresses, locator/identifier separation, any device is allowed
    to re-write the network part of an address. But 25 years ago, the IPv6 community
    was opposed to that. They wanted the same thing as IPv4, only with 96 more bits.
    The reason was that everyone with a clue was working to become a millionaire by
    making the IPv4 Internet work. And all the clueless people who played no role
    whatsoever in the IPv4 world took hold of IPng. IPv6 is the work of talentless
    amateurs.<br /><br />Somebody has to make this technology work.<br />And over
    the last 25 years it was CIDR and NAT that made the Internet work. Not IPv6. If
    it had been up to IPv6 to save the world, we&#39;d now all be paying for our Internet
    services by the minute. On a 128 Kbps connection over ATM.'

  html: 'Interesting<br />But failed to mention a few problems. <br />With no more
    IPv4 addresses left it is harder to dual home to the internet, you don&#39;t own
    your IP addresses so when connecting to dual ISPs you can&#39;t publish a single
    space through both ISPs which force to use some kind of GSLB which is not that
    good. <br /><br />Furthermore it failed to mention that a single host can use
    more than one connection, so you don&#39;t really borrow all the bits from the
    Tcp udp layer. <br /><br />True IPv6 is hard to adopt,and it is a real problem
    that it not backwards compatible. <br />But I don&#39;t see any other solution
    in the future, we can&#39;t keep doing workarounds forever and eventually we will
    have to solve the problem from the roots '

  html: "Interesting perspective, to say the least. I do love that you posted it \u2014\
    \ \uFFFDI couldn\u2019t agree more that well-argued contrarian positions are worthwhile\
    \ to read.<br /><br />I do think that the piece falls short of its goal of providing\
    \ a defense that NATs are anything better than a necessary evil. The &quot;NATs\
    \ as Architecture&quot; section talks about how &quot;the IPv4 architecture made\
    \ several simplifying assumptions&quot;, and to paraphrase, they are 1) that addresses\
    \ are 1:1 with hosts and 2) that mobility wasn\u2019t accounted for. It also suggests\
    \ that NATs helped applications break free from these limitations. <br /><br />I\
    \ can\u2019t find a strong footing for either of these. For instance, RFC 1123\
    \ talks about how DNS might return multiple addresses for a host and that the\
    \ \u201Capplication protocol implementations SHOULD be prepared to try multiple\
    \ addresses from the list [of addresses] until success is obtained.&quot; This\
    \ doesn\u2019t sound like addresses being 1:1. Whether applications actually implemented\
    \ this behavior is another story \u2014 most didn\u2019t. \uFFFDThat points the\
    \ finger at applications and socket libraries rather than at any sort of architectural\
    \ property of IPv4.<br /><br />For the second bit, assume for a second that NAT\
    \ did free the internet from its &quot;IP &lt;-&gt; host identity&quot; relationship.\
    \ Why then is NAT so important in mobility like Geoff argues? Permanent addressing\
    \ doesn\u2019t mean &quot;permanent endpoint association&quot;. If applications\
    \ (or TCP) really did keep sessions intact disjoint from their &quot;IP, port\
    \ &lt;-&gt; identity&quot; tuples, then shouldn\u2019t mobility be a piece of\
    \ cake for IPv4 and IPv6? Simply change addresses as you move between cell towers,\
    \ the application knows how to keep a socket together! It seems like NAT is instead\
    \ the tourniquet that stops applications from bleeding out when they change locations.<br\
    \ /><br />NAT can\u2019t have been both the cure and the salve for the side effects.<br\
    \ /><br />It\u2019s a pretty good retrospective of what happened, though. :)"

  html: I think that Geoff Huston has made an important point. NAT has put pressure
    on applications to be independent of underlying IP addresses. Device mobility
    and temporary addresses have done the same. Identifying a network connection by
    the tuple local-IP-address:local-port:remote-IP-address:remote-port:protocol no
    longer makes sense, and work-arounds like Mobile IP add complexity in order to
    preserve such a simplistic model. Hosts need end-to-end reachability (but not
    necessarily end-to-end addressing), and applications need good layering to be
    able to sustain connections through any address change or translation.<br />
