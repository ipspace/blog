  html: Can&#39;t agree more Ivan. Automating the network configuration with yang
    based modelling tools but doing the same config change during an off-peak &amp;
    15-day notice window (even with the right intention) does still make time to market
    &gt; 15 days+. Hope the hype with lots of automation stuff will soon reach the
    enlightenment curve ;)

  html: 'In our shop, deploying a vm takes an hour or two including all the technical
    teams (server, storage, security, backup, AD, monitoring, ...). Prior setup by
    the architects (IP adresses, vlans , firewall rules, ...) takes one or two days.
    The administrative and budgetary processes haggling can take up to a month.<br
    /><br />We use templates and powershell not for speed but for uniformity. '

  html: 'At network service providers the biggest problem is the business side development
    of a product. Pricing schemes, charging, BSS processes, training of CRM agents,
    etc. The technology part is usually the smallest problem. <br />In most European
    telcos in smaller countries, they do not have so much customers that the daily
    transactions could not be made with simple semi-automated methods. <br />The SDN
    story has not improved significantly the business case, since 80-85% of the product
    cost is on the business side. Going with SDN is a fashion and a pressure from
    the vendors. They just stop supporting some technologies, the volume drops, the
    prices go high. <br />For example, there is nothing wrong with classical TDM/PDH/SDH.
    Juts it is getting out of fashion, so it becomes less available in all terms and
    more expensive. Although the technology cost is small, but it shall not increase
    for established products. So sooner or later you are enforced by the vendors to
    reinvent the wheel. But it is bad for the business, so telcos try to postpone
    such changes as much as possible. Selling classical phone services or leased-lines
    is the best business from the financial point of view. It has such a high profit
    rate, that nothing else can even come close to it...<br />There is one exception
    to the fashion driven changes, when an old technology does not scale up. Like
    the SAR function in ATM. No one was interested to make a higher speed version,
    so you were forced to change to some other technologies. <br />Of course, the
    vendor pressure of fashion comes from their financial need of continous cash-flow.
    They have to enforce their customers for buying something new. Sooner or later
    the telcos will revolt and take back some of technology into their own hands.
    See ONOS/CORD or ONAP... <br /> '
