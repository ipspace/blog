      "html": "Thanks so much for shedding light on this, Ivan.  So many people are of the opinion that huge buffers make things &quot;better&quot;, when this is very often not the case (&amp; tuning them to achieve good results is incredibly complex).<br /><br />I&#39;ve been reading a lot about the CAKE queue discipline, part of the bufferbloat project: https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki/CakeTechnical/<br />The authors have an incredibly good practical understanding of what makes networks stay fast under load.<br /><br />I would love to see this qdisc implemented on platforms like Mellanox Spectrum, that have enough buffer to do it right at 100GE &amp; still remain cost-effective.",

      "html": "Great blog, amazing insights. Finally, got the idea of selective ACKs into my thick skull. In fact I didn&#39;t even know about SACKs until earlier this month. Now I know about them and how they work, totally grateful. TCP sure is a wack-a-mole beast and many of the ideas I had about it are now out of date. What is really scary is what Juhu has seen in the field, people actually, without knowing the repercussion, removing SACKs. That&#39;s like removing the brake from a car or the instrument panel.",
