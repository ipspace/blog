            <div class="comment-content">Having only one LSA5 left is indeed listed in RFC:<br />
https: //www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2328.html#page-142<br />

<p>&quot;The following rule is thereby established: if two routers, both reachable from one another, originate functionally equivalent AS-external-LSAs (i.e., same destination, cost and non-zero forwarding address), then the LSA originated by the router having the highest OSPF Router ID is used.  The router having the lower OSPF Router ID can then flush its LSA.&quot;</p>

<p>It also mandates to use ASBR with highest RID.</p>
