            <div class="comment-content">I would argue that &quot;too many features&quot; is a good reason for &quot;good old fashioned ignorance&quot; -- if there are so many features that you can&#39;t even hope to know about them, and more are added every month/week/day, it&#39;s going to be difficult to see how anyone can be anything except ignorant about all of them.... :-)<br /><br />Russ</div>

            <div class="comment-content">And of course I cannot help but agree with you, but my point was that people working on feature X obviously don&#39;t ask the questions &quot;what&#39;s the attack surface of feature X?&quot; and &quot;how do we protect feature X?&quot; (i.e. security is not an integral part of feature development).</div>
