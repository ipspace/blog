      "html": "This is quite similar to the usual error detection and correction mechanisms we use like CRC. With no parity bits you can&#39;t assert anything (single chrono). With 1 bit you can detect 1 error but not correct (two chronos, second is the &quot;parity&quot;). With 2 bits of parity you can detect and correct 1 error (three chronos where 2 agree and 1 doesn&#39;t).<br /><br />As for two-node cluster, you are golden if the node can detect its own failure and remove himself from the cluster or if the second node can detect the first failed and take over the cluster by itself.<br /><br />I understand Marko&#39;s comment but from a practical purposes I would still rather have a 2-node cluster and prepare to respond to the problems that might eventually emerge from it than have a single node. I wouldn&#39;t put &quot;hot spare&quot; as a solution to single node, this is a 2-node in primary/standby and the same caveats apply (detect errors for switch over, could incorrectly become master with split brain, etc.).",

      "html": "Hey Ivan,<br /><br />Regarding the comments about stackables. Trying to understand your thinking here as I don&#39;t see this as really the same thing. In the case of the chronometers, this is a multi-master model where both are processing data ( time ) at the same time and capable of spitting out different outputs.  More like a Cisco Nexus VPC MLAG or Arista MLAG scenario.  In the case of Cisco VSS, Juniper Virtual Chassis, or HPE IRF, there&#39;s one master in the group that has full control and all the other units are simply subscribed ( more or less ) to the master&#39;s view of the world.  The failover will happen regardless of whether there&#39;s 2 or more because the next box in priority is going to become the master and life goes on.   <br /><br />not to say there aren&#39;t other issues with borg scenarios, as I know you&#39;re well aware, but I just don&#39;t know if this particular comparison is fair.  <br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br />@netmanchris",

The Mythical Man-Month, Anniversary Edition: Essays On Software Engineering (Kindle Locations 754-758). Pearson Education. Kindle Edition.<br />Especially chapter 5 the Second System Effect -  all Network architects and engineers should consider a read. <br />The essay on Interactive Discipline for the Architect is still very applicable in today&#39;s fast paced design to implementation and environment and  when dealing with a Vendor(s) who is acting as the Architect or Implementer.<br />The essay on Self-Discipline - The second -System Effect<br />Especially about the concept of Stretch. <br />\u201cConsider as a stronger case the architecture, implementation, and even the realization of the Stretch computer, an outlet for the pent-up inventive desires of many people, and a second system for most of them. As Strachey says in a review: I get the impression that Stretch is in some way the end of one line of development. Like some early computer programs it is immensely ingenious, immensely complicated, and extremely effective, but somehow at the same time crude, wasteful, and inelegant, and one feels that there must be a better way of doing things.\u201d<br /><br />--------------<br /><br />\u201cHow does the architect avoid the second-system effect? Well, obviously he can&#39;t skip his second system. But he can be conscious of the peculiar hazards of that system, and exert extra self-discipline to avoid functional ornamentation and to avoid extrapolation of functions that are obviated by changes in assumptions and purposes.\u201d<br />And comparing the concept of stretch from Mythical Man Month above to the definition/concept of Stretch in Network Architectures from White, Russ; Donohue, Denise. The Art of Network Architecture: Business-Driven Design (Networking Technology) (p. 81). Pearson Education. Kindle Edition.<br />\u201cModularization and Optimization If modularization brings so many benefits to network architecture, why shouldn\u2019t every network be modularized at every point possible?

      "html": "<br /><br />-----------------------<br />One of the trade-offs we deal with all the time is state versus stretch. Stretch, quite simply, is the difference between the optimum path through the network (for any pair of hosts) and the actual path through the network. For instance, if the shortest actual path available is 2 hops, but traffic is flowing along a 3 hop path, the stretch is 1. Why should we ever have stretch in a network? It seems like you\u2019d just never, ever, want stretch, because stretch always represents suboptimal use of available resources. But you always end up with stretch, because one of the other fundamental concepts of network design is the use of information hiding to break up failure domains. Hierarchical network design, in fact, is the intentional use of aggregation to reduce the state information\u2014 the routing table size, in most cases\u2014 in the control plane, so that changes in one area of the network don\u2019t cause changes in the routing table halfway around the world. How does this relate to stretch? Anytime you hide state you increase stretch. This might not be obvious in all networks\u2014 specifically, anytime 100% of your traffic flows north/ south, decreasing state will not impact stretch. <br />--------------------<br />But if you have a combination of north/ south and east/ west traffic, then aggregation\u2014 reducing state\u2014 will always cause traffic to take a suboptimal path through the network\u2014 thus increasing stretch. Spanning tree is a perfect example of running to one extreme of the state/ stretch trade-off. Spanning tree reduces the state by forcing all traffic along a single tree in the network and blocking links that don\u2019t belong to that tree. Control plane state is absolutely minimized at the cost of increasing the stretch through the network to the maximum possible\u2014 to the point that we often design network topologies around the elimination of links not used on the single tree.\u201d<br />",
