    html: And of course I cannot help but agree with you, but my point was that people
      working on feature X obviously don&#39;t ask the questions &quot;what&#39;s
      the attack surface of feature X?&quot; and &quot;how do we protect feature X?&quot;
      (i.e. security is not an integral part of feature development).

  html: I would argue that &quot;too many features&quot; is a good reason for &quot;good
    old fashioned ignorance&quot; -- if there are so many features that you can&#39;t
    even hope to know about them, and more are added every month/week/day, it&#39;s
    going to be difficult to see how anyone can be anything except ignorant about
    all of them.... :-)<br /><br />Russ
