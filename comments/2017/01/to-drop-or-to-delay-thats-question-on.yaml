  html: 'Thanks so much for shedding light on this, Ivan.  So many people are of the
    opinion that huge buffers make things &quot;better&quot;, when this is very often
    not the case (&amp; tuning them to achieve good results is incredibly complex).<br
    /><br />I&#39;ve been reading a lot about the CAKE queue discipline, part of the
    bufferbloat project: https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki/CakeTechnical/<br
    />The authors have an incredibly good practical understanding of what makes networks
    stay fast under load.<br /><br />I would love to see this qdisc implemented on
    platforms like Mellanox Spectrum, that have enough buffer to do it right at 100GE
    &amp; still remain cost-effective.'

  html: Great blog, amazing insights. Finally, got the idea of selective ACKs into
    my thick skull. In fact I didn&#39;t even know about SACKs until earlier this
    month. Now I know about them and how they work, totally grateful. TCP sure is
    a wack-a-mole beast and many of the ideas I had about it are now out of date.
    What is really scary is what Juhu has seen in the field, people actually, without
    knowing the repercussion, removing SACKs. That&#39;s like removing the brake from
    a car or the instrument panel.

  html: Loss probes seem relevant and I don&#39;t believe they were mentioned in the
    discussion. I believe they were added in Linux v3. https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dukkipati-tcpm-tcp-loss-probe-01#section-2
