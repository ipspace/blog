    html: 'I&#39;ve sent an email.<br />Oh btw, talking about &#39;modern&#39; scalable
      data center architecture &amp; VXLAN EVPN: the latter doesn&#39;t support an
      IPv6 underlay. That is, I know Cisco and Cumulus don&#39;t support it. For one,
      no uniform configuration template by (ab)using link local addresses :(<br />'

    html: Got it, thank you... I&#39;m in panic-the-course-is-starting-today mode,
      will get back to you sometime next week.<br /><br />As for &quot;uniform configuration&quot;
      - you can do it on Cumulus because they can exchange IPv4 routes over IPv6 BGP
      session (which runs over LLA). Details somewhere in my blog posts and free videos
      (and I think I did a podcast with Dinesh once).

  html: 'OpenStack and neutron networking is... interesting :) Worked on/with that
    for a couple of private cloud implementations last couple of years. And to top
    it off: I&#39;m currently investigating neutron connectivity to our VXLAN EVPN
    physical network (leaf-spine fabric of course to tick all the right boxes :) <br
    />If you like to exchange ideas, I&#39;d be interested to hear in what directions
    you&#39;ve been thinking.<br />'
