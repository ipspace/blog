  html: Even if I get your point, I would say that two is better than one. The mean
    value gets better with the number of components, and you would have half the error
    of a wrong chrono.

    html: I was not thinking about hot spare but active active. And IMHO, the cluster
      control problem and the metering problem do not seem to be the same.<br />Do
      you disagree with the only statement I made ? That the error of a measure would
      be halved ?

  html: I disagree. With one component, the failure modes and mitigation (hot spare).
    With two, the problem space is greater, and split. Rain issues are difficult to
    diagnose and mitigate (re-read Ivan&#39;s text).

    html: 'It&#39;s definitely better to have a spare than no spare, but the real
      problem is somewhere else: there&#39;s absolutely no reliable way of doing automatic
      failover in a 2-node cluster regardless of what the vendors are telling you.'

  html: This is quite similar to the usual error detection and correction mechanisms
    we use like CRC. With no parity bits you can&#39;t assert anything (single chrono).
    With 1 bit you can detect 1 error but not correct (two chronos, second is the
    &quot;parity&quot;). With 2 bits of parity you can detect and correct 1 error
    (three chronos where 2 agree and 1 doesn&#39;t).<br /><br />As for two-node cluster,
    you are golden if the node can detect its own failure and remove himself from
    the cluster or if the second node can detect the first failed and take over the
    cluster by itself.<br /><br />I understand Marko&#39;s comment but from a practical
    purposes I would still rather have a 2-node cluster and prepare to respond to
    the problems that might eventually emerge from it than have a single node. I wouldn&#39;t
    put &quot;hot spare&quot; as a solution to single node, this is a 2-node in primary/standby
    and the same caveats apply (detect errors for switch over, could incorrectly become
    master with split brain, etc.).

    html: The problems seem different, but are pretty similar - in both cases the
      challenge is &quot;what is the majority if we get divergence&quot;, in our case
      &quot;what should each part of the cluster do if we get partition?&quot;<br
      /><br />While an even number of cluster members is always a challenge, it might
      not be as bad if you have 4 or 6. You might be able to fake it by giving the
      master another half vote ;) Have to think a bit more about it... or someone
      could send me a link to the result (which would be highly appreciated).

  html: Hey Ivan,<br /><br />Regarding the comments about stackables. Trying to understand
    your thinking here as I don&#39;t see this as really the same thing. In the case
    of the chronometers, this is a multi-master model where both are processing data
    ( time ) at the same time and capable of spitting out different outputs.  More
    like a Cisco Nexus VPC MLAG or Arista MLAG scenario.  In the case of Cisco VSS,
    Juniper Virtual Chassis, or HPE IRF, there&#39;s one master in the group that
    has full control and all the other units are simply subscribed ( more or less
    ) to the master&#39;s view of the world.  The failover will happen regardless
    of whether there&#39;s 2 or more because the next box in priority is going to
    become the master and life goes on.   <br /><br />not to say there aren&#39;t
    other issues with borg scenarios, as I know you&#39;re well aware, but I just
    don&#39;t know if this particular comparison is fair.  <br /><br />Thoughts?<br

    html: And they both advertise the same subnet to the core, and when the packet
      arrives to one of the switches it cannot get to the host because that path is
      down due to LACP system ID mismatch. <br /><br />The only sane way to handle
      MLAG cluster (or switch stack) splits is to shut down half of it, but the of
      course you don&#39;t know which part to shut down. QED.

  html: In the case of MLAG, the lacp peers act as witnesses. If both switches in
    a MLAG think they&#39;re the master at the same time, they report a different
    lacp id. The other end won&#39;t bond a link with different ID&#39;s and becomes
    the &quot;tiebreaker&quot;.<br /><br />Of course every vendor&#39;s MLAG implementation
    is a little different &amp; I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if at least one of them
    messed up an important detail of the split brain scenario in a subtle but unfortunate
    way.

    \ in a review: I get the impression that Stretch is in some way the end of one\
    \ line of development. Like some early computer programs it is immensely ingenious,\
    \ immensely complicated, and extremely effective, but somehow at the same time\
    \ crude, wasteful, and inelegant, and one feels that there must be a better way\

    \ extrapolation of functions that are obviated by changes in assumptions and purposes.\u201D\
    <br />And comparing the concept of stretch from Mythical Man Month above to the\
    \ definition/concept of Stretch in Network Architectures from White, Russ; Donohue,\

  html: "<br /><br />-----------------------<br />One of the trade-offs we deal with\
    \ all the time is state versus stretch. Stretch, quite simply, is the difference\
    \ between the optimum path through the network (for any pair of hosts) and the\
    \ actual path through the network. For instance, if the shortest actual path available\
    \ is 2 hops, but traffic is flowing along a 3 hop path, the stretch is 1. Why\
    \ should we ever have stretch in a network? It seems like you\u2019d just never,\
    \ ever, want stretch, because stretch always represents suboptimal use of available\
    \ resources. But you always end up with stretch, because one of the other fundamental\
    \ concepts of network design is the use of information hiding to break up failure\
    \ domains. Hierarchical network design, in fact, is the intentional use of aggregation\
    \ to reduce the state information\u2014 the routing table size, in most cases\u2014\
    \ in the control plane, so that changes in one area of the network don\u2019t\
    \ cause changes in the routing table halfway around the world. How does this relate\
    \ to stretch? Anytime you hide state you increase stretch. This might not be obvious\
    \ in all networks\u2014 specifically, anytime 100% of your traffic flows north/\
    \ south, decreasing state will not impact stretch. <br />--------------------<br\
    \ />But if you have a combination of north/ south and east/ west traffic, then\
    \ aggregation\u2014 reducing state\u2014 will always cause traffic to take a suboptimal\
    \ path through the network\u2014 thus increasing stretch. Spanning tree is a perfect\
    \ example of running to one extreme of the state/ stretch trade-off. Spanning\
    \ tree reduces the state by forcing all traffic along a single tree in the network\
    \ and blocking links that don\u2019t belong to that tree. Control plane state\
    \ is absolutely minimized at the cost of increasing the stretch through the network\
    \ to the maximum possible\u2014 to the point that we often design network topologies\
    \ around the elimination of links not used on the single tree.\u201D<br />"
