That is, I know Cisco and Cumulus don&#39;t support it. For one, no uniform configuration template by (ab)using link local addresses :(<br />",

I&#39;m in panic-the-course-is-starting-today mode, will get back to you sometime next week.<br /><br />As for &quot;uniform configuration&quot; - you can do it on Cumulus because they can exchange IPv4 routes over IPv6 BGP session (which runs over LLA). Details somewhere in my blog posts and free videos (and I think I did a podcast with Dinesh once).",

And to top it off: I&#39;m currently investigating neutron connectivity to our VXLAN EVPN physical network (leaf-spine fabric of course to tick all the right boxes :) <br />If you like to exchange ideas, I&#39;d be interested to hear in what directions you&#39;ve been thinking.<br />",
