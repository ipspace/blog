This is why when you set connected interfaces to redistribute it inserts them as type 5 or type 7. You cannot put them in the LSA database as anything but external which kind of sucks.",

If I am not mistaken, vmware NSX uses this on its logical routers, where the OSPF sessions are maintained by another VM.<br /><br />Other than that, I only came across this behavior when something went wrong on a network,.",

      "html": "Rather than make the interfaces passive you could maybe change the network type to something that doesn&#39;t dynamically discover neighbors. Prevents accidental adjacency and still lets you have ospf active on the interface. Maybe some consider that even kludgier, but I don&#39;t really consider this scenario that bad. I don&#39;t really mind any of the scenarios in this post, to be honest. <br /><br />As far as the academics, smart people of course, but sometimes their proposals are way of base. Seems like a lot of the stuff is either not fully functional, or end up looking like OSPF or BGP by another name. I took Nick Feamster&#39;s course once, and while interesting, most of the routing replacements he proposed were basically as bad or equal to kludgy static routing. Some parts of the course were cool but those were the parts that had nothing to do with the forwarding plane. ",
