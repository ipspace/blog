  html: I think config management is just the simple low hanging fruit. My first adventure
    jumping in was automating the troubleshooting process of common problems Sr level
    guys/gals were drug into. Its not perfect but its a start and helps.

  html: So there is a network with one hundred of switch stacks and the admin, who
    is responsible for the network does not know the uptime values of these switches
    and he has to create a script to gather such basic info? If I was his customer,
    I would thank him for the report and end the contract immediately :)

  html: Keep in mind that automation for a network like google&#39;s was built out
    of need.  You begin to understand what can make you more efficient out of those
    needs.  They may have started by doing things like creating replicable models
    and scripts to build efficiently.  That led to their design modularity and towards
    network automation (vs device automation).  One good outage and they began to
    want to fix things faster leading to research into resiliency and automated recovery.
    That grew from there to SDN and centralized control for optimization and further
    resiliency. The mindset of automation and optimization is where networking professionals
    need to be going to.<br />A company implementing 100 switch stacks, without understanding
    how to do this without reason and efficient cost modeling would soon find themselves
    out of business.  I guarantee that anyone with a large enough burden to necessitate
    100 switch stacks would have figured that out rather than go out of business.
