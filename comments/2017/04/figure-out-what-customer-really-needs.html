            <div class="comment-content">&quot;The correct approach is to figure out what problem they’re trying to solve, work with them to understand the limitations (from application architecture, database setup, storage replication…) and finally propose a solution that’s close enough to what they think they need but doesn’t compromise the network stability.&quot;<br /><br />I think you are confusing the role of &quot;Enterprise Architect&quot; and &quot;Network Engineer&quot; a bit here. If the Network Engineer needs to figure these requirements out, the Enterprise Architect is not doing his job. <br /><br />I agree that many EA&#39;s don&#39;t know the first thing about networking principles, but if you want to solve this problem fundamentally, you educate your EA, instead of re-engineering the requirements of every IT application.<br /><br />Automation does not stop at OSI layer 7 ;)<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">While I agree with you, in practice there&#39;s a huge gap between theory and practice, ranging from &quot;what&#39;s an Enterprise Architect&quot; to &quot;Enterprise Architect doesn&#39;t need to know the dirty details&quot; ;)<br /><br />Also, since my blog is way below the radar of Enterprise Architects, the best I can do is to educate the people who have to deal with the consequences.<br /><br />Anyway, IT is not the only discipline where architects live in rainbow-colored clouds. I had the dubious &quot;privilege&quot; of being involved in a few building projects...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Well, whether it&#39;s a building or a network, as far as so called &quot;architects&quot; are concerned, it&#39;s the same:<br />Don&#39;t approach any project without having a structural engineer involved - the only difference is, that in IT this job is called &quot;network engineer&quot;...<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">I think that&#39;s not an education problem, it&#39;s impossible to have the knowledge of a senior network engineer without years of hands on experience (I recall Ivan had a good post about this but couldn&#39;t find it).<br />IMHO a good architect should create the plan and peer review it with the stakeholders, network and systems engineers, ...  &quot;there&#39;s a huge gap between theory and practice&quot; that you can overcome with this practice. <br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">In my opinion an Enterprise Architect is a translator. Someone who can take the high level business requirements from the business and gather the correct technical groups and present them with the requirements in semi-technical terms. In my experience they devote the majority of their time dealing with the business than with the technical teams.</div>
