      "html": "&quot;The correct approach is to figure out what problem they\u2019re trying to solve, work with them to understand the limitations (from application architecture, database setup, storage replication\u2026) and finally propose a solution that\u2019s close enough to what they think they need but doesn\u2019t compromise the network stability.&quot;<br /><br />I think you are confusing the role of &quot;Enterprise Architect&quot; and &quot;Network Engineer&quot; a bit here. If the Network Engineer needs to figure these requirements out, the Enterprise Architect is not doing his job. <br /><br />I agree that many EA&#39;s don&#39;t know the first thing about networking principles, but if you want to solve this problem fundamentally, you educate your EA, instead of re-engineering the requirements of every IT application.<br /><br />Automation does not stop at OSI layer 7 ;)<br />",

Someone who can take the high level business requirements from the business and gather the correct technical groups and present them with the requirements in semi-technical terms.
