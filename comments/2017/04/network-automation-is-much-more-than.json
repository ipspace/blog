If I was his customer, I would thank him for the report and end the contract immediately :)",

      "html": "Keep in mind that automation for a network like google&#39;s was built out of need.  You begin to understand what can make you more efficient out of those needs.  They may have started by doing things like creating replicable models and scripts to build efficiently.  That led to their design modularity and towards network automation (vs device automation).  One good outage and they began to want to fix things faster leading to research into resiliency and automated recovery. That grew from there to SDN and centralized control for optimization and further resiliency. The mindset of automation and optimization is where networking professionals need to be going to.<br />A company implementing 100 switch stacks, without understanding how to do this without reason and efficient cost modeling would soon find themselves out of business.  I guarantee that anyone with a large enough burden to necessitate 100 switch stacks would have figured that out rather than go out of business.",
