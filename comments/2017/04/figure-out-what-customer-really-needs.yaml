    html: While I agree with you, in practice there&#39;s a huge gap between theory
      and practice, ranging from &quot;what&#39;s an Enterprise Architect&quot; to
      &quot;Enterprise Architect doesn&#39;t need to know the dirty details&quot;
      ;)<br /><br />Also, since my blog is way below the radar of Enterprise Architects,
      the best I can do is to educate the people who have to deal with the consequences.<br
      /><br />Anyway, IT is not the only discipline where architects live in rainbow-colored
      clouds. I had the dubious &quot;privilege&quot; of being involved in a few building
      projects...

    html: Well, whether it&#39;s a building or a network, as far as so called &quot;architects&quot;
      are concerned, it&#39;s the same:<br />Don&#39;t approach any project without
      having a structural engineer involved - the only difference is, that in IT this
      job is called &quot;network engineer&quot;...<br />

    html: I think that&#39;s not an education problem, it&#39;s impossible to have
      the knowledge of a senior network engineer without years of hands on experience
      (I recall Ivan had a good post about this but couldn&#39;t find it).<br />IMHO
      a good architect should create the plan and peer review it with the stakeholders,
      network and systems engineers, ...  &quot;there&#39;s a huge gap between theory
      and practice&quot; that you can overcome with this practice. <br />

  html: "&quot;The correct approach is to figure out what problem they\u2019re trying\
    \ to solve, work with them to understand the limitations (from application architecture,\
    \ database setup, storage replication\u2026) and finally propose a solution that\u2019\
    s close enough to what they think they need but doesn\u2019t compromise the network\
    \ stability.&quot;<br /><br />I think you are confusing the role of &quot;Enterprise\
    \ Architect&quot; and &quot;Network Engineer&quot; a bit here. If the Network\
    \ Engineer needs to figure these requirements out, the Enterprise Architect is\
    \ not doing his job. <br /><br />I agree that many EA&#39;s don&#39;t know the\
    \ first thing about networking principles, but if you want to solve this problem\
    \ fundamentally, you educate your EA, instead of re-engineering the requirements\
    \ of every IT application.<br /><br />Automation does not stop at OSI layer 7\
    \ ;)<br />"

  html: In my opinion an Enterprise Architect is a translator. Someone who can take
    the high level business requirements from the business and gather the correct
    technical groups and present them with the requirements in semi-technical terms.
    In my experience they devote the majority of their time dealing with the business
    than with the technical teams.
