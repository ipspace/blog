    html: That sounds easy! Just missing one (big) part... automation. I can go out
      there and buy a car piece by piece it&#39;s just going to cost me x10 and I
      still have to put it together.

  html: "Why shouldn\xB4t we simply use private vlans with VMware\xB4s distributed\
    \ vSwitch and the corresponding top of rack switch? Add a firewall and you have\
    \ &quot;micro segmentation&quot;. DCI can be done with simple VXLAN on your TOR\
    \ switch aswell.<br /><br />I really cannot see a reason for using VMware\xB4\
    s NSX. So why should I use it?"

    html: Apart from that, there&#39;s the problem of &quot;how much traffic goes
      through that firewall and where do you put it&quot;

  html: Seems like there is a large variance in what people consider &quot;micro-segmentation&quot;
    and maybe there should be a category like &quot;meso-segmentation&quot;.
