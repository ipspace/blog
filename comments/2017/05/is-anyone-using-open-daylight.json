          "html": "Yes, intent models are the way to go. Applications shouldn&#39;t have to bother with &quot;programming the network&quot;. Specify what you need, and let the orchestrator figure it out. However, if you&#39;re going to use intent models, use TOSCA, not YANG. YANG is just a data modeling language, whereas TOSCA is an orchestration language (which includes a full data modeling component). ",

          "html": "Thanks for your reply Chris. We obviously agree on the intent-part. The problem with TOSCA is that it can only describe cloud applications stacks. If you want to convey intent to anything that is not a cloud (i.e. a network element, a packet core, an optical network), TOSCA can&#39;t help you. <br /><br />So it depends where you come from and what the abstraction level is where you want to play. If you can manage with the models standardised by OASIS, then TOSCA is the way to go. But if you need to adapt and extend the models themselves to fit your business, YANG might be a better fit.",

      "html": "&quot;For our startup, we subsequently moved away from ODL (or for that matter, any controller based apps), to realizing SDN-like orchestration systems for legacy networks, using model-driven mediation platform, which is finding good traction.&quot;<br /><br />Its not only startups moving away from ODL to model-driven mediation platforms. Its large companies as well... <br /><br />OpenFlow and ODL were interesting technology for the lab, but it didn&#39;t solve any real world problem (Ok, we could rip the CPU from the forwarding system, but thats not really the cost). Conveying the intent to and from a platform through an abstracted interface (hello, YANG!) does make sense. It gives you flexibility with regard to the platforms you deploy (reducing vendor lock-in) and enables you to open your service platform in a controlled manner to the rest of the organisation through APIs (increasing service velocity).

Yay! What could possibly go wrong? And let&#39;s have microflows (e.g., matching l2 src and dst pairs) everywhere, it sounds like a great idea!
