If you decide to go for NAT44, you need some sort of deterministic CGNAT in order to be compliant. Sadly (and stupidly?), from that standpoint, v6 is not a solution.",

      "html": "I disagree with this &quot;IPv4-to-IPv4 CG-NAT is the hack-of-last-resort for people who believe they cannot roll out IPv6 for whatever reason&quot;<br /><br />Rolling out IPv6 doesn&#39;t solve the lack of IPv4 problem if you&#39;re a residential ISP - you still have to use some form of NAT to provide access to IPv4 resources for your customers. CG-NAT doesn&#39;t require anything on the CPE side, so it works for most situations where you don&#39;t control the endpoints or CPEs.<br /><br />I&#39;m not convinced that the other mechanisms (like 6rd, DS-Lite, 464xlat) are much better than CG-NAT, nor do they solve the same set of problems<br /><br />Of course, you want to have IPv6 alongside CG-NAT, so clients can use native IPv6 where possible. This reduces load on your CG-NAT infrastructure, which helps the business case for making IPv6 available to customers.<br /><br />Just to be clear, I am a believer in moving to IPv6 wherever possible. I would never argue in favour of CG-NAT *instead* of IPv6. Instead I think it&#39;s a complementary approach, that helps those ISPs that don&#39;t have massive legacy IPv4 allocations.",
