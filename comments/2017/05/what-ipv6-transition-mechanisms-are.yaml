    html: And of course you&#39;re right. Added a remark. And yes, DS-Lite is the
      same as CG-NAT. MAP is better.

    html: Thanks. I probably should do some reading on MAP-T too, I&#39;m not so familiar
      with that one.

    html: 'Also, don&#39;t forget about law enforcement regulations: in several regions,
      ISPs are mandated to be able to uniquely identify a customer (usually, given
      a public IP, timestamp and - possibly but unlikely - source port). <br /><br
      />That complicates dual stack rollout as you can&#39;t just NAT all your v4
      eyeballs together. If you decide to go for NAT44, you need some sort of deterministic
      CGNAT in order to be compliant. Sadly (and stupidly?), from that standpoint,
      v6 is not a solution.'

  html: I disagree with this &quot;IPv4-to-IPv4 CG-NAT is the hack-of-last-resort
    for people who believe they cannot roll out IPv6 for whatever reason&quot;<br
    /><br />Rolling out IPv6 doesn&#39;t solve the lack of IPv4 problem if you&#39;re
    a residential ISP - you still have to use some form of NAT to provide access to
    IPv4 resources for your customers. CG-NAT doesn&#39;t require anything on the
    CPE side, so it works for most situations where you don&#39;t control the endpoints
    or CPEs.<br /><br />I&#39;m not convinced that the other mechanisms (like 6rd,
    DS-Lite, 464xlat) are much better than CG-NAT, nor do they solve the same set
    of problems<br /><br />Of course, you want to have IPv6 alongside CG-NAT, so clients
    can use native IPv6 where possible. This reduces load on your CG-NAT infrastructure,
    which helps the business case for making IPv6 available to customers.<br /><br
    />Just to be clear, I am a believer in moving to IPv6 wherever possible. I would
    never argue in favour of CG-NAT *instead* of IPv6. Instead I think it&#39;s a
    complementary approach, that helps those ISPs that don&#39;t have massive legacy
    IPv4 allocations.

    html: 'they are. but as it was mentioned these technologies don&#39;t solve the
      biggest problem -&gt; &quot;lack of IPv4 addresses&quot;<br />it&#39;s very
      easy rolling out 6PE/6VPE in ISP core, I&#39;ve seen both of these in my previous
      companies. <br />but it&#39;s a real challenge rolling out IPv6 for residential
      customers. I&#39;ve seen CG-NAT and DS-Lite but also need to read about MAP,
      not familiar with this one  '

  html: What about 6PE and 6VPE, are these solutions being widely deployed out there?

  html: At some point it will move to &quot;just deploy native IPv6 and outsource
    IPv4 to a specialised company that offers NAT64/MAP/DS-Lite/etc services over
    the top&quot;.
