(Used OS for special purpose devices)<br />OK over 4 years ago the awareness of the buffer size of 4k grew per Ubuntu&#39;s records.<br />Cisco chose to do nothing.<br />This seems to me to be working as designed. an ID10T (ID Ten T problem)<br />So to refer to it as a BUG is not nice and disrespects the work of thise who have gone before us.",
