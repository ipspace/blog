      I&#39;m just too tired - can you help me?

    html: I&#39;ve learned to spend time efficiently. I simply avoid learning when
      I&#39;m tired.<br />I can&#39;t think &quot;deeply&quot; and learn with a tired
      brain.<br /><br />So a fresh brain for learning and a tired brain for rutine
      stuff,- could be cleaning the house or doing things I know inside-out.<br /><br
      />After learning this the hard way, I avoid much frustration, spending hours
      and days without progress.

  html: 'Ivan,<br /><br />On one hand you mentioned that application should detect
    the network requirements and another hand we push application developers to work
    on L3 only network. Isn&#39;t this contradiction? '
