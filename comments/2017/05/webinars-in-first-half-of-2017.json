          "html": "Very good point. The &quot;New&quot; tab was designed when I was doing 1 webinar a month and should cover ~2 weeks at the current pace of content publishing (yes, it&#39;s getting crazy), but that&#39;s definitely way too little. Would it make sense to restructure that tab to show webinars that were changed in the last N months?",

      "html": "I have a problem with tracking changes in webminar management system. After login I go to the &#39;New &#39; tab and see the last changes. I have to do it every day because I cannot see the history - I can see what happened that fits one page (usually last two updates where an update mean what was published in one day).<br /><br />I would suggest to add change history tab which covers at least few months i.e. what was updated during a few months.",
