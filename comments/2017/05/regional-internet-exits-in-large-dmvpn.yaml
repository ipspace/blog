    html: In principle, yes. In practice, I haven&#39;t worked enough with LISP to
      answer.

    html: Thanks for your fast answer. Doing more LISP is on my bucket list. Maybe
      I will have some time to do some labs.

  html: Nice post.<br /><br />I&#39;m pretty sure I missed something and I saw the
    DMVPN condition. But I&#39;m studying about a LISP solution. Would it be possible
    to solve it with LISP? Do you have any experience with LISP and security?

  html: Just an idea, would it work with BGP Communities? Each regional Internet Exit
    announce Default Route with a Region Community and all spokes only import default
    route for their specific region community.
