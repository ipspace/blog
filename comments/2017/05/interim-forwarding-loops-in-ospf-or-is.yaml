  html: It is always worth connecting sniffer during failure &amp; recovery tests
    to see what is going on under the hood (in my work is a standard part of system
    development process).<br />It is exciting to see something interesting, then assess
    if it is as expected. I do see all kind of micro loops during such tests (it&#39;s
    interesting to see ospf split-brain scenario where the DR/BR are in one part of
    the split network and the other needs to re-elect the DR/BR then what happens
    after we merge this halves of the network).<br /><br />In real business we simply
    measure the re-convergence time to see if we comply with real requirements.
