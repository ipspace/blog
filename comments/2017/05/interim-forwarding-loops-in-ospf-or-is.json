I do see all kind of micro loops during such tests (it&#39;s interesting to see ospf split-brain scenario where the DR/BR are in one part of the split network and the other needs to re-elect the DR/BR then what happens after we merge this halves of the network).<br /><br />In real business we simply measure the re-convergence time to see if we comply with real requirements.",
