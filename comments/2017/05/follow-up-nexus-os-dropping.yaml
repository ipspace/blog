  html: Thank you Ivan on following up on this. Good to see that Cisco is paying attention
    to the user community! This bug has bit me in the butt once or twice already,
    thankfully with no operational effect.

    channels.

    html: Something is dropping random characters received over a reliable (TCP) session.
      I call that a bug. So did everyone else - that&#39;s why they opened a bug report
      and fixed it. Putting a lipstick on this pig won&#39;t make it nicer.

  html: Let&#39; see if I have this story straight:<br />One frequently needs to make
    a choice about buffer sizes when coding.<br />Someone made a choice of 4k for
    the kernel buffer allocated for reading from console.<br />Someone who paid no
    attention to any of this facilitated the ability to easily &quot;buffer overflow&quot;
    the read from console buffer. (Used OS for special purpose devices)<br />OK over
    4 years ago the awareness of the buffer size of 4k grew per Ubuntu&#39;s records.<br
    />Cisco chose to do nothing.<br />This seems to me to be working as designed.
    an ID10T (ID Ten T problem)<br />So to refer to it as a BUG is not nice and disrespects
    the work of thise who have gone before us.
