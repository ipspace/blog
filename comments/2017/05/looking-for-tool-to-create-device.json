      "html": "A few months back I talked to our implementation engineers if they did any Ansible or Python templating when rolling out Nexus configs to clients.  The answer was no but they used an Excel spreadsheet and some other program that somehow pulled the data out of the spreadsheet to insert in a template.  The problem is that there was a ton of manual fixing of the script they had to do afterwards.<br /><br />Enter Ansible and the &quot;xls_to_facts&quot; module I found.  Since spreadsheets were already a familiar data store, I stuck with that.  I created tabs for various features (global config items, AAA, users, VLANs, VRFs, etc.) then wrote the Jinja to insert the data if it was defined in the spreadsheet, otherwise skip that section of the script.  You could keep it as simple as needed or define a lot of stuff.",

      "html": "We implemented automation for our systems (100-800 devices are controlled this way) more than 10 years ago. At that time we decided to store data in xml files, use apache velocity template language (funny?) and glue them using java-based GUI. <br />Customer express what he/she wants to change in the system (add new system components - not router or switch!) and this request through the GUI sparks actions. As a consequence many networking devices are configured using templates to fullfil the system change required by the Customer. <br /><br />It&#39;s another use of automation implemented many years ago.<br /><br />Side note: automation has been always used in big vendors testing labs - I spent more than 12 years in such environments where hundreds of devices are configured at once.
