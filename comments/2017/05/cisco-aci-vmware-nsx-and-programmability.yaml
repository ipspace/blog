    html: Interestingly, I&#39;m sitting in a PowerShell session at this very moment
      ;) Yes, PowerShell is great for configuring vSphere and NSX objects, but if
      you want to start from application deployment recipe, there&#39;s still some
      glue to be deployed.

    html: Brings to mind your recent podcasts talking about SaltStack and StackStorm,
      doesn&#39;t it? ;)

  html: Would it make sense to start with the tools that are already used in this
    environment to deploy and configure the rest of the application stack, and see
    if you can extend / complement them to include the networking piece?<br /><br
    />P.S. AFAIK there is very good coverage for vSphere and NSX-v (through PowerNSX)
    in PowerShell.

  html: Azure Stack supports the resource template deployment model from Azure. That
    coupled with PowerShell DSC can build and control the configuration drift  of
    really complex topologies/architecture. <br /><br />How do you do it right now?
    You need developers.
