      "html": "Ivan, in some industries we suffer from a chronic abundance of massive legacy applications (think healthcare).  There are a significant number of complex business constraints which prevent or delay addressing critical issues like BC/DR and HA at the application layer.  These powerful forces push us to \u201cfind the solution to world peace in the networking layer\u201d.  I appreciate your point that there are problems with stretched overlay \u201csolutions&quot;/hacks, but in the real world do organizations really have any better choices at this point in time?<br /><br /> -iain",
