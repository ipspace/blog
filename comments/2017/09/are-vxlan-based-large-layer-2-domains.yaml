    html: Iain,<br /><br />Stretching L2 domains within a DC is a bad practice but
      manageable, doing so between DC&#39;s is asking for troubles...<br />Keep you
      vendors under pressure - they should fix their stuff rather you working around
      it.    <br />Have boundaries, interworking points rather than stretched flat
      L2 networks, think L2 or L2oL3(ala VxLAN) -&gt; EVPN between DC&#39;s, gives
      you BUM control, potential localization of failure domains

    html: Not an easy sell when you&#39;re dealing with major healthcare application
      vendors who are still using protocols like SMBv1. &quot;If the mountain will
      not come to Mohammed, Mohammed will go to the mountain&quot;

  html: "Ivan, in some industries we suffer from a chronic abundance of massive legacy\
    \ applications (think healthcare).  There are a significant number of complex\
    \ business constraints which prevent or delay addressing critical issues like\
    \ BC/DR and HA at the application layer.  These powerful forces push us to \u201C\
    find the solution to world peace in the networking layer\u201D.  I appreciate\
    \ your point that there are problems with stretched overlay \u201Csolutions&quot;/hacks,\
    \ but in the real world do organizations really have any better choices at this\
    \ point in time?<br /><br /> -iain"

  html: with control in picture, vxlan is not much different than l2vpn, I think people
    never afraid of stretch l2vpn across wan.<br /><br />failure domain is when device
    hit it&#39;s bottle neck, usually vender don&#39;t tell their limit, and people
    will have to learn these in a hard way and unfortunately apply the so called experience
    to wrong place.<br /><br />now a days, we have network automation, rich telemetry,
    and even data analytics, may be vxlan everywhere might just work, we just need
    think out of box and might learn few automation tools, :)<br />
