We use global addressing for this dynamic range peering.<br />Neighbor 2001::/64  sample config <br /><br />Backend to the servers : dynamic IPv6 ibgp peering for /64. The rest /64 would be eui64 format.<br />Bgppeering on servers runs on static configuration because range cannot form neighborhsip on both sides.<br /><br />Link local is fine but we need dynamic bgp peering and hence needed global addressing and server address  would be in the  same range as on th  vlan /64 address. <br /><br />Seamless running on bgp. <br /><br />Link local is link specific and may not be useful for dynamic peering.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />",

The ToR does summarize /64&#39;s into shorter block, and so on.<br /><br />The major benefit is being able to allocate IP per process/container/etc. I think one of the Google&#39;s paper was open to admit that going with IP per box for Borg and then juggling available ports per process/container was a major pain.",

For link locals - those can be also statically configured, say by encoding the server# within a rack.",
