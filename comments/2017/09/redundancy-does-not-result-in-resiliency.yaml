    html: 'The relation is simpler: the more probable gray failures are, the more
      likely we&#39;ll end in a weird state where the client and the server can&#39;t
      agree on what needs to be done.'

  html: Your relation of gray failures to byzantine generals was intriguing. Indeed,
    there is some relation (agreement on state ?) but it seems there is no intent
    of communication between the apps and the observer. Food for thought as someone
    used to say...

  html: 'With respect to redundancy - a big deal of long-haul aircrat today are twin-engine
    ones. As opposed to four-engine ones that dominated the market until the arrival
    of the 777.  '

  html: Redundancy gives us more b.w but proper policy engineering and traffic engineering
    of  Aggregate and VIP prefixes will help rerouting affected links across different
    paths. <br />Agreed with states yes we do maintain different rib/fib states at  various
    tiers based on physical presence.<br /> Redundancy is not equal to resiliency
    but redundancy improves fault tolerance if configured with proper policies n traffic
    engineering.<br /><br />Again burst of traffic n rates of various traffic i n
    redundant links utilisation also matters.<br />Resilient always means dedicated
    resiliency but we have shared infrastructure on the actual fabric but on the cluster
    level we do have dedicated n shared.<br /><br />Dedicated resiliency across clusters
    is always possible in certain layers.<br />

    html: 'It depends on the business type. I work for public safety communication
      business where the redundancy is crucial. We spend a lot of effort on designing
      system with very fast recovery time. Here Customers wants us to do such network
      and pay for it. <br /><br />For me general discussion about redundancy makes
      no sense. The topic is so deep and complex (I have been working in this business
      for more than 10 years) and cannot be concluded using general statements. '

  html: True resiliency costs a lot of resource and degrades performance. Even if
    you do things independently, with all kind of diversity, and then make a voting
    an the results, you have to introduce extra delays for concluding the voting.<br
    /><br />There is no free lunch, but solutions are possible. But who wants to pay
    or it?<br />So we are back to imperfect risk analysis... So at least we could
    document due care and keep out the accountable persons from jail... :-) <br /><br
    />Our business is partly about fashion, partly about alibis... Real technology
    expertise is rarely in the focus... :-) <br />
