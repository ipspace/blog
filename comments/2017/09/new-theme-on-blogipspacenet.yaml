    html: You must be using an old browser or an old proxy that cannot handle HTTPS
      algorithms used by CloudFlare. A few years back I considered that a showstopper,
      and decided not to have TLS on blog.ipspace.net. Now it&#39;s 2017...

    html: Tried to solve the problem, but there&#39;s nothing I can do if your browser
      or proxy doesn&#39;t work with ECDSA certificates. The only thing I could do
      was to make it suck less by hiding massive icons and adding a line saying &quot;CSS
      failed to load...&quot; Thanks again for reporting this one!

  html: It&#39;s, uh, perhaps a bit broken at the moment. Should all the icons be
    massive? And white background, basic serif fonts, blue underlined links?

    html: Interestingly, header image is served by Cloudflare, so I&#39;d guess there&#39;s
      enough bitrate at the server end ;) They are massive though, asked the designers
      to reduce them.<br /><br />As for pixelation - that was the best photo of me
      presenting we could find anywhere :((<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback!

  html: Looks good, but you might want to throw a little more bitrate at the header
    image with yourself in it, looks pixelated and bitrate starved.

  html: The favicon icon is now the standard Blogger icon instead of your old icon.  Makes
    it more difficult to locate the tabs I have open for your site in my browser.  (For
    www.ipspace.net, I still get the old icon, but not for blog.ipspace.net.)<br /><br
