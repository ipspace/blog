         "html": "Evolution is an iterative process and while I&#39;m a huge fan of RFC1925, after &quot;N&quot; attempts at tackling the issue, some progress is eventually made.  With the same logic / skepticism we would have never seen planes after centuries of failures.<br /><br />That being said, I agree that &quot;intent networking&quot; has a lot of hype to it and that there are no shortage of opportunists to take advantage of it.<br /><br />Last week as part of Future:Net, a full block of the conference was on that topic with interesting research and attempts at solving the problem.  2 broad focus areas: &quot;implementing intent&quot; and &quot;verifying / validating&quot; that what you wanted as an intent is indeed what got deployed with the later accounting for the bulk of the talks.<br /><br />Dr David Cheriton developed an analogy that hit home for me to explain “intent”. He used a comparison with programming languages that evolved from assembly language, to structure languages such a C / C++, etc which slowly abstracted things like registers and memory locations, introduced libraries, etc. to eventually end up with things like SQL where instructions are literally “give me all records containing Bob” that has no ties back to where the data resides, how it is stored, its format, etc.  To link it back to networking, we are still pretty much at the C / C++ level of abstraction.<br /><br />Will we get it right this time?  Who knows but I&#39;m not overly optimistic.  Is the need real and the work / efforts put in it useful ? absolutely.  There are some good minds looking at this and while we &quot;practitioners&quot; often dismiss the objectives of these researches as &quot;unicorns&quot; because of the battle scars accunulated from operating networks (rule #4), I got some nuggets out of it even if it is possibly just to cut thru the BS presented by vendors.<br />",

It&#39;s painful to see how many people get sold on purely marketing material.<br /><br />That said, I am a fan of the concept of Intent as I first heard of which was at the ON Lab. It would be great to configure a network in high level terms rather than configuring each device. On the other side that also seems a little simplistic and superficial for current enterprise needs.",
