            <div class="comment-content">Ivan, in some industries we suffer from a chronic abundance of massive legacy applications (think healthcare).  There are a significant number of complex business constraints which prevent or delay addressing critical issues like BC/DR and HA at the application layer.  These powerful forces push us to “find the solution to world peace in the networking layer”.  I appreciate your point that there are problems with stretched overlay “solutions&quot;/hacks, but in the real world do organizations really have any better choices at this point in time?<br /><br /> -iain</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Iain,<br /><br />Stretching L2 domains within a DC is a bad practice but manageable, doing so between DC&#39;s is asking for troubles...<br />Keep you vendors under pressure - they should fix their stuff rather you working around it.    <br />Have boundaries, interworking points rather than stretched flat L2 networks, think L2 or L2oL3(ala VxLAN) -&gt; EVPN between DC&#39;s, gives you BUM control, potential localization of failure domains</div>

            <div class="comment-content">with control in picture, vxlan is not much different than l2vpn, I think people never afraid of stretch l2vpn across wan.<br /><br />failure domain is when device hit it&#39;s bottle neck, usually vender don&#39;t tell their limit, and people will have to learn these in a hard way and unfortunately apply the so called experience to wrong place.<br /><br />now a days, we have network automation, rich telemetry, and even data analytics, may be vxlan everywhere might just work, we just need think out of box and might learn few automation tools, :)<br /></div>
