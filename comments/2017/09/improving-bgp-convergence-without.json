      "html": "TCP keepalive- and hold-timers aren&#39;t interesting. As the article states: don&#39;t mess with them. Use something else to detect if a neighbor is down. This has been known for over 20 years.<br /><br />Questions that I find much more interesting are about the minimum route advertisement interval (MRAI).<br /><br />I think the MRAI has a much larger impact on BGP convergence. Certainly on global convergence (involving more than 1 AS). The default value for MRAI is recommended to be 30 seconds for eBGP and 5 seconds for iBGP. Do all implementations follow that recommendation ? (I know of at least one implementation that sets both eBGP and iBGP MRAI to 30 seconds). Do people configure smaller values, like e.g. 1 second MRAI on all their peers ? Did anyone ever get into problems because of that ? Is the improvement noticeable ?",
