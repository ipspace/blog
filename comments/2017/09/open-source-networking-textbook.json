I have heard discussions about a good book being comparable to publishing 10 top-tier journal papers (note that a journal paper can imply 1/2 - 1 year of research work) with respect to merit and promotion. The economic benefit in this case comes from the academic promotion, not from the book sales which are devoured by the publisher. <br /><br />As I read somewhere else &quot;I didn&#39;t want to go on an academic career. Academics are paid on citations, not on dollars&quot;. :/",

I am just in the process of paying $1K+ for my son&#39;s books, for one semester, and still not done (at an US college, if not obvious for international audience, where tuition is also in many tens of $Ks)...",

The code itself, if to be acquired through the likes of Amazon, is more expensive than the book (!?!). But this was not the purpose of Ivan&#39;s original point, so maybe I should not have hi-jacked the thread. I&#39;ll stop here",
