            <div class="comment-content">Your relation of gray failures to byzantine generals was intriguing. Indeed, there is some relation (agreement on state ?) but it seems there is no intent of communication between the apps and the observer. Food for thought as someone used to say...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The relation is simpler: the more probable gray failures are, the more likely we&#39;ll end in a weird state where the client and the server can&#39;t agree on what needs to be done.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Redundancy gives us more b.w but proper policy engineering and traffic engineering of  Aggregate and VIP prefixes will help rerouting affected links across different paths. <br />Agreed with states yes we do maintain different rib/fib states at  various tiers based on physical presence.<br /> Redundancy is not equal to resiliency but redundancy improves fault tolerance if configured with proper policies n traffic engineering.<br /><br />Again burst of traffic n rates of various traffic i n redundant links utilisation also matters.<br />Resilient always means dedicated resiliency but we have shared infrastructure on the actual fabric but on the cluster level we do have dedicated n shared.<br /><br />Dedicated resiliency across clusters is always possible in certain layers.<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">True resiliency costs a lot of resource and degrades performance. Even if you do things independently, with all kind of diversity, and then make a voting an the results, you have to introduce extra delays for concluding the voting.<br /><br />There is no free lunch, but solutions are possible. But who wants to pay or it?<br />So we are back to imperfect risk analysis... So at least we could document due care and keep out the accountable persons from jail... :-) <br /><br />Our business is partly about fashion, partly about alibis... Real technology expertise is rarely in the focus... :-) <br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">It depends on the business type. I work for public safety communication business where the redundancy is crucial. We spend a lot of effort on designing system with very fast recovery time. Here Customers wants us to do such network and pay for it. <br /><br />For me general discussion about redundancy makes no sense. The topic is so deep and complex (I have been working in this business for more than 10 years) and cannot be concluded using general statements. </div>
