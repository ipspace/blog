    html: No, assuming you&#39;re running an underlying IGP to resolve next hops.

  html: Thanks for bringing up this topic.<br /><br />Do you see any reason why one
    would need multi-hop BFD for IBGP? I mean for the convergence speed up purpose?

    html: We covered some of that in Leaf-and-Spine Fabric Designs webinar (non-redundant
      L3 connectivity section)

  html: BTW. Do you have any webminar about BGP in Data Center or in the Enterprise.
    I mean BGP used not for the Internet connectivity. I am especially interested
    with resilience and convergence time improvements. I am  Wedminar subscriber but
    I have problems with finding particular webminar....

    html: It obviously depends on (A) BGP RIB size, (B) CPU power and (C) quality
      of your BGP implementation. Dinesh Dutt (Cumulus) is recommending setting advertisement
      interval to 0 when using BGP within the data center. See https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=Clos#L3_SINGLE

  html: 'TCP keepalive- and hold-timers aren&#39;t interesting. As the article states:
    don&#39;t mess with them. Use something else to detect if a neighbor is down.
    This has been known for over 20 years.<br /><br />Questions that I find much more
    interesting are about the minimum route advertisement interval (MRAI).<br /><br
    />I think the MRAI has a much larger impact on BGP convergence. Certainly on global
    convergence (involving more than 1 AS). The default value for MRAI is recommended
    to be 30 seconds for eBGP and 5 seconds for iBGP. Do all implementations follow
    that recommendation ? (I know of at least one implementation that sets both eBGP
    and iBGP MRAI to 30 seconds). Do people configure smaller values, like e.g. 1
    second MRAI on all their peers ? Did anyone ever get into problems because of
    that ? Is the improvement noticeable ?'
