            <div class="comment-content">I don&#39;t think this is fair (quite the opposite), and I thought that the common case was to receive a very small compensation, but it is not so strange in the academic world. <br /><br />Professors are promoted based on their publications, and publishing a book with a reputed publisher is a very valuable merit for promotions. I have heard discussions about a good book being comparable to publishing 10 top-tier journal papers (note that a journal paper can imply 1/2 - 1 year of research work) with respect to merit and promotion. The economic benefit in this case comes from the academic promotion, not from the book sales which are devoured by the publisher. <br /><br />As I read somewhere else &quot;I didn&#39;t want to go on an academic career. Academics are paid on citations, not on dollars&quot;. :/</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Somehow this [book cost estimate] twisted a knife in an open wound, as far as I am concerned (not related to the topic of networking :-)). I am just in the process of paying $1K+ for my son&#39;s books, for one semester, and still not done (at an US college, if not obvious for international audience, where tuition is also in many tens of $Ks)...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I highly recommend buying used or renting textbooks through Amazon.  They even buy them back (usually).  My kids have saved a lot of money this way.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">They became much more &quot;creative&quot; lately - these books come with access codes for the web hosted homework, etc. Amazon rentals did not come with the code, for the ones I had to acquire. The code itself, if to be acquired through the likes of Amazon, is more expensive than the book (!?!). But this was not the purpose of Ivan&#39;s original point, so maybe I should not have hi-jacked the thread. I&#39;ll stop here</div>
