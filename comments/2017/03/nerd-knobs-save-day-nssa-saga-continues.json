Probably impossible to implement 15 years ago, but definitely running production today.<br /><br />Also, while I&#39;m positive Telecom Italia&#39;s network works great, it just means they haven&#39;t hit the right sequence of failures yet ;) <br /><br />Anyway, after realizing how complex NSSA areas are, I&#39;m not touching them again.",

      "html": "&quot;Don\u2019t use OSPF areas if you can avoid them. Don\u2019t use NSSA areas&quot;. As usual, it depends. If you make a good design I do not see big problems. Telecom Italia IP networks, which is definitely not a small network (500+ P+PE routers) has an OSPF multiarea architecture with 66 NSSA areas. It has been working great for more than 15 years without any (OSPF) problems. Lesson to be learned (IMHO): always use the KISS principle.",

      "html": "Hello Ivan,<br /><br />First I would like to thank you for all the great blog posts you are constantly producing. I find  them as great source of knowledge and great place to find the perspective of a notorious engineer. <br /><br />I have the following question/s which I know the best answer is &quot;it depends&quot;, no I will ask, so...<br /><br />What are the biggest signs that your OSPF flat Area 0 is getting to large, how we can adequately judge it? Is there a moment where you can certainly would say - &quot;enough is enough&quot; and I mean before the big meltdown, which inevitably will happen, it is just a matter of the right consequence of the right events? Different people, vendors, books says differently. I know 5-10-15 years ago was different than today, given the fact of the bare CPU and RAM power of nowadays devices, but anyway, what is your vision on this topic?",
