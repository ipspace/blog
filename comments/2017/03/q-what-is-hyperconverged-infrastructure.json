      "html": "I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m just a grumpy old sysadmin, but I find HCI to be a tad over rated.  I think anyone that\u2019s being honest with themselves is only picking HCI because it makes the admins life \u201ceasier\u201d, but it\u2019s not even close to being more cost efficient, performant or scalable compared to the good \u2018ol three tier architecture (i.e. SAN).  <br /><br />Storage and compute now must scale together.  Yes, you can have storage heavy and compute heavy nodes, but then that starts making things not only more confusing, but also potentially less performant (depends on the solution).  Storage and compute now must share a life cycle, and that sucks.  I replace my storage maybe every 5 years, I replace my compute every 2 \u2013 4.  Compute and storage now become a tier all together.  Meaning if you want spinning disk and all flash, you need different clusters.  That terribly inefficient from a compute cost perspective.  The number of nodes you need to have a reasonable level of resiliency is at least three, one + n2. <br /><br />For me, I\u2019m gonna stick with Nimble Storage, Pure Storage, or any other shared storage solution that lets me keep my various infrastructure layers separate and scale independently as needed.  I\u2019d bet a good steak, my infrastructure performs better and costs less too.<br /><br />That said, VDI and web scale are the two areas where I WOULD run HCI, but I would need a pretty massive environment for it to be worth it.  SMB\u2019s or smaller sites may also be another good fit.  Full size enterprise though, I think SAN/NAS still makes more sense.  <br />",
