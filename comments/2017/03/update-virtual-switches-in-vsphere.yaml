  html: My brain throws an exception whenever I encounter &quot;moving forward&quot;
    and &quot;leverage&quot; :-)<br /><br />Kidding aside, makes (business) sense
    from VMware&#39;s perspective, I guess.<br /><br />Talking from my perspective,
    I always stress that it&#39;s wise to evaluate how much you&#39;re going to regret
    vendor lock-in versus vendor agnostic (once more went over that during a presentation
    I gave today). Not saying of course one shouldn&#39;t buy products &amp; services
    like ACI &amp; NSX, plenty valid use cases, but as engineers and architects I
    feel we have to obligation to look critically in what is offered and if it addresses
    the actual customer needs (problems ?).<br /><br />
