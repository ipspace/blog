            <div class="comment-content">&quot;Don’t use OSPF areas if you can avoid them. Don’t use NSSA areas&quot;. As usual, it depends. If you make a good design I do not see big problems. Telecom Italia IP networks, which is definitely not a small network (500+ P+PE routers) has an OSPF multiarea architecture with 66 NSSA areas. It has been working great for more than 15 years without any (OSPF) problems. Lesson to be learned (IMHO): always use the KISS principle.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;ve heard of SP networks running over a 1000 routers in a single area (not sure whether it was IS-IS or OSPF). Probably impossible to implement 15 years ago, but definitely running production today.<br /><br />Also, while I&#39;m positive Telecom Italia&#39;s network works great, it just means they haven&#39;t hit the right sequence of failures yet ;) <br /><br />Anyway, after realizing how complex NSSA areas are, I&#39;m not touching them again.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hello Ivan,<br /><br />First I would like to thank you for all the great blog posts you are constantly producing. I find  them as great source of knowledge and great place to find the perspective of a notorious engineer. <br /><br />I have the following question/s which I know the best answer is &quot;it depends&quot;, no I will ask, so...<br /><br />What are the biggest signs that your OSPF flat Area 0 is getting to large, how we can adequately judge it? Is there a moment where you can certainly would say - &quot;enough is enough&quot; and I mean before the big meltdown, which inevitably will happen, it is just a matter of the right consequence of the right events? Different people, vendors, books says differently. I know 5-10-15 years ago was different than today, given the fact of the bare CPU and RAM power of nowadays devices, but anyway, what is your vision on this topic?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">It obviously depends on the weakest link (the slowest router in your network) and that could be anything. However, assuming all your gear is no older than a few years, I know people running several hundred routers in a single OSPF area.<br /><br />Anyway, do some link flaps (which will trigger Type-1 LSA flooding, which will trigger full SPF run) and see what CPU utilization you get.</div>
