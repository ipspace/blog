  html: '&quot;I know Cisco (and every other vendor) loves making ever-more-complex
    solutions&quot;<br /><br />I work for a $vendor. I wish I could share the last
    5 RFPs that actually crossed my desk. As long as our customers ask for lock, stock
    &amp; barrel (i.e. contains every possible feature that they might use somewhere
    down the line), which is complaint with every standard out there, while leaving
    all the integration risk with the vendor, all these complex solutions are here
    to stay. <br /><br />Customers need to:<br />1) focus: choose what is important
    and what not<br />2) take responsibility: make your own architectural and design
    decisions'

    html: Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not so much preaching as scratching a really old
      itch (had a few customers like that in my 30+ networking years). BTW, is he
      still around - haven&#39;t heard about him for a long while...

    html: His blog is still there, but he hasn&#39;t posted since August. It appears
      he&#39;s given up on being a Cisco watch dog, and moved on to promoting Reese&#39;s
      Candy full time.
