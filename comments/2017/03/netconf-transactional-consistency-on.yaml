  html: Hi Ivan, the most interesting part, that IOS-XE gives different answers about
    capabilities on 830 port and 22 port, for unknown for me reason ... But good that
    830 port gives you all configuration get-schema capabilities.

  html: Port 22 hosts the legacy netconf agent on IOS-XE, which only supports netconf
    1.0 with a Cisco-proprietary payload (same as all other vendors). Port 830, when
    netconf-yang is enabled, hosts the model-based agent.

  html: Yes, it looks like the port 830 server is an IOS XE implementation of a Tail-F
    Netconf server.<br /><br />It feels kinda like a mini-NCS running on the box and
    you talk to that to configure IOS models which maybe then uses Tail-F algorithms
    to compute required model -&gt; native model changes.<br /><br />Looks like possibly
    Including candidate config datastore also.<br /><br /><br />
