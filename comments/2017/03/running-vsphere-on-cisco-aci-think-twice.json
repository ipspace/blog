Nuage improved it by using SR-IOV on the external VM connection, but still. <br /><br />While it&#39;s easy to make fun of how limited VMware virtual switch is, its performance was always stellar (at least compared to alternatives).<br /><br />Not to mention that this becomes a nightmare to manage, more so as you a different VLAN on every inter-VM connection (or traffic gets bridged before it hits _your_ virtual switch)",

Nuage were doing it because they didn&#39;t have a strong hardware story. Cisco, on the other hand, can ditch the VS altogether and extended these p2p vlans to the hardware switches, similar to what they&#39;re doing with their Neutron plugin. This way they can keep the per-VM granularity with hardware performance. The only price they pay in this case is the ability to innovate and add new features. But like you said, nothing that can&#39;t be fixed with a bit of NAT, PBR and VXLAN",

      "html": "Ivan, I believe you are miss informed. I am not talking specifically about the vSphere API that AVS uses, and the constant rumours about it, but more about ACI in general.<br /><br />It is true that VMware is becoming a company where their technology is increasingly vertically integrated and eventually they want that if you use their hypervisor you have to use their SDN solution and their orchestration system and their VDI and ... I think the market will steer things otherwise \u2026 but we shall see! \ud83d\ude03<br /><br />I don\u2019t know how much of an opportunity you had to have hands-on with ACI recently. I\u2019d love to spend time showing you how some of the things we do with ACI work. Meanwhile I provide here my respectful feedback.<br /><br />I definitely disagree with some comments that you made. Some are in fact open for debate, for instance:<br /><br />\u201cYou can\u2019t do all that on ToR switches, and need control of the virtual switch\u201d.<br /><br />I wouldd say you can do a lot of what you need to do for server networking on a modern ToR. And yet you are right, and you do need a virtual switch. That is clear. How much functionality you put on one vs. another is a subject for debate with pros and cons.<br /><br />But in an SDN world with programmable APIs, it does not mean you need YOUR virtual switch in order to control it. You just need one virtual switch that you can program. That is all.<br /><br />There\u2019s a lot that we can do on AVS that we can do on OVS too. And we do it on OVS too. There\u2019s a lot with do on AVS that we can\u2019t do with VDS. But there\u2019s enough that we can do in VDS so that when combining it with what we do on the ToR we deliver clever things (read more below).<br /><br />The below comment on the other hand is imho misinformed:<br /><br />\u201cThat [running without AVS] would degrade Cisco ACI used in vSphere environments into a smarter L2+L3 data center fabric. Is that worth the additional complexity you get with ACI? &quot;<br /><br />First, it is wrong to assume that in a vSphere environment ACI is no more than smarter L2+L3 data center fabric. But even if it was only that \u2026 it is a WAY smarter L2+L3 fabric.<br /><br />And that leads me to your second phrase. What is up with the \u201cadditional complexity you get with ACI?\u201d.<br /><br />This bugs me greatly. ACI has a learning curve, no doubt. But we need to understand that the line between \u201ccomplex\u201d and \u201cdifferent\u201d is crossed by eliminating ignorance.<br /><br />Anyone that has done an upgrade on anymore than a handful of switches from any vendor and then conducts a network upgrade (or downgrade) on dozens and dozens of switches under APIC control will see how it becomes much simpler.<br /><br />Configuring a new network service involving L2 and L3 across dozens and dozens of switches on multiple data centers is incredibly simpler. Presenting those new networks to multiple vCenters? Piece of cake. Finding a VM on the fabric querying for the VM name? \u2026 done. Reverting the creation on the previously created network service is incredibly simpler too. I mean \u2026 compared to traditional networking \u2026 let me highlight: INCREDIBLY simpler.<br /><br />Changing your routing policies to announce or not specific subnets from your fabric, or making a change in order to upgrade storm control policies to hundreds or thousands of ports, \u2026 or - again - reverting any of those changes, becomes real simple. Particularly when you think how you were doing it on NX-OS or on any other vendor\u2019s box-by-box configuration system.<br /><br />And the truth is that APIC accomplishes all of that, and more, with a very elegant architecture based on distributed intelligence in the fabric combined with a centralised policy and management plane on a scale-out controller cluster.<br /><br />Other vendors require combining six different VM performing three different functions just to achieve a distributed default gateway that is only available to workloads running on a single-vendor hypervisor. Now that\u2019s complex, regardless of how well you know the solution.<br /><br />Full response with details about how we do uSeg with VDS here:<br />http://nillosmind.blogspot.com/2017/03/a-response-to-running-vsphere-on-cisco.html",

          "html": "Ivan,<br /><br />First, AVS is an optional component of ACI. Let me give an example of using vDS and implementing micro-segmentation. <br /><br />And before I do that, let me ask you, why micro-segmentation is only for VMware Vms, why bare metals and containers, and other hypervisors don&#39;t deserve that treatment? That&#39;s what exactly customers get when they deploy ACI, a consistent policy, a consistent micro-segmentation, across all workloads.<br /><br />EPG is micro-segments in ACI. Define any number of them and put them under same BD (a segment). Put contract/policy across them. When using VMware, each EPG will be pushed as separate port-groups and policy enforced by EPG. At the same time flood semantic of BD is maintained across. Same thing works with bare metal, containers, Hyper-V etc. <br /><br />Here is my blog on micro-seg:<br />http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/microsegmentation<br /><br />There are other ways to achieve that in ACI using private vlans but let&#39;s leave it for some other time.<br /><br />If you say &quot;That would degrade Cisco ACI used in vSphere environments into a smarter L2+L3 data center fabric.&quot; Citing this without deep dive is what I&#39;m not happy about.<br /><br />I&#39;m not going to compare feature by feature here; please do a hands on or talk to customers who deployed this.<br /><br />BTW, I&#39;m no longer in Cisco and now I only get news like everybody else does.

And then making sure it all works at scale and hopefully doesn&#39;t change when new technology like container is to be deployed.<br /><br />Please read one of my blogs:<br /><br />http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/aci-the-sdn-purpose-built-for-data-center-operations-and-automation<br /><br />At the end, customer validate the technology and I&#39;m very proud to hear from customers that the ACI is game changer.<br /><br />I&#39;ll close with one paragraph from my blog:<br /><br />&quot;ACI was architected to provide a unified network independent of the type of workload \u2013 bare metal, virtual machine, or container. At the end of the day, workloads are IP endpoints and two IP end points want to connect. They need load balancing, security, and other services. Their life cycle may be static, may need migration, or simply a quick start/stop. ACI handles it all.&quot;",

      "html": "&quot;Update 2017-03-21: As is often the case I stand corrected (thanks to g9ais and Nillo) - you can use PVLAN to pull all traffic out of the hypervisor to the ToR switch, and process it there. I still think there are things that can go wrong with that approach with just the right mix of flooded traffic, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s functionally equivalent to having full control of the virtual switch. Can&#39;t figure out at the moment whether that&#39;s relevant or not - any comment would be highly welcome.&quot;<br /><br />The functionality equivalent to having full control of the virtual switch is definitely not the same. Loosing a host-based local switching and routing is one of the examples. But in this case as Nillo mentioned the traffic optimization here is not the big issue from a practical standpoint. What is a bigger disadvantage from the real-life scenario is a lack of service insertion into the L2 path or intra-L3 subnet path. In theory ACI can use usegments and use contracts between them but still no service insertion into the L2 path. What\u2019s more usegments with so many contracts do not scale even on the next gen 93180YC-EX. In comparison NSX do this natively with many security vendors. Without the effective micro segmentation ACI cannot offer spoofguard to protect against man in the middle attacks or IP address spoofing. The best switch on the market will no see flows which are switched locally on the host. How the security can be fully provided if there is no full visibility of applications running on hosts? So security I would say is the biggest concern in terms of the solution which is hw-switch based not vswitch based.<br /><br />To anticipate some arguments:<br />Yes, NSX-v is for vSphere and NSX-T is for multihypervisor.<br />Yes, I also recommend hardware based solutions where critical apps are on the bare metal.<br />Yes, Visibility of the underlay is not an issue.<br />Yes, Virtual firewalls plays a vital role to protect apps in the virtual environment.<br />Yes, Both NSX and ACI have its own pros and cons. :)",

          "html": "Hi Craig.  I work for vArmour and wanted to correct you on one point.  You&#39;re right about vArmour for the most part, but I think you&#39;re working with somewhat outdated information.  There is no forwarding or offloading to separate FW VMs.  This was the behavior of the system in a previous generation.  The current VXLAN implementation is for control plane only.  Everything inside the hypervisor gets L7 inspected and forwarded on the normal switching path.  This is true regardless of whether it&#39;s deployed in ACI or non-ACI mode.<br /><br />And you&#39;re right about the performance.  With some of Intel&#39;s latest libraries, you can make userspace VMs run pretty fast from an I/O perspective.  8+ Gbps performance per vCPU with application ID and verbose logging with 1500 byte MTU.",

      "html": "Most of our unfortunate coupling of network technologies has been in pursuit of performance. E.g., VMware will talk your ear off about the value of NSX local switching/routing/FW (though they&#39;ll go curiously quiet when working on NSX edge designs).<br /><br />But it seems that with VMXNET3 driver support, DirectPath I/O, SR-IOV, and VXLAN+TCP offload support, we&#39;ve got enough network performance that maybe it&#39;s time to shift all the vSwitch bloat into a VM.<br /><br />vArmour gets by just fine completely with VM-based switching -- they use one VM on each host for traffic interception and redirection. Some traffic is redirected w/VXLAN to the main firewall VMs. Other traffic is forwarded directly to the uplinks or other VMs on the host. Their approach is totally agnostic to the hypervisor vSwitch, so it works with every hypervisor and cloud environment. It doesn&#39;t have the raw speed of heavily-coupled hardware/hypervisor forwarding, but it&#39;s close enough that the only ones who will raise a stink about it are the sales engineers.<br /><br />Cisco did the same thing with Virtual Topology System (VTS) -- it began as a totally decoupled software VXLAN engine with distributed L2 control plane -- perfect for extending L2 between different hypervisors located anywhere in the world. They&#39;ve since spun VTS into something slightly different, but maybe Cisco should bring back and reemphasize its hypervisor-agnostic switching capabilities.",
