      "html": "&quot;I know Cisco (and every other vendor) loves making ever-more-complex solutions&quot;<br /><br />I work for a $vendor. I wish I could share the last 5 RFPs that actually crossed my desk. As long as our customers ask for lock, stock &amp; barrel (i.e. contains every possible feature that they might use somewhere down the line), which is complaint with every standard out there, while leaving all the integration risk with the vendor, all these complex solutions are here to stay. <br /><br />Customers need to:<br />1) focus: choose what is important and what not<br />2) take responsibility: make your own architectural and design decisions",
