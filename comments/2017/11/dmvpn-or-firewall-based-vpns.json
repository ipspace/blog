There were two (main) solution proposals to the problem statement \nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-detienne-dmvpn/ and\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-sathyanarayan-ipsecme-advpn/\nbut there was no standardisation of the solution. So, the problem statement became an RFC and it was left there.</p>\n\n<p>Both options have the draft document in public domain but there are, in fact, more implementations of DMVPN (Juniper, HP, Brocade, Huawei, open source, etc) than ADVPN; just that the names are different.\nAlso, basic DMVPN still uses fully standardised protocols (NHRP, IPsec/IKE, GRE) so an implementation of these as per standards should be able to inter-op. ADVPN, on the other hand uses some notifications/payloads that were never standardised!</p>\n",
