    html: For someone who just started getting familiar with network automation (and
      Python), that might be way too complex (but otherwise I agree with you). Also,
      it&#39;s simpler to troubleshoot a simple Python script than an Ansible module.

  html: I got you&#39;re making the point of how to approach challenges in technology
    and I fully agree with that approach. Start simple and grow.<br />Just like to
    add that depending on the python script you might even want to include it as an
    ansible module, which seems dead easy. http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_modules_general.html

  html: -- Method in madness --<br /><br />Your method is fine but the Ansible tool/language
    seems pretty mad to me.<br />The simple task of reading a file is complicated
    beyond measure.<br />Maybe Ansible has other qualities but even Fortran, invented
    60 yars ago, has simpler input/output syntax!!

    html: '&quot;This is common development practice.&quot; &lt;&lt; Agreed. Unfortunately,
      like with common sense, it&#39;s somewhat rare in the wild ;))<br /><br />Thanks
      for the book reference - will add it to &quot;recommended self-study materials&quot;'

  html: "This is common development practice. It is well explained in the (online\
    \ free) book Think Python, which I found very interesting in this regard. The\
    \ &quot;debug&quot; paragraph on each chapter has real value and the book is worth\
    \ reading even for people who are writing small scripts from time to time.<br\
    \ /><br /> Here is an extract of the book:<br /><br />A development plan<br /><br\
    \ />A development plan is a process for writing programs. The process we used\
    \ in this case study is \u201Cencapsulation and generalization.\u201D The steps\
    \ of this process are:<br /><br />1. Start by writing a small program with no\
    \ function definitions.<br />2. Once you get the program working, encapsulate\
    \ it in a function and give it a name.<br />3. Generalize the function by adding\
    \ appropriate parameters.<br />4. Repeat steps 1\u20133 until you have a set of\
    \ working functions. Copy and paste working code to avoid retyping (and re-debugging).<br\
    \ />5. Look for opportunities to improve the program by refactoring. For example,\
    \ if you have similar code in several places, consider factoring it into an appropriately\
    \ general function.<br /><br />This process has some drawbacks\u2014we will see\
    \ alternatives later\u2014but it can be useful if you don\u2019t know ahead of\
    \ time how to divide the program into functions. This approach lets you design\
    \ as you go along.<br />"
