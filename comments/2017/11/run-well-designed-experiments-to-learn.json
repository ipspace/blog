      "html": "This is common development practice. It is well explained in the (online free) book Think Python, which I found very interesting in this regard. The &quot;debug&quot; paragraph on each chapter has real value and the book is worth reading even for people who are writing small scripts from time to time.<br /><br /> Here is an extract of the book:<br /><br />A development plan<br /><br />A development plan is a process for writing programs. The process we used in this case study is \u201cencapsulation and generalization.\u201d The steps of this process are:<br /><br />1. Start by writing a small program with no function definitions.<br />2. Once you get the program working, encapsulate it in a function and give it a name.<br />3. Generalize the function by adding appropriate parameters.<br />4. Repeat steps 1\u20133 until you have a set of working functions. Copy and paste working code to avoid retyping (and re-debugging).<br />5. Look for opportunities to improve the program by refactoring. For example, if you have similar code in several places, consider factoring it into an appropriately general function.<br /><br />This process has some drawbacks\u2014we will see alternatives later\u2014but it can be useful if you don\u2019t know ahead of time how to divide the program into functions. This approach lets you design as you go along.<br />",
