            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan <br /><br />Few quick thoughts <br /><br />1. In your design , you have suggested Two tor of the rack [ TOR ] switches per rack which is opposed to single ToR which many H.W vendors and service vendors use. <br /><br />If it is two tor switches, we need , L2 Multipathing which is ECMP or NIC Teaming on the servers to the upstream links, vPC in Cisco , and we need Peer link between both the tors if we are decided to use vPC .<br /><br />Two TORs connected to switches is always little quick tricky when it comes to load sharing across the two switches from same server and thats the reason vendors use single tor of rack switch with downstream servers are reside in single VLAN model maintained by spanning tree port-fast edge ports and SVI for downstream server default routes.<br /><br />Two ToRs connected to the servers traffic forwarding path would be based on hashing across the tuples on the LACP or vPC .<br /><br /><br />2. Second thought would be why are we extending Layer 2 from ToR to Aggregation even if we have around &lt;200 servers. <br />Every design we do is with respect to number of servers , redundancy paths &amp; fault domain maintenance across the fabric design ,<br />Doesnt matter whether we have &lt;200 and &gt; 200 , we should prefer using Layer 3 from ToR to aggregation to Core and Layer 2 stands downstream on VLAN interfaces [ SVI ] for Default addressing on the TORs .<br /><br />Use DHCPrelay for Ipv4 address and SLAAC for IPv6 addressing and peer&amp; dynamic BGP peering downstream to maintain the content prefixes. <br /><br />3. Prefix Limit and Prefix Aggregation is something which is required to be done on the aggregation on number of prefixes based on TCAM sizing and also Overlaying one over the other. <br /><br />4. Equidistant forwarding topology [ folded CLOS or fat tree ] which is important in maintaining end to end delays or RTTs. Scaling horizontally or scaling north-south or Scale Out  is what is preferred over  Scale Up for the sheer reason that the failure domain is covered with north-south link/nodes and still maintain the same equidistant hop and delay which nowadays is &lt;2ms for VM to VM traffic. <br /><br />Customer needs are simple as they need predictable delay in their application with ever improving goodput. <br /><br /><br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">Agreed totally. Does L2 solutions are preferred over L3. Can you specify a L2 usecase which i would like a take a look.<br /><br />768k MAC is the numbers that is supported on recent chipsets shouldnt be a problem.<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">What is the use case for EVPN. <br /><br />Are we trying to run Ethernet VPN as overlay between ToR and Core. Infra has to support MPLS . IP based EVPN implementation is something which is not there if i am not wrong. <br /><br />Always EVPN, Bridged services has to run on top of infrastructure services such as MPLS. IP services are more ride on top of GRE,IPSec , IPinIP which doesnt require MPLS support. <br /><br />EVPN certainly requires MPLS as infra service. <br /><br />Can you brief more on EVPN use case on the DC Fabric Infra. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">Another important point to consider when designing is Oversubscription ratio on Tor to aggregation in your design and also Oversubscription ratio on Three stage CLOS or five stage CLOS.<br /><br />TOR to CLuster Spine is 3:1 and CLuster SPine to DC Spine is 4:1 and DC Spine to Regional Spine is 2:1 .<br /><br />2.Port density [ 10G,25G,40G,50G,100G ] has to be scaled on the ports , deep buffers for different set of applications for mixed mode traffic , incast , anycast , elephant flows and mice flows.<br /><br />3. Burst , Buffer &amp; B.W considerations , Flow mappings within each queues and strict prioritization across the flows are the features that is required in the ToR.  TOR layer design to spine always features that is required to handle burst and handle failure points and also redundancy model on the tors</div>

            <div class="comment-content">BGP works on per prefix topology and per prefix capacity. <br />Per Prefix Capacity is determined by advertisements over that particular link/neighbor and the neighbor uses the link which the neighbor is connected and that link has to have the burst/buffer considerations. <br /><br />BGP doesnt work on links but the nighbor use the links where it received the prefix by next hop population to an interface and thats the thought that i brought in for oversubscription per prefix rite. <br /><br />Oversubscription per prefix advertised by BGP. <br /><br />One more question <br /><br />1. Does MLAG scenarios support the peer link between the two ToR switches. </div>
