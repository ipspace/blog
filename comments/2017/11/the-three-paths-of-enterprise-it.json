      "html": "The caveat I would make on the enterprise is the degree to which the apps and infrastructure in the datacenter are viewed as cost centers or revenue generators. For those who generate revenue, the size, scale, variability of the workload, and if they started down the revenue path prior or post ~2009ish seems to dictate quite a few of the cloud vs private datacenter builds. <br /><br />Good article on why being a revenue generator is a tough transition for many: http://www.leanessays.com/2017/11/the-cost-center-trap.html",

      "html": "One thing that seems missing is the Enterprise Networks core mission - to serve campus/office network connection to local resources, remote resources (on premise, hyper-converged or in private/public cloud) and connection to Internet. It assumes the use of &quot;old&quot; well-know tiered architecture with more focus on wireless and security. It will get faster 2.5/5G to access with 40/100G to core, accommodate BYOD but will still exist for a longer time. Maybe 5G or nG networks will eliminate it some days and make every office virtual. So, I think, we will be dealing with SP, Enterprise and DC networks for a while.",
