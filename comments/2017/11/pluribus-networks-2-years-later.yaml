  html: "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />This is Marco Pessi with Pluribus. Thanks for your article\
    \ first of all!<br />I do not think you have misunderstood anything from the NFD16\
    \ session. The content and presenters were chosen to provide a comprehensive overview\
    \ of our different technologies to the broad NFD community, as we thought that,\
    \ after a long 2.5 years break, there was a need to start over. <br /><br />We\
    \ were also aware that this would have led to some information gaps, and unfortunately\
    \ the technical documentation on our website is too incomplete (and I really have\
    \ to apologize for that), to be used to complement the information you grasped\
    \ during our presentation.<br /><br />Let me make two quick comments: (1) we do\
    \ have an EVPN gateway in our roadmap and (2) we support write-read partitions\
    \ for our fabric.<br />I will post a new comment when more documentation will\
    \ be available and/or hopefully we will be able to demo/discuss these topics at\
    \ next NFD<br /><br />Let me make now two longer comments:<br />(1) Regarding\
    \ your statement that CPUs are &quot;laughably slow\u201D\u2026please note that\
    \ the new generation of white boxes based on Broadwell have server grade operating\
    \ systems and can provide flow telemetry for 5000 sessions per second. We do provide\
    \ our own brite-boxes with slightly different components and that enable additional\
    \ CPU lines available on certain merchant silicon asic. This results in additional\
    \ capabilities: L4-L7 flow analytics and, on the networking side, increased virtualization\
    \ capacity, for example: number of containers (router instances)<br /><br />(2)\
    \ I am not sure I follow your comment about Pluribus fabric being useful only\
    \ to who is not good at automating. Pluribus fabric presents a high level abstraction\
    \ of network objects, that can be managed with either CLI or REST API. For example,\
    \ a subnet with anycast gateway is a single object (provisioned with either a\
    \ single configuration line or REST API command), versus a single object on every\
    \ switch for the majority of other vendor implementations: programming a network\
    \ of 40 switches and 400 subnets with Pluribus requires provisioning 400 objects,\
    \ with other vendors it is 16000 objects: if you allow me the analogy, it is a\
    \ bit like scripting versus programming with Assembly. I agree I can do more damage\
    \ with a higher level of abstraction, but my point is that handling exceptions\
    \ and troubleshooting inconsistencies with a huge provisioning state is no fun\
    \ either and results in higher operational costs.<br />My opinion is that good\
    \ automation can hardly solve problems of poorly programmable components: automation\
    \ works well if it is holistically implemented at all components and layers. One\
    \ of our goals at Pluribus is to provide a consistent and programmable network\
    \ layer using white/brite boxes.<br />Still, to your point, if customers have\
    \ already invested in an automation framework that relies on box-by-box management\
    \ and do not see enough value in the fabric, we can provide a cheaper Netvisor\
    \ license that does not include the fabric.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my comments\
    \ and looking forward to hosting you again at our offices (and please feel comfortable\
    \ to wear anything you like!)<br /><br />Best!<br />~Marco"
