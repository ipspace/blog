      "html": "&gt; it makes sense to automate repeatable tasks<br /><br />There&#39;s another aspect of it, though.  Even it is a one-off task that will only be applied to a single machine, if you have that configuration in your Puppet/Chef/Ansible/whatever manifests/playbook, you will automatically have *documented* it, just be it being in the manifests.<br /><br />Also, even if you are certain something will only ever apply to a single machine, you may suddenly find yourself needing to rebuild/replace that machine, and then it is no longer one-off.<br /><br />And once you are able to rebuild your servers/routers/switches at will, you will find uses for that.  For example building test machines that are identically configured to your production machines, enabling you to do non-disruptive testing of changes (e.g. software updates).",
