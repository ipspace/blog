    html: I would consider that &quot;just because you could doesn&#39;t mean that
      you should&quot; scenario. In any case, it&#39;s just moving the problem by
      creating another layer of indirection. RFC 1925 has plenty to say about that
      as does RFC 6670.

    html: '&quot;Scenario 2&quot; is not supported by VMware because it places a storage
      vmkernel adapter on a NSX Logical Switch (VXLAN). '

    html: So, I am the guy who talked about this with Ivan and we had that option
      but VMware would heavily recommend against it .. :)

    html: 'Nutanix doesnt need storage VMK adapters - There is lots of misinformation
      / ignorance on what Nutanix needs vs what NSX needs here. '

  html: Nutanix has &quot;published&quot; that it can be used over NSX. The option
    to not need L2 in the underlay ist called &quot;Scenario 2 - NSX for the Nutanix
    CVM and User VMs&quot; in http://next.nutanix.com/t5/Nutanix-Connect-Blog/VMware-NSX-on-Nutanix-Build-a-Software-Defined-Datacenter/ba-p/7590<br
    /><br />The two scenarios above are published as &quot;validated&quot; by Nutanix
    at http://next.nutanix.com/t5/Nutanix-Connect-Blog/Nutanix-Validates-Two-Crucial-Deployment-Scenarios-with-VMware/ba-p/7580<br
    /><br />Thanks,<br />Erik

    html: That&#39;s what you get for relying on VMware Technical Marketing documents
      :( Thank you - fixed.

  html: When I built a L3 leaf-spine pod with one subnet per rack, L2 still worked
    within each rack. Since hyperconverged clusters are unlikely to be larger than
    one rack, most deployments might not have to worry about these L2/L3 issues.

  html: "&gt;The overall question would be: why would hyperconverged manufacturers\
    \ have to rely on L2 to build clusters\u2026?<br />Two weeks ago I was part of\
    \ a so called &quot;design&quot; session with a major VMware and storage guy of\
    \ the biggest system house in our country. They told me we need layer 2 connectivity\
    \ for VMware Vmotion. So, now I bought two Trident 2+ stackable switches for each\
    \ rack of those 2 datacenters to get VXLAN up and running"

  html: Btw vMotion does not require L2 since vSphere 6, if you provide the proper
    routing config for the vMotion vmkernel interfaces between hosts that need to
    move VMs around.<br />
