            <div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks for sharing this. When an EVPN route is received with a label field in the NLRI, the BGP speaker must determine whether the route is intended for a VXLAN, MPLS, or SRv6-based service. This distinction is crucial because the interpretation of the label field depends on the encapsulation type: it may represent a 24-bit VNI (VXLAN), a 20-bit MPLS label, or a &quot;transposed&quot; function in SRv6.</p>

<p>RFC 8365 explains that a receiving BGP speaker can identify the intended encapsulation in one of two ways:</p>

<p>1.Through the BGP Encapsulation Extended Community (the standard method used in most implementations), or</p>

<p>2.Via static configuration, which instructs the router to interpret all received EVPN routes using a predefined encapsulation.</p>

<p>This is exactly how it works in both SROS and SR Linux:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>SR Linux uses default-received-encapsulation &lt;mpls|vxlan&gt;, with a default of vxlan.</p></li>
<li><p>SROS uses def-recv-evpn-encap &lt;mpls|vxlan&gt;, with a default of mpls.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Because the default encapsulations differ between the two NOSes, they will behave differently when the BGP Encapsulation Extended Community is missing and you don&#39;t change the defaults.</p>
