The protocol standard should also provide a PICS Proforma. \nThe procurers should ask for the PICS from each vendor. The PICS should be supported by test evidence, not just a statement. Potential deviations should be explained and justified.</p>\n\n<p>That is what you get when you opt for cheap quick and dirty, instead of a proper disciplined engineering design... </p>\n",
