Check out https://github.com/pydantify/pydantify - a python library which converts YANG models into pydantic models.</p>\n\n<p>Example converted models for SR Linux: https://github.com/srl-labs/pydantic-srlinux</p>\n\n<p>Still a bit experimental and it isn&#39;t able to support all features of YANG models, but there is certainly some motivation within the network automation community to try and come up with better tooling for YANG models.</p>\n",

So many gnmi calls just exploring what happens if I send this xpath or that xpath.</p>\n\n<p>Talking about tools, I like gNMIc https://gnmic.openconfig.net/ and the ecosystem around it. Seem solid.</p>\n\n<p>On DevNet you can also find the Cisco Metrics Search Engine https://developer.cisco.com/cmse/ which is nice, but I&#39;m afraid the team might remove it after the lead for the tool was impacted by the last LR (if you like it or not, please share your feedback)</p>\n\n<p>If you work with IOS-XR you can find the yang navigator at https://cfnng.cisco.com/ios-xr/yang-explorer/view-data-model</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer, I work for Cisco.</p>\n",
