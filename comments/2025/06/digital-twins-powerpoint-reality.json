From what I understand, their &ldquo;digital twin&rdquo; is essentially a data model built from configs, telemetry, and other network data. They use it to verify intent and predict issues without simulating the control plane at all. \nDid I get that right, and what&rsquo;s your perspective on that approach?</p>\n",

Based on Linux containers and crpd instances so resource usage is reasonable.</p>\n\n<p>Once spun up I could run our normal automation against the lab instances to get them configured.  Took some fake dns and a bit of messing with the interface names but it works.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously it can&#39;t simulate everything, but I get routing tables that <em>exactly</em> match what we see in production, which allows me to tinker with protocols, policies, link costs or whatever and see <em>exactly</em> what the results would be.  A lot of work and the scope is obviously limited, but it&#39;s been very useful for us.</p>\n",
