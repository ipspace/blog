            <div class="comment-content"><p>Ivan,  does the container in netlab have any dataplane interfaces? I can reliably reproduce this in a ceos-lab image running in gns3, as opposed to netlab, when i instantiate a container with 0 or 1 interfaces.  (e0 would be int ma0, with e1+ being dataplane ports.</p>

<p>I believe this issue isn&#39;t with a vrf with no interfaces, it&#39;s that there are no interfaces at all so the container image doesn&#39;t spin up the virtual asic.</p>

<p>I do agree though that perhaps the error could be refined a little.</p>
