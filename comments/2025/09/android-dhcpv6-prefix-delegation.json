The whole promise of answering &quot;/64&quot; to every &quot;how big should this segment be?&quot; question now goes out the window.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re running a sizable campus network and you assume the worst-case (every device is an android device), then we&#39;re back to playing &quot;right sizing&quot; games just with prefixes instead of addresses. Or you can just pretend that IPv6 addresses only has 64 bits and then re-adopt IPv4 thinking.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at an example -- In your address plan, if you had assigned a /48 to each building and used 8 bits for &quot;function&quot; and 8 bits for an instance (in case you needed multiple VLANs to deal with broadcast domain size), then you can really only assume 250 devices for android in any given function, which isn&#39;t a lot.</p>\n\n<p>Now realistically, most big networks I know of tunnel wireless traffic to a central controller cluster, which helps if had a big &#39;ol &quot;reserved for future use&quot; in the top level of your address plan that you can devote to Android.</p>\n\n<p>My ranting aside, it really does necessitate that everyone re-examines address plans.</p>\n",
