The whole promise of answering &quot;/64&quot; to every &quot;how big should this segment be?&quot; question now goes out the window.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re running a sizable campus network and you assume the worst-case (every device is an android device), then we&#39;re back to playing &quot;right sizing&quot; games just with prefixes instead of addresses. Or you can just pretend that IPv6 addresses only has 64 bits and then re-adopt IPv4 thinking.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at an example -- In your address plan, if you had assigned a /48 to each building and used 8 bits for &quot;function&quot; and 8 bits for an instance (in case you needed multiple VLANs to deal with broadcast domain size), then you can really only assume 250 devices for android in any given function, which isn&#39;t a lot.</p>\n\n<p>Now realistically, most big networks I know of tunnel wireless traffic to a central controller cluster, which helps if had a big &#39;ol &quot;reserved for future use&quot; in the top level of your address plan that you can devote to Android.</p>\n\n<p>My ranting aside, it really does necessitate that everyone re-examines address plans.</p>\n",

To me, this makes as much sense as my usual quip that copy-paste makes rockets explode, but maybe I&rsquo;m missing something.</p>\n\n<p>This part is true, Ivan. Dating back to 2013 (or as early as 2011 IIRC, it&#39;s been a decade+ since I read it), there was a paper Cisco published (I can&#39;t find it now, but you may have better Google fu skills than me) that demonstrated/studied how CGNAT/NAT = battery expense due to NAT keep-alive traffic.</p>\n\n<p>I think rfc6269 and rfc6887 also talked about batteries.</p>\n\n<p>The apps running on the host keeps sending those packets every X seconds, which means a lot on mobile devices&#39; battery runtime. Keep in mind, the mobile phone can have like 200 apps, and maybe 20-50 do &ldquo;light&rdquo; background NAT keep-alive every X second. VoWiFi alone in my testing sends keep-alive every 5&ndash;10 seconds &mdash; this is insane.</p>\n\n<p>Anecdotally, I&#39;ve run a lot of &ldquo;tests&rdquo; in my home lab (I have physical transit, public routed v4/v6 blocks, no NAT aka NAT-only for testing) over the past 4&ndash;5 years. Go to sleep with iPhone at 100% battery (verified by CoconutBattery), wake up to 10% drain with NAT (no IPv6) vs wake up to 1-2% or 0% drain with NAT+native IPv6 or native IPv4+native IPv6.</p>\n\n<p>The &ldquo;fair&rdquo; compromise I found that worked best for real-world networking:\n1. IPv4 CGNAT/NAT with EIM-EIF (hairpin too, because TURN).\n2. Native IPv6.\n3. Move on with life.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, I&#39;m obsessed with battery life on mobile computing devices, off-topic, but I recommend every tech person to read everything here:\nhttps://batteryuniversity.com/</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t quote me on this one, just what I&#39;ve heard/seen: Regarding LTE/5G, I believe the general practice is a /64 link-prefix per PDP/PDU(I think this is 5G terminology) context/session, the UE then generates /128s using SLAAC. However, some Telcos may already be doing /64 ia_pd for a long time.</p>\n\n<p>Few folks in the consulting world have advocated for /63 ia_pd per UE in LTE/5G for a long-time, some I heard deployed this successfully in the past, but there&#39;s no public-facing docs or presentations/talks about this as far as I know.</p>\n\n<p>But I recently had a chance to talk to an MVNO, and I asked about IPv6, turns out 3GPP world is a mess and not every EPC software maker implemented IPv6 specs the same way, so in this instance, the IPv6 UE Pool &mdash; nobody knows what it means ia_na? ia_pd? SLAAC? Something magical? No idea &#x1F937;&zwj;&#x2642;&#xFE0F;\nI just advised them on future proofing the subnet plan and moved on with my life, don&#39;t have bandwidth to learn that world of networking.</p>\n",

               "html": "<p>&gt; How many realistic scenarios have you seen where a phone connected to a WiFi would offer a tethered IPv6 connection to... what? Over what?</p>\n\n<p>They don&#39;t do this now...at least android doesn&#39;t much to my disappointment. They SHOULD offer it and currently do not. I think it&#39;s because for SLAAC this requires an NDP proxy and technically the way this works on cellular is different from that but I&#39;m guessing.</p>\n\n<p>&gt; There&#39;s a reason my Apple Watch has a WiFi interface -- I can use it even when I&#39;m in another room than my phone.</p>\n\n<p>Why are you focused on smart watches? Those typically use a different system from tethering, at least on android. In fact my smart watch does some weird voodoo proxy non-sense and doesn&#39;t even count as a tether. I&#39;m mainly focusing on connecting devices to a phone and then using the phone as a sort of WiFi proxy. For example connecting my laptop to my phone while my phone is on WiFi.</p>\n\n<p>&gt; If you use different client identifiers for tethered devices, you&#39;ll get multiple addresses, right?</p>\n\n<p>Interesting point, what if they configure a policy such that each mac address can only have a single address? The reason I propose that is because if their goal is to restrict devices to 1 address then it becomes trivial to just use multiple DUIDs to bypass that restriction so it&#39;s not a very good way of enforcing that policy.</p>\n\n<p>&gt; You say policy, I say crusade ;) No other major vendor has a problem with running a DHCPv6 client using IA_NA on their IPv6 hosts.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear I&#39;m not entirely in support of android&#39;s &quot;crusade&quot; but I do see some concerns with DHCPv6. It&#39;s not that there&#39;s a problem with using IA_NA, it&#39;s more that it opens the door to less than ideal v6 deployments from a users perspective. With v4 (because of NAT) I can tether from my phone to other devices, I can&#39;t do that with v6 IA_NA if the network restricts addressing to 1 per device (or 2 for 464XLAT). The same goes for running virtual machines on a laptop which can be done with v4 NAT or with v6 using an NDP proxy with SLAAC. Basically I guess, TL;DR: I&#39;m not against DHCP IA_NA, I&#39;m against anything that has the potential to force people into using v6 NAT because NAT is the one thing I will crusade against.</p>\n\n<p>Aside about my smart watch because I find it interesting:\nI have a moto 360 android wear smartwatch. It assigns itself an IPv4 address to a Linux ifb interface. The watch does not get an IPv6 address at all even when on cellular. I don&#39;t know exactly how it works but there is no corresponding tether interface on the phone and the watch cannot emit ICMP. My assumption is it seems to be some form of userspace proxy to the android wearOS app. It&#39;s not using bluetooth tethering as that can be disabled while the watch still has internet and bluetooth tethering creates a pan interface with dual stack addressing that the watch doesn&#39;t need or use. I suppose I should do a bit more digging to try to understand what&#39;s going on as it&#39;s a really odd setup. This whole fiasco has been a nuisance for my personal network since the watch doesn&#39;t support WPA3 and my network is WPA3 only and v6 only so my watch has no internet at home. The bleeding edge is...sharp and bloody lol.</p>\n",
