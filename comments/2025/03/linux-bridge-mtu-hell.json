Which also means that, contrary to my previous belief, a packet bigger than the MTU on an ingress port will not cause a packet too big message to be sent back. Which means trouble when the egress interface can not reach the sender of the packet. But that&#39;s only a theoretical scenario, right? Right...</p>\n",
