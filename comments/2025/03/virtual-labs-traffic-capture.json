Edgeshark is an open source project by Siemens, it provides a web interface for most networking constructs found on your lab machine, allowing you to select them, start a capture, then pipe that to a local Wireshark installation. It&rsquo;s easy to use, just grab a compose file and run it. There&rsquo;s some required plumbing to perform beforehand, the whole process is documented pretty good in the Containerlab manual: https://containerlab.dev/manual/wireshark/</p>\n",
