            <div class="comment-content"><p>great bit! I just had great fun discovering that MTU is apparently only applied on egress?! Which also means that, contrary to my previous belief, a packet bigger than the MTU on an ingress port will not cause a packet too big message to be sent back. Which means trouble when the egress interface can not reach the sender of the packet. But that&#39;s only a theoretical scenario, right? Right...</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Technically, a packet too big on ingress should be dropped (as it could not fit into the input buffer), but of course, that&#39;s not how Linux bridges work; they are just shuffling pointers to packet buffers.</p>

<p>Anyway, the bridge SHOULD NOT send the PTB message anyway (or mess with the packets), and in my case, it COULD NOT because it had no IP address.</p>

<p>Finally, there&#39;s nothing the egress interface could do -- it never saw the packet anyway.</p>
