            <div class="comment-content"><p>&gt; It&rsquo;s also worth noting that most residential customers didn&rsquo;t care at all about those technical details</p>

<p>They don&#39;t care about engineering, but they sure do create support tickets about broken P2P applications, such as Xbox/PS gaming applications, broken VoIP in gaming lobbies, failure of SIP client to punch through etc. All these problems don&#39;t exist on native routed (and static) IPv6.</p>

<p>In order for P2P to work as close as possible to routed IPv6 in NATted IPv4, we had to deploy a bunch of workarounds such as EIM-NAT to allow TCP/UDP P2P punching to work both ways, we had to allow hairpinning on the CGNAT device to allow intra-CGNAT traffic to work between to CGNAT clients, as TURN can only detect the public-facing IP:Port, hairpinning allow 100.64.0.0/10 clients to talk to each other over the CGNATted public IP:Port.</p>

<p>All this complexity, because NAT <em>is</em> evil, and even if argued otherwise, the end-result is, it leads to centralisation of content/traffic on a few hyperscale organisations &mdash; how&#39;s this doing favour for the future of humanity, free speech et al.? I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Wrong. Every decent home router is also a one-way stateful firewall. You just replaced NAT hole punching with firewall hole punching.</p>

<p>&gt; the end-result is, it leads to centralisation of content/traffic on a few hyperscale organisations</p>

<p>Wrong. The centralization of content is a side effect of our laziness (a topic for another blog post ;)</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>&gt; Wrong. Every decent home router is also a one-way stateful firewall. You just replaced NAT hole punching with firewall hole punching.</p>

<p>Not sure what&#39;s &#39;wrong&#39; here:
1. Firewall hole punching only involves STUN, and that&#39;s it. We move on with our lives.
2. NAT hole punching in the absence of EIM-NAT+Hairpinning (aka 99% of ISPs) breaks P2P, resorting to TURN-relaying, and this is what creates customer support tickets.
3. Whereas with firewalled IPv6, once STUN does its job, there&#39;s no customer support tickets, because P2P will just work.</p>

<p>Most popular end-user software applications these days, are coded with STUN libraries from day one anyway, a developer doesn&#39;t need to be a software network engineer to be able to call upon some GitHub popular entries for STUN. It&#39;s crazy how ubiquitous STUN has become in our daily lives, yet invisible to most people, unless they PCAP their home and office networks.</p>

<p>I myself use stateful firewall in my own home network as well (with PIA IPv6 space), I can confirm with PCAPs, that P2P software such as BitTorrent (nothing wrong with seeding Debian torrents!), VoIP etc, successfully establish P2P over STUN, no TURN involvement. It is true P2P, where src and dst /128 IPs belongs to each endpoint objectively.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to say is:
The goal of modern-day IPv6 should be to get rid of TURN, ensuring P2P can work either natively (rare) or with STUN-assist (99% of the time), in either case, it&#39;s P2P and not TURN-relayed.</p>

<p>What CAN be a blog post topic (that I myself may write about in the future) is, basic IPv6 firewall guidelines and logic to preserve SOLICITED (very important keyword) P2P connectivity.</p>

<p>&gt; Wrong. The centralization of content is a side effect of our laziness (a topic for another blog post ;)</p>

<p>Well, NAT is laziness (because who wants IPv6), and it goes hand-in-hand. This is less of a technical topic and more of a subjective layer 8 topic, that I&#39;m sure, will be a never ending debate :)</p>
