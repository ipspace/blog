            <div class="comment-content"><p>&gt; It&rsquo;s also worth noting that most residential customers didn&rsquo;t care at all about those technical details</p>

<p>They don&#39;t care about engineering, but they sure do create support tickets about broken P2P applications, such as Xbox/PS gaming applications, broken VoIP in gaming lobbies, failure of SIP client to punch through etc. All these problems don&#39;t exist on native routed (and static) IPv6.</p>

<p>In order for P2P to work as close as possible to routed IPv6 in NATted IPv4, we had to deploy a bunch of workarounds such as EIM-NAT to allow TCP/UDP P2P punching to work both ways, we had to allow hairpinning on the CGNAT device to allow intra-CGNAT traffic to work between to CGNAT clients, as TURN can only detect the public-facing IP:Port, hairpinning allow 100.64.0.0/10 clients to talk to each other over the CGNATted public IP:Port.</p>

<p>All this complexity, because NAT <em>is</em> evil, and even if argued otherwise, the end-result is, it leads to centralisation of content/traffic on a few hyperscale organisations &mdash; how&#39;s this doing favour for the future of humanity, free speech et al.? I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Wrong. Every decent home router is also a one-way stateful firewall. You just replaced NAT hole punching with firewall hole punching.</p>

<p>&gt; the end-result is, it leads to centralisation of content/traffic on a few hyperscale organisations</p>

<p>Wrong. The centralization of content is a side effect of our laziness (a topic for another blog post ;)</p>
