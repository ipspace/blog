               "html": "<p>&gt; Wrong. Every decent home router is also a one-way stateful firewall. You just replaced NAT hole punching with firewall hole punching.</p>\n\n<p>Not sure what&#39;s &#39;wrong&#39; here:\n1. Firewall hole punching only involves STUN, and that&#39;s it. We move on with our lives.\n2. NAT hole punching in the absence of EIM-NAT+Hairpinning (aka 99% of ISPs) breaks P2P, resorting to TURN-relaying, and this is what creates customer support tickets.\n3. Whereas with firewalled IPv6, once STUN does its job, there&#39;s no customer support tickets, because P2P will just work.</p>\n\n<p>Most popular end-user software applications these days, are coded with STUN libraries from day one anyway, a developer doesn&#39;t need to be a software network engineer to be able to call upon some GitHub popular entries for STUN. It&#39;s crazy how ubiquitous STUN has become in our daily lives, yet invisible to most people, unless they PCAP their home and office networks.</p>\n\n<p>I myself use stateful firewall in my own home network as well (with PIA IPv6 space), I can confirm with PCAPs, that P2P software such as BitTorrent (nothing wrong with seeding Debian torrents!), VoIP etc, successfully establish P2P over STUN, no TURN involvement. It is true P2P, where src and dst /128 IPs belongs to each endpoint objectively.</p>\n\n<p>What I&#39;m trying to say is:\nThe goal of modern-day IPv6 should be to get rid of TURN, ensuring P2P can work either natively (rare) or with STUN-assist (99% of the time), in either case, it&#39;s P2P and not TURN-relayed.</p>\n\n<p>What CAN be a blog post topic (that I myself may write about in the future) is, basic IPv6 firewall guidelines and logic to preserve SOLICITED (very important keyword) P2P connectivity.</p>\n\n<p>&gt; Wrong. The centralization of content is a side effect of our laziness (a topic for another blog post ;)</p>\n\n<p>Well, NAT is laziness (because who wants IPv6), and it goes hand-in-hand. This is less of a technical topic and more of a subjective layer 8 topic, that I&#39;m sure, will be a never ending debate :)</p>\n",
