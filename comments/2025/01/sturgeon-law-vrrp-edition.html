            <div class="comment-content"><p>Very interesting!</p>

<p>It&#39;s surprising that the initial VRRPv3 RFC 5798 refers to the IPv6 RFC to define the pseudo-header calculation, leaving the behavior with IPv4 undefined. </p>

<p>If I understand correctly, the original IP specification does not define a pseudo-header, but it is defined in transport protocols (TCP and UDP both include the same exact definition for the pseudo-header fields) in order to calculate a valid checksum that does not depend on varying IPv4 fields such as TTL. Since IPv6 is defined after TCP and UDP, they had to include the pseudo-header calculation mechanism in the RFC for TCP and UDP use.</p>

<p>However, to me it&#39;s more surprising that when they identified the VRRPv3 ambiguity and clarified it in RFC 9568, they didn&#39;t refer to the pseudo-header definition in RFCs 793/768 (TCP/UDP) but instead preferred to avoid using any field from IPv4. I mean: if the pseudo-header is useful (since it was employed it in the first case), why not using it in IPv4? I suppose that compatibility with existing deployments was more relevant than functionality. </p>
