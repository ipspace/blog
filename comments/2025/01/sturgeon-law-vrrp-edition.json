Since IPv6 is defined after TCP and UDP, they had to include the pseudo-header calculation mechanism in the RFC for TCP and UDP use.</p>\n\n<p>However, to me it&#39;s more surprising that when they identified the VRRPv3 ambiguity and clarified it in RFC 9568, they didn&#39;t refer to the pseudo-header definition in RFCs 793/768 (TCP/UDP) but instead preferred to avoid using any field from IPv4. I mean: if the pseudo-header is useful (since it was employed it in the first case), why not using it in IPv4? I suppose that compatibility with existing deployments was more relevant than functionality. </p>\n",
