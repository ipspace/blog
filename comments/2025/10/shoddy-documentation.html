            <div class="comment-content"><p>A few reasons to name, perhaps, biased as well:</p>

<p>&bull; Vendors and partners: &quot;If the documentation is too good, we sell less tech support subscriptions and professional services..&quot;
&bull; Training business: &quot;If the courses are too good, people attend once and then share the knowledge horizontally..&quot;
&bull; Customer tech gurus: &quot;If the documentation and trainings are too good, my junior staff understands my awkward designs and configurations, can optimize them and threatens me out of my guru chair..&quot;
&bull; General public: &quot;We do not care, just give us a quick recipe that works to copy and paste..&quot; </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>While a well-known author of a particularly obtuse RFC supposedly said, &quot;It&#39;s not my job to educate the competition,&quot; I&#39;m an optimist, hoping the above reasons (although all very much present) are still a minority view and that Hanlon&#39;s Razor applies to this case as well.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>The way I see it, there are two main factors contributing to the decrease in quality for the documentation :
- speed of change ; the change process is continuously accelerating (&quot;new&quot; features mostly) and people need to compromise on the details covered in the documentation, otherwise can&#39;t keep up with updating it
- abstraction ; the underlying technologies (what is under the hood, how it works, etc.) are no longer interesting to the audience, as everyone wants an easy way of achieving something (if possible with a few clicks of a mouse)</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>While I agree with the &quot;underlying technologies are no longer interesting to the wide audience&quot;, we&#39;re experiencing the same shift everywhere in IT, and yet Python or MariaDB (for example) still have pretty good documentation ;)</p>

<p>As for &quot;speed of change,&quot; -- while it might be true in IT in general, I don&#39;t think it applies to networking, be it in the physical or virtual (VM or containers) world. </p>

<p>Just one data point (and I know that anecdotes != data), the VMware NSX documentation got worse and worse as the speed of change (= new features per release) decreased, which could imply the &quot;we captured the addressable market, now it&#39;s time to cut costs&quot; mentality.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Great documentation requires investment from the supplier,both Financial and personnel/ resource investment. This costs money and personnel resources are incredibly precious. Thus, the equation suppliers look at is what is the incremental revenue increase of producing great (versus mediocre) documentation and where else could I apply those precious resources (to new products or selling to big customers). Sadly, it is a financial decision and the numbers don&rsquo;t clearly show the ROI. As a former engineer I can attest to the value of great documentation but right now feature velocity is prioritized. The good news is that if a supplier who produces great documentation starts winning in the market, others will follow. So vote with your dollars, include it in RFP selection criteria, and eliminate vendors with poor documentation from your shortlists&hellip;</p>
