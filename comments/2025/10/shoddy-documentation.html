            <div class="comment-content"><p>A few reasons to name, perhaps, biased as well:</p>

<p>&bull; Vendors and partners: &quot;If the documentation is too good, we sell less tech support subscriptions and professional services..&quot;
&bull; Training business: &quot;If the courses are too good, people attend once and then share the knowledge horizontally..&quot;
&bull; Customer tech gurus: &quot;If the documentation and trainings are too good, my junior staff understands my awkward designs and configurations, can optimize them and threatens me out of my guru chair..&quot;
&bull; General public: &quot;We do not care, just give us a quick recipe that works to copy and paste..&quot; </p>
