            <div class="comment-content"><p>A few reasons to name, perhaps, biased as well:</p>

<p>&bull; Vendors and partners: &quot;If the documentation is too good, we sell less tech support subscriptions and professional services..&quot;
&bull; Training business: &quot;If the courses are too good, people attend once and then share the knowledge horizontally..&quot;
&bull; Customer tech gurus: &quot;If the documentation and trainings are too good, my junior staff understands my awkward designs and configurations, can optimize them and threatens me out of my guru chair..&quot;
&bull; General public: &quot;We do not care, just give us a quick recipe that works to copy and paste..&quot; </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>While a well-known author of a particularly obtuse RFC supposedly said, &quot;It&#39;s not my job to educate the competition,&quot; I&#39;m an optimist, hoping the above reasons (although all very much present) are still a minority view and that Hanlon&#39;s Razor applies to this case as well.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>The way I see it, there are two main factors contributing to the decrease in quality for the documentation :
- speed of change ; the change process is continuously accelerating (&quot;new&quot; features mostly) and people need to compromise on the details covered in the documentation, otherwise can&#39;t keep up with updating it
- abstraction ; the underlying technologies (what is under the hood, how it works, etc.) are no longer interesting to the audience, as everyone wants an easy way of achieving something (if possible with a few clicks of a mouse)</p>
