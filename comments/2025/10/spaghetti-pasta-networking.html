            <div class="comment-content"><p>This type of userland networking was the last straw that ultimately drove me away from Linux containers. I tried to love Podman, their general approach and also their ability to run rootless containers are pretty cool. Sadly it leads to these kinds of clutches. It&#39;s all detailed nicely in the book Podman in Action by Daniel Walsh. I guess most of the world doesn&#39;t have the userland networking problem because they just run containers as root.</p>
