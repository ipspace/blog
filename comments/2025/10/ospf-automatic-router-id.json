I&rsquo;ll make sure the IOS-XE documentation team not only fixes this but also other issues in that document that are clearly below the standard we should strive for.   </p>\n\n<p>As a side note, I&rsquo;d love to see you again at one of the upcoming PLNOG conferences. We&rsquo;ve met a couple of times long, long ago - including that time in Krakow when even Greg Ferro himself decided to come down to Poland to visit NOG :)</p>\n\n<p>Best regards to You and Dear Readers!</p>\n",
