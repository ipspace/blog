<p>When I started in 2002 my old boss told me to <em>always</em> hard code the router-id.  You never know when the config of an interface, even a loopback, could be changed or deleted.</p>

<p>Later, I was playing around in the lab and realized you could use 0.0.0.x on Cisco gear for your router-ids.  It worked great!  When you issue commands like show ip ospf database the router-ids stick out like a road flare.  They look distinctly different from IPv4 addresses.</p>

<p>When I tried doing that on Procurve, no luck!  0.0.0.0/8 was unavailable for router-ids.  OK.  On that gear I used 1.0.0.x.  Nobody uses 1.0.0.0/8... until CloudFlare cleaned it up and started using it.  That&#39;s another interesting story.  Cloudflare has great blogs explaining the engineering in their products.</p>

<p>I have no idea if you can use 0.x.x.x on Juniper or any other vendor.  If someone knows, drop a comment.</p>
