I&#39;m not sure calling it a failure works globally, see India. It also doesn&#39;t really address the scalability issues with IPv4. Yes we could keep working on the protocol and extending it to make it scale better, but there are so few addresses and all of them have already been assigned. I just don&#39;t see how there is any practical or viable way to keep pushing IPv4 forward.</p>\n",
