In 2010 (30 years from the introduction of the IPv4 spec) the total internet(IPv4) adoption in the developed world was just 67%. Yes 50% 30 years after the introduction of the IPv6 spec is lagging behind(and ironically the developing world is ahead) but it&#39;s also not a big enough gap to be called a failure when you compare it to how long the Internet itself took to gain mass adoption. It&#39;s moving slower than IPv4 did but that&#39;s to be expected. IPv4(the Internet) was a revolutionary technology and IPv6 is something only the network professionals care about. Maybe my logic here is flawed but from this lense it just doesn&#39;t seem like a failure, just par for the course really. I do wish it would hurry up though lol.</p>\n",

I&#39;m not sure calling it a failure works globally, see India. It also doesn&#39;t really address the scalability issues with IPv4. Yes we could keep working on the protocol and extending it to make it scale better, but there are so few addresses and all of them have already been assigned. I just don&#39;t see how there is any practical or viable way to keep pushing IPv4 forward.</p>\n",
