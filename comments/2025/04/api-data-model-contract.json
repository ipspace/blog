Being able to <code>get-config</code> a full XML configuration from version N and <code>edit-config</code> it to version N+1 would be a bless (and the router is well able to do it during the upgrade process...). You actually <em>can</em> include the YANG version in your request, by embeeding it to the xmlns model of your XML payload (never done that though).\nI also think that YANG/NETCONF underestimated the importance of dealing with versioning. gRPC/protobufs do it better. Like, including changelogs inside the YANG file in the age of git?? Come on. Even back in 2010 (first YANG RFC, 6020), versioning tools were all over the place (maybe not at the IETF though).\nPS: here is a freely available web tool developed by Nokia to help you list the YANG changes between versions : https://yang.labctl.net/yang/SROS/.\nCheers.</p>\n",
