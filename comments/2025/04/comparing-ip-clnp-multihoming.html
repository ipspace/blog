            <div class="comment-content">We have a generic site multi-homing solution: the LISP protocol. Now it is a full Internet proposed standard. I know it is not popular besides Cisco, but from the technology perspective it is a quite good solution.<br />

<p>As a plus benefit, you get a true multilink mobility support without any additional stuff. Even PMIPv6 cannot do that kind of mobility, since it is only good for single link mobility. </p>

<p>And then you can combine mutlink mobility with site multihoming. Perfect solution for safety critical and mission critical networks. </p>
