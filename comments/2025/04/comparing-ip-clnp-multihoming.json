         "html": "We have a generic site multi-homing solution: the LISP protocol. Now it is a full Internet proposed standard. I know it is not popular besides Cisco, but from the technology perspective it is a quite good solution.<br />\n\n<p>As a plus benefit, you get a true multilink mobility support without any additional stuff. Even PMIPv6 cannot do that kind of mobility, since it is only good for single link mobility. </p>\n\n<p>And then you can combine mutlink mobility with site multihoming. Perfect solution for safety critical and mission critical networks. </p>\n",
