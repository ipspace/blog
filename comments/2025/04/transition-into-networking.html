            <div class="comment-content"><p>That&#39;s all fine, but it looks like an advice to the person that aims at working in 500 top companies. Average enterprise? Skip the automation, CCNP is fine, add Azure and AWS cert too and You&#39;re really ok. Probably some firewall vendor cert would also benefit, but in terms of knowledge they&#39;re like forklift permission, not more.
Too cynical, maybe, but not much.</p>
