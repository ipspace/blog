            <div class="comment-content"><p>Can confirm chatGPT 4o is pretty impressive most of the time when you ask it the more &#39;general&#39; configuration type questions. As your answer from it goes it had probably seen many many instances of the question asked and so its statistical model was able to provide a sane and mostly correct answer.</p>

<p>Anytime you get towards what is likely more corner cases beware the LLM answers.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I&#39;ve been extremely impressed with ChatGPT&#39;s ability to translate natural language queries into real, meaningful output, but generally less impressed by the confidence with which it gives completely wrong answers for many networking-related topics.</p>

<p>I asked it the other day to create a basic configuration for terminating a DIA circuit on a Cisco ISR 4331, and while it got it 90% correct, the remaining 10% would&#39;ve left you locked out of the router without traffic being passed. I could see MSPs especially struggling with customers trying to save money by using ChatGPT instead.</p>
