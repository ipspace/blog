Rather, it simply adds the cost of the route to the ABR and the cost included in the LSA. A route to the advertised destination, via the ABR, is entered into the route table along with the calculated cost. This behavior&mdash;depending on an intermediate router instead of determining the full route to the destination&mdash;is distance vector behavior. So, while OSPF is a link state protocol within an area, it uses a distance vector algorithm to find inter-area routes.&quot;</p>\n",
