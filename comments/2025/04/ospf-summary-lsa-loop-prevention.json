         "html": "<p>Excerpt from the old Doyle classic </p>\n\n<p>&quot;When another router receives a Network Summary LSA from an ABR, it does not run the SPF algorithm. Rather, it simply adds the cost of the route to the ABR and the cost included in the LSA. A route to the advertised destination, via the ABR, is entered into the route table along with the calculated cost. This behavior&mdash;depending on an intermediate router instead of determining the full route to the destination&mdash;is distance vector behavior. So, while OSPF is a link state protocol within an area, it uses a distance vector algorithm to find inter-area routes.&quot;</p>\n",
