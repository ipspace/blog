            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hello Ivan. IBN is different from SDN. While SDN encompasses a lot of acronyms and ideas about network management that revolve around a centralized and software-based controller, IBN is simply about building a system that allows network operators/engineers and other systems to express requirements in a declarative and desired-state way rather than in an imperative way. I think they are very different ideas, although SDN systems can use IBN e.g. as a paradigm for their north-bound interface.</p>

<p>Regarding source-based traffic steering and associated signaling, I agree that an application listing desired nodes/segments to traverse seems impractical. However, combining Segment Routing (either using MPLS or IPv6) and &quot;flexible algorithm&quot; (rfc9350) seems more realitsic: 1/ IGPs implement multiple topologies based on different metrics (link delay, number of hops, etc.), using new TLVs in a distributed way, 2/ network engineers associate numbering rules associated with these different metrics, 3/ applications use these numbering rules to indicate their requirements. These are quite new technologies so I cannot reference any real-world large scale end-to-end and time-tested implementation, but that&#39;s the idea :-)</p>

<p>Peace</p>
