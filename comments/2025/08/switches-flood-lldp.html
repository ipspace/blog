            <div class="comment-content"><p>I recall something similar happening with Arista switches at some point, not with LLDP but one of the other slow protocols (can&#39;t remember which one).</p>

<p>Without going into standards (nobody reads them anyway), the way it&#39;s usually implemented in a switch is that there is a ACL with a list of special MAC addresses that the switch should capture for further processing and not just flood. If the special MAC address for a given protocol is not on this list, it&#39;s treated as a regular Ethernet frame, i.e. flooded.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>But what if this switch does not claim compliance to MEF 45.1?</p>

<p>Service providers might manage a CE L2 device in a way that it should be invisible to the customer. Then of course LLDP flooding looks logical. 
Topology hiding is a basic requirement for service provider networks. It could be applied to L2 services, too. </p>

<p>If the customer manages the CE, then normally it would not happen. </p>

<p>It all depends on your concept of how you define your WAN services.</p>

<p>The main issue is thinking in ISO reference model terms. You should think in G.805/G.809 terms when you cover service provider networks. Then it is easy to understand why LLDP flooding might be the preferred way...</p>
