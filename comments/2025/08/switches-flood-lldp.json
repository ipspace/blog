If the special MAC address for a given protocol is not on this list, it&#39;s treated as a regular Ethernet frame, i.e. flooded.</p>\n",

Then of course LLDP flooding looks logical. \nTopology hiding is a basic requirement for service provider networks. It could be applied to L2 services, too. </p>\n\n<p>If the customer manages the CE, then normally it would not happen. </p>\n\n<p>It all depends on your concept of how you define your WAN services.</p>\n\n<p>The main issue is thinking in ISO reference model terms. You should think in G.805/G.809 terms when you cover service provider networks. Then it is easy to understand why LLDP flooding might be the preferred way...</p>\n",
