            <div class="comment-content"><p>I&#39;ve always used &quot;send-community both&quot; and, if I&#39;m not mistaken, this gets add to the config as that way.
I cannot remember that I&#39;ve ever seen &quot;send-community standard&quot; <em>and</em> &quot;send-community extended&quot; in any config. To me, it was always XOR &quot;both&quot; for both or &quot;standard&quot; / &quot;extended&quot; for one or the other only.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I verified this on actual hardware on 17.18.01.  Previous versions consolidate the two lines into one with the &quot;both&quot; keyword at the end.  Now the commands override each other.  If you enter standard first and then extended, extended is all you get.  If you go the other way, standard will override extended.  (Interestingly enough, even if you enter the &quot;standard&quot; keyword, it shows up in the config simply as &quot;neighbor x.x.x.x send-community&quot;.  I&#39;m not a huge fan of re-working the user-input syntax, but these commands are as old as time.)  You can still enter &quot;neighbor x.x.x.x send-community both&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why we changed this.  I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s worked this way for as long as I&#39;ve been configuring BGP, and that&#39;s a long time.  I&#39;ll see if I can find anything out.</p>
