I was waiting for this comment, and you didn&#39;t disappoint.</p>\n\n<p>You might want to do a bit of research on GitHub before telling me that &quot;open source is not free&quot;, or is that too much of a bother?</p>\n\n<p>Also, I did open an issue with Ansible a long while ago, and even submitted a pull request. After going through the pains of pushing that PR through, I decided to invest my time in other open-source projects.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, as we all know, Ansible is not just any open-source project, and I have a bit higher bar for a project mostly funded by an IT behemoth than for something single-handedly maintained by a random person in Nebraska since 2003.</p>\n",

To be honest, this did concern me as well, and I wondered why the Ansible Network community using the project version wasn&rsquo;t engaging more with the broader Ansible community on the official forums.</p>\n\n<p>The Ansible core team did reach out to the community through a forum post\nhttps://forum.ansible.com/t/core-2-19-templating-changes-preview-and-testing/40759\nto gather feedback on the pre-release version of ansible-core 2.19.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any thoughts or suggestions on how the Ansible community can improve communication and feedback loops, we&rsquo;d really appreciate you sharing them.</p>\n",
