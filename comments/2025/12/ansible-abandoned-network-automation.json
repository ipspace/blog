I was waiting for this comment, and you didn&#39;t disappoint.</p>\n\n<p>You might want to do a bit of research on GitHub before telling me that &quot;open source is not free&quot;, or is that too much of a bother?</p>\n\n<p>Also, I did open an issue with Ansible a long while ago, and even submitted a pull request. After going through the pains of pushing that PR through, I decided to invest my time in other open-source projects.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, as we all know, Ansible is not just any open-source project, and I have a bit higher bar for a project mostly funded by an IT behemoth than for something single-handedly maintained by a random person in Nebraska since 2003.</p>\n",
