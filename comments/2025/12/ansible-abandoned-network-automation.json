I think there might be several... </p>\n\n<p>One of the issues is the rather odd release method of Ansible. There&#39;s Ansible Community, and Ansible Core. Ansible Core (2.19) is what broke almost every network module in existence, primarily through netcommon, but there was other broken modules, like Arista AVD. </p>\n\n<p>That preceded Ansible Community 12, so there was a time when even though 2.19 was broken, Community 11 which was still the current community release used 2.18. </p>\n\n<p>The difference? Mostly it was &quot;pip3 install ansible&quot; versus &quot;pip3 install ansible-core&quot;. The former is what most people tended to use, so they were spared the breakage. </p>\n\n<p>To the Ansible projects credit, the issue was finally addressed and Community 12 was delayed for a while (a month or so IIRC) until some fixes to netcommon were put in place. This... mostly... fixed the issues. </p>\n\n<p>But what a wild ride it was, and easily avoidable. </p>\n",

Collections, modules, and plugins evolve independently and often at different speeds, driven by vendors and individual maintainers. If you track the latest community releases, you are intentionally opting into that velocity, which can result in churn and occasional breakage.</p>\n\n<p>Ansible Automation Platform is intentionally different. It is a curated, enterprise product with a fixed and fully tested set of collections, long support lifecycles, backward compatibility guarantees within a major release, and a clear deprecation and migration process. Most customers pin to a specific AAP release and do not consume upstream changes unless they explicitly choose to.</p>\n\n<p>This is also why the bug being discussed did not actually affect the product. It only existed in the upstream community project. The issue appeared in Ansible Core 2.19, which is newer than what we currently ship to customers in Ansible Automation Platform. Because customers were not yet exposed to that version, it did not surface through normal product usage and was something we missed upstream before it was discovered.</p>\n\n<p>That distinction matters. This is not a case of the product breaking production networks. It is an example of upstream moving faster than the supported platform, which is exactly why the product exists in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>On the broader point about relearning tools, I agree that production networks cannot operate on a move fast and break things model. Ansible Automation Platform is explicitly designed to avoid that philosophy. It exists to let network teams focus on building and operating stable networks while innovation continues upstream at a pace that does not disrupt production environments.</p>\n",
