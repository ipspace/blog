I think the later is more viable. </p>\n\n<p>I also think the various vendors (Arista, Cisco) should take over these projects. Arista has AVD and they do quite a bit with theirs. Juniper just took their modules over IIRC. </p>\n\n<p>With Arista, eos_configs works well though it doesn&#39;t have commit confirm, which would be really really great to have. </p>\n",
