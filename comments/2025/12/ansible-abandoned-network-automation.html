            <div class="comment-content"><p>Awesome!!! I was waiting for this comment, and you didn&#39;t disappoint.</p>

<p>You might want to do a bit of research on GitHub before telling me that &quot;open source is not free&quot;, or is that too much of a bother?</p>

<p>Also, I did open an issue with Ansible a long while ago, and even submitted a pull request. After going through the pains of pushing that PR through, I decided to invest my time in other open-source projects.</p>

<p>Finally, as we all know, Ansible is not just any open-source project, and I have a bit higher bar for a project mostly funded by an IT behemoth than for something single-handedly maintained by a random person in Nebraska since 2003.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Ansible engineer here. This blog was recently brought to my attention.</p>

<p>The Ansible team continues to maintain, develop and enhance Ansible Network Automation. The Ansible Project Release 12, which uses ansible-core 2.19, introduced significant changes to the templating engine due to the new data tagging feature. It is most likely that you are encountering this issue because of those changes.</p>

<p>References:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ansible/comments/1k7n33q/preparing_your_playbooks_for_core219/</p>

<p>The latest product version, Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) 2.6, is based on ansible-core 2.16:</p>

<p>https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.6/html-single/release_notes/index</p>

<p>This is the reason users who are running ansible-core versions pinned to the product release have not encountered this issue.</p>

<p>That said, it would have been very helpful for the Ansible Network team to triage and prioritize fixing these issues if they had been raised in the relevant GitHub repositories.</p>
