<p>You might want to do a bit of research on GitHub before telling me that &quot;open source is not free&quot;, or is that too much of a bother?</p>

<p>Also, I did open an issue with Ansible a long while ago, and even submitted a pull request. After going through the pains of pushing that PR through, I decided to invest my time in other open-source projects.</p>

<p>Finally, as we all know, Ansible is not just any open-source project, and I have a bit higher bar for a project mostly funded by an IT behemoth than for something single-handedly maintained by a random person in Nebraska since 2003.</p>

<p>The Ansible team continues to maintain, develop and enhance Ansible Network Automation. The Ansible Project Release 12, which uses ansible-core 2.19, introduced significant changes to the templating engine due to the new data tagging feature. It is most likely that you are encountering this issue because of those changes.</p>

https://www.reddit.com/r/ansible/comments/1k7n33q/preparing_your_playbooks_for_core219/</p>

<p>The latest product version, Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) 2.6, is based on ansible-core 2.16:</p>

<p>https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.6/html-single/release_notes/index</p>

<p>This is the reason users who are running ansible-core versions pinned to the product release have not encountered this issue.</p>

<p>That said, it would have been very helpful for the Ansible Network team to triage and prioritize fixing these issues if they had been raised in the relevant GitHub repositories.</p>

<p>&gt; The latest product version, Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) 2.6, is based on ansible-core 2.16</p>

<p>That&#39;s a very useful hint. I might pin my Ansible installations to the ansible-core version used by AAP and change that once AAP moves forward.</p>

<p>&gt; It would have been very helpful for the Ansible Network team to triage and prioritize fixing these issues if they had been raised in the relevant GitHub repositories</p>

<p>I completely agree, and if I were on the other side, I would be slightly worried that nobody did that, unless nobody is doing configuration templating any longer, in which case life&#39;s good.</p>

<p>I think there are two ways to use the various Ansible modules: Either use all the discreet modules (VLANS, OSPF, BGP, etc.) or use only command and config, the later to &quot;Genesis Torpedo&quot; replace the config built from a template. I think the later is more viable. </p>

<p>I also think the various vendors (Arista, Cisco) should take over these projects. Arista has AVD and they do quite a bit with theirs. Juniper just took their modules over IIRC. </p>

<p>With Arista, eos_configs works well though it doesn&#39;t have commit confirm, which would be really really great to have. </p>

<p>@Ivan Thanks for your response. To be honest, this did concern me as well, and I wondered why the Ansible Network community using the project version wasn&rsquo;t engaging more with the broader Ansible community on the official forums.</p>

<p>The Ansible core team did reach out to the community through a forum post
https://forum.ansible.com/t/core-2-19-templating-changes-preview-and-testing/40759
to gather feedback on the pre-release version of ansible-core 2.19.</p>

<p>If you have any thoughts or suggestions on how the Ansible community can improve communication and feedback loops, we&rsquo;d really appreciate you sharing them.</p>

<p>&gt; Not only did nobody do that, it was first seen back in April and ignored for a few months: https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.netcommon/issues/698</p>

<p>Did you read the issue description? This issue was raised by an Ansible community team member on collection repository to raise awareness of the data tagging feature and its potential impact. In the comments, a contributor reported a specific problem, which was reviewed and addressed by the Ansible team.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m confident that if the issues discussed here had been raised in the appropriate GitHub repository, it would have been reviewed and addressed in a timely manner.</p>

<p>I did. The issue was raise and 2.19 was released anyway, breaking just about every network Ansible collection. Juniper&#39;s, Cisco&#39;s, etc. (the issue was netcommon). </p>

<p>Several people brought this up, including myself, and the Ansible team delayed Ansible Community 12 until fixes were made to netcommon. </p>

<p>That said we have noted the issue raised here and are working on identifying an appropriate fix.</p>

<p>Which elephant? I think there might be several... </p>

<p>One of the issues is the rather odd release method of Ansible. There&#39;s Ansible Community, and Ansible Core. Ansible Core (2.19) is what broke almost every network module in existence, primarily through netcommon, but there was other broken modules, like Arista AVD. </p>

<p>That preceded Ansible Community 12, so there was a time when even though 2.19 was broken, Community 11 which was still the current community release used 2.18. </p>

<p>The difference? Mostly it was &quot;pip3 install ansible&quot; versus &quot;pip3 install ansible-core&quot;. The former is what most people tended to use, so they were spared the breakage. </p>

<p>To the Ansible projects credit, the issue was finally addressed and Community 12 was delayed for a while (a month or so IIRC) until some fixes to netcommon were put in place. This... mostly... fixed the issues. </p>

<p>But what a wild ride it was, and easily avoidable. </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I&#39;ve long since come to the conclusion that Ansible is far too fast-moving, and consequently too fragile an ecosystem, to rely very much on for large production networks.  We still use it for specific targeted things, but increasingly find the vendor-specific modules to be useless for our needs (e.g. can&#39;t rename VLANs).
I <em><em>must</em></em> learn a fundamentally new way to configure my routers and switches about once every 5-10 years.  Whereas I must learn a substantially new way of doing &lt;something&gt; with Ansible at least once every six months, if I follow the current release.</p>

<p>I want to spend my time building useful networks, not RE-learning the tool that was supposed to save me time.</p>

<p>It would be enormously helpful if, like most other projects over the last 60 years, the MAJOR version number changed every time there was a breaking change, instead of semi-randomly on any given update.</p>

<p>In short, &quot;move fast and break things&quot; may work in the software world, but the entire philosophy is incompatible with production networks supporting 100k&#39;s of users.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I think this is a very reasonable frustration, and it is important to separate the upstream Ansible community project from Ansible Automation Platform as a product.</p>

<p>The Ansible community project moves quickly by design. Collections, modules, and plugins evolve independently and often at different speeds, driven by vendors and individual maintainers. If you track the latest community releases, you are intentionally opting into that velocity, which can result in churn and occasional breakage.</p>

<p>Ansible Automation Platform is intentionally different. It is a curated, enterprise product with a fixed and fully tested set of collections, long support lifecycles, backward compatibility guarantees within a major release, and a clear deprecation and migration process. Most customers pin to a specific AAP release and do not consume upstream changes unless they explicitly choose to.</p>

<p>This is also why the bug being discussed did not actually affect the product. It only existed in the upstream community project. The issue appeared in Ansible Core 2.19, which is newer than what we currently ship to customers in Ansible Automation Platform. Because customers were not yet exposed to that version, it did not surface through normal product usage and was something we missed upstream before it was discovered.</p>

<p>That distinction matters. This is not a case of the product breaking production networks. It is an example of upstream moving faster than the supported platform, which is exactly why the product exists in the first place.</p>

<p>On the broader point about relearning tools, I agree that production networks cannot operate on a move fast and break things model. Ansible Automation Platform is explicitly designed to avoid that philosophy. It exists to let network teams focus on building and operating stable networks while innovation continues upstream at a pace that does not disrupt production environments.</p>
