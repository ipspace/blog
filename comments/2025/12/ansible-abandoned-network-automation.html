<p>You might want to do a bit of research on GitHub before telling me that &quot;open source is not free&quot;, or is that too much of a bother?</p>

<p>Also, I did open an issue with Ansible a long while ago, and even submitted a pull request. After going through the pains of pushing that PR through, I decided to invest my time in other open-source projects.</p>

<p>Finally, as we all know, Ansible is not just any open-source project, and I have a bit higher bar for a project mostly funded by an IT behemoth than for something single-handedly maintained by a random person in Nebraska since 2003.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Ansible engineer here. This blog was recently brought to my attention.</p>

<p>The Ansible team continues to maintain, develop and enhance Ansible Network Automation. The Ansible Project Release 12, which uses ansible-core 2.19, introduced significant changes to the templating engine due to the new data tagging feature. It is most likely that you are encountering this issue because of those changes.</p>

<p>References:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ansible/comments/1k7n33q/preparing_your_playbooks_for_core219/</p>

<p>The latest product version, Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) 2.6, is based on ansible-core 2.16:</p>

<p>https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.6/html-single/release_notes/index</p>

<p>This is the reason users who are running ansible-core versions pinned to the product release have not encountered this issue.</p>

<p>That said, it would have been very helpful for the Ansible Network team to triage and prioritize fixing these issues if they had been raised in the relevant GitHub repositories.</p>

<p>&gt; The latest product version, Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) 2.6, is based on ansible-core 2.16</p>

<p>That&#39;s a very useful hint. I might pin my Ansible installations to the ansible-core version used by AAP and change that once AAP moves forward.</p>

<p>&gt; It would have been very helpful for the Ansible Network team to triage and prioritize fixing these issues if they had been raised in the relevant GitHub repositories</p>

<p>I completely agree, and if I were on the other side, I would be slightly worried that nobody did that, unless nobody is doing configuration templating any longer, in which case life&#39;s good.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I&#39;ve become more and more disheartened with the direction that the Ansible team is taking. It&#39;s become extremely apparent that the paid for Ansible Automation Platform is getting all of the love, ignoring those that have supported, developed for and evangelized Ansible for years as an option. Not even getting into the nightmare of what they did to AWX, but the features being more and more tied to AAP is a literal defination of enshittification. </p>

            <div class="comment-content">Someone added support for both SR OS and SR Linux back in 2021: https://github.com/ipspace/netlab/pull/57<br />

<p>At the time it made sense to use the GRPC collection, it was freshly created and allowed for both platforms to be configured in a similar way. Easier to maintain and switch between the two, was the thinking</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2025, and it turns out the SR OS team for whatever reason decided that this wasn&#39;t what they wanted to do. It is what it is.</p>
