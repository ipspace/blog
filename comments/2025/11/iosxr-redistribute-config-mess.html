So essentially redistribute everything and do everything else in the Route-Policy.</p>

<p>RPL is probably the main reason why such things work a bit differently in IOS-XR than in classic IOS.
I agree that this is cumbersome for templates, but personally I look at IOS-XR the same way I look at NX-OS: Completely different NOS (and the &quot;IOS&quot; in the name is more marketing than anything, imho).</p>
