            <div class="comment-content"><p>It&#39;s really been a long time since did something with redistribution in IOS-XR, but I guess you should be able to archive what you want to do by using a Route-Policy. So essentially redistribute everything and do everything else in the Route-Policy.</p>

<p>RPL is probably the main reason why such things work a bit differently in IOS-XR than in classic IOS.
I agree that this is cumbersome for templates, but personally I look at IOS-XR the same way I look at NX-OS: Completely different NOS (and the &quot;IOS&quot; in the name is more marketing than anything, imho).</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I agree with all you wrote (and netlab already has &quot;import with policy&quot; option, but I haven&#39;t implemented it for IOS/XR yet), but that&#39;s not an excuse to make the configuration commands so inconsistent.</p>

<p>They could have easily gone with &quot;simple redistribute only, use RPL for more complex stuff&quot; instead. Unfortunately, once you have the first big customers, that opportunity is gone (unless you&#39;re Nokia -- https://blog.ipspace.net/2025/04/api-data-model-contract/)</p>
