            <div class="comment-content"><p>One would think that the static IPv6 route would be imported after 5 sec (bgp scan-time command) at the latest. It looks like with IPv4 import is event driven (next-hop tracking) as one would expect it.  </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that behavior is a bug as it&#39;s 99.9 % of the case with that American scrap company. So open up a TAC case.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Very interesting write-up! IPv6 redistribution has always been a tricky area, and your explanation of how IOS/XE handles static routes is really helpful. As someone preparing for advanced certifications like CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure- https://ccielab.net/  I find these real-world scenarios invaluable in understanding routing behavior beyond the lab. Thanks for sharing such detailed insights &ndash; looking forward to more posts like this!</p>
