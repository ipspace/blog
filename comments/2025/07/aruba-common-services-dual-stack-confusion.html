            <div class="comment-content"><p>For a lot of use cases Netlab  already  generates  configurations which can can be considered &quot;best practices&quot;. And there is at least an individual in a  high profile organization appearing to use it that way,  if my memory serves me well. </p>

<p>Maybe it should also include some hard to pass tests out of the box. Not for &quot;digital twin&quot; purposes. But to be deployed on real hardware, and make conversations with SE a bit more targeted.  Netlab, &quot;The Verifier&quot; could be a legitimate use case at this point. </p>
