It looks like with IPv4 import is event driven (next-hop tracking) as one would expect it.  </p>\n\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that behavior is a bug as it&#39;s 99.9 % of the case with that American scrap company. So open up a TAC case.</p>\n",

As someone preparing for advanced certifications like CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure- https://ccielab.net/  I find these real-world scenarios invaluable in understanding routing behavior beyond the lab. Thanks for sharing such detailed insights &ndash; looking forward to more posts like this!</p>\n",
