It&#39;s a small wonder, he is wrong in  my opinion about shitloads of things, especially programming. But here it goes anyway. Let my people go surfing!</p>\n\n<p>tldr: a generalist is someone who can easily see constrains to an interdisciplinary problem. Not someone who sees the same crap in C and Python and Java. </p>\n\n<p>Uncle Bob is unable to recognize the value of a generalist. His value proposition is &quot;can we fit a Python developer as a valued member of Java team ? &quot; </p>\n\n<p>Of course you can. But unfortunately languages which you can talk, or have the ability to learn,  do not define a generalist. Languages are just a mean of expression. They are largely irrelevant for  how you think. Also largely irrelevant of domain specific knowledge you carry with you. And also, largely  irrelevant  (but weakly correlated ) to an individual&#39;s curiosity. </p>\n\n<p>Shoehorning a Python dev into Java, it&#39;s not an attempt to use generalist, but to &quot;specialize&quot; a guy who can express his thoughts in Python to do the same in Java.  </p>\n\n<p>A generalist imo, is someone with enough knowledge of related domains to clearly define the constrains on a interdisciplinary problem Someone who will prevent you from building on  RFC 1149 to have encrypted transport between sites 15 km apart. if you will, he is the engineer from Jules Verne&#39;s novels, or Bertrand&#39;s Russell&#39;s polymaths.  But no, not uncles Bob vision. he just shoehorns, instead of using the best characteristics of those people.  What a waste.</p>\n",
