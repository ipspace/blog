            <div class="comment-content">and after you install RA and DHCPv6 you find out that it only works &quot;out of the box&quot; on Windows Vista and Windows 7. For it to work on Windows XP or Ubuntu Linux you must install another dhcpv6 client.<br /><br />one would expect that 15+ years of IPv6 development would clarify and simplify those &quot;simple tasks&quot;, but no....<br /><br />Those things might work ok for some lab rats and ipv6 enthusiast, but &quot;Janez Novak&quot;  8-) just &quot;wants it to work&quot; (TM) - no installs, no configs and no manual configuration of either IP address OR rDNS server...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Problem is that some people wanted stateless IPv6 address autoconfiguration, and others wanted stateful. So somehow you need to express that policy to the end-nodes as to what to use. RAs do this. You could add a default gateway option to DHCPv6, and stop RA emitting routers from announcing themselves as default routers by setting the router lifetime to zero. But you&#39;re going to have need a SLAAC verses DHCPv6 conveyance mechanism regardless - and as RAs serve this purpose, why not use RAs to express that policy as well as announce a default router. In other words, the root cause of this situation is the dual and conflicting requirements of stateless and stateful addressing. I don&#39;t mind either of them too much, although I prefer stateless, but would have much preferred one or the other methods of address configuration, just not both. *DONT_KNOW*</div>

            <div class="comment-content">As most of the people trying to deploy IPv6 in production networks have found out, today you need BOTH - DHCPv6 to tell you the DNS server&#39;s address and RA to tell you who the default router is. One or the other could be used to set the host&#39;s IPv6 address.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I think you&#39;ve missed my point. How are you going to tell end-nodes to use stateful DHCPv6 OR stateless (SLAAC)? If you don&#39;t automate that via a link based announcement and/or request/response protocol of some sort, the only option left is manual end-node configuration - not practical in a large number of cases. RAs could be better described as &quot;IPv6 addressing model and parameter configuration protocol&quot;. Routers are a logical device to perform this function, and using their announcements to convey default router information is also a reasonable optimisation if they&#39;re going to be making periodic announcements or responding to solicitations for addressing configuration information anyway. Note that if you set the router lifetime in an RA to zero, then end-nodes won&#39;t use the router as a default gateway, yet can still use the information in them e.g. PIO, for addressing model etc. configuration.<br /><br />The main reason people seem to say they want to use stateful DHCPv6 is that they want to record MAC address / IPv6 address mappings for audit purposes. I think that can easily be achieved in the stateless model by having a router (or another appropriate device) notice when DAD is initially occurring, tentatively place that end-node information in the neighbor cache if it doesn&#39;t conflict with existing entries, and then have NUD generate a SNMP trap when the address is determined to be not a duplicate, and have NUD genarate another SNMP trap when the neighbor cache entry is removed. Since it would be quite simple to create audit logs of address usage in a stateless model using this method, I think DHCPv6 for addressing mostly just exists because &quot;that&#39;s how hit works in IPv4&quot;. A shame really, it seems like the most popular criticism of IPv6 is support for the two different addressing configuration models.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Mark, I understand all you&#39;re saying and I agree with most of it. However, I still claim it&#39;s stupid you need BOTH SLAAC and stateless DHCPv6 (to pass DNS server address) if you want to auto-configure your end hosts. <br /><br />I know the new RFCs are out, but yet again, why did it take 10+ years to realize the problem ... and when will we have them available in all desktop OS where they matter most?</div>
