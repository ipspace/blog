Finally someone really explained the meaning of the MTU value on EIGRP, thanks !",

      "html": "Hello Ivan,  <br /> <br />I hope this message reaches you. I have tried to verify the assumption about MTU being a tie-breaker in path selection on a lab gear but to my dismay, manipulating the MTU had no effect whatsoever on EIGRP&#39;s path selection - whether it were equal-cost best paths or equal-cost feasible successor paths, both with and without the &quot;maximum-metric&quot; command.  <br /> <br />After talking to a gentleman from Cisco closely involved with EIGRP, he confirmed that the idea of using MTU was considered but never really implemented.  <br /> <br />So I wonder... is there any document that would say otherwise? Alternatively, do you have a suggested test config that worked for you?  <br /> <br />The issue of MTU in EIGRP is admittedly a neverending story... :-D  <br /> <br />Best regards,  <br />Peter Pal\u00fach  <br />CCIE #23527 R&amp;S, CCIP, Cisco CSC Designated VIP 2011-2012",

      "html": "Hello Ivan,<br /><br />Thank you very much for responding.<br /><br />I made sure from the beginning that all you suggested was the case - more routes than allowed by &quot;maximum-paths&quot;, MTU being correctly reflected in EIGRP topology database and properly shown even in the &quot;show ip route X.X.X.X&quot; output afterwards. However, the results stand - the MTU does not appear to have any effect. The timing may have contributed to the confusion here - sometimes the routing table displayed the routes with the highest available MTUs, but disabling an interface on a path with a high MTU and reenabling it later did not cause the EIGRP to reinstate the route with the highest available MTU - the existing routes simply stayed in the routing table and were not preempted by higher-MTU paths.<br /><br />Any ideas?<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Peter",

Cisco employees I talked to were absolutely adamant that there is no regard in EIGRP to the MTU in the best path selection process. I also could not see any effect of MTU on the path selection as I conducted my experiments, in alignment with your recommendations.<br /><br />Thank you very much!<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Peter",

      "html": "I&#39;ve made a thorough test and got the following results:<br /><br />1. There is no MTU tie-breaker in best path selection algorithm. When several routes with same CD but different MTU exist in the topology table, only route age in the topology table serves as a tie-breaker: first come - first served. The order of receiving update matters only.<br /><br />1a. When a router receive a route with the same CD as the current successor, it just installs them in the RIB. If it cannot install the route in RIB because of maximum-paths limit, it just ignores the route disregarding its MTU. So the routes are installed simply in the order or receiving updates, even if the first updates had lower MTU.<br /><br />1b. Even if we reduce maximum-paths on the fly, the router prefers those routes that were received first, disregarding MTU.<br /><br />2. In some situations there is a correlation between MTU and received updates order, so better-MTU updates come first.<br /><br />2a. The effect is very weak. It&#39;s stronger on old IOSes; on newer hardware or virtual platforms I wasn&#39;t able to reproduce it.<br /><br />2b. It obviously depends on a topology.<br /><br />2c. I still cannot understand what causes this effect.",
