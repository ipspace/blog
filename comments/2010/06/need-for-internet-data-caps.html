            <div class="comment-content">I later refined this thought to the following : Why not attack the 3% and solve the smaller problem, instead of solving the bigger problem and wasting money. <br /><br />You have answered that question by pointing out that they can generate extra revenue. I also agree that it very short sighted. <br /><br />greg</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Service providers are complaining that customers are beginning to actually consume what was advertised and what they have been paying for. In response, ISPs need to either better invest in their infrastructure to support the services they have promised, or advertise more realistic speeds (e.g. 20 Mbps burst with a CIR of only 2 Mbps). It&#39;s that simple. Transfer caps are merely an *additional,* unnecessary restriction on what is already a policed service.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Now we&#39;re in perfect alignment. Regardless what each of us thinks, offering 20 Mbps (or 100 Mbps) CIR @ current prices is totally unrealistic, but the terms &amp; conditions should have been very obvious from the beginning.</div>
