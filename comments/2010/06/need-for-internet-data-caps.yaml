  html: 'I later refined this thought to the following : Why not attack the 3% and
    solve the smaller problem, instead of solving the bigger problem and wasting money.
    <br /><br />You have answered that question by pointing out that they can generate
    extra revenue. I also agree that it very short sighted. <br /><br />greg'

  html: 'All &amp; every user consumes 3% of the time the top 3% of the bandwidth
    and that will be capped, not just 3% of the total user base.<br /><br />Ergo:
    your peaks will at some given moment in time be reason to cap|discuss your connected
    activities, or simply charge more.'

  html: Service providers are complaining that customers are beginning to actually
    consume what was advertised and what they have been paying for. In response, ISPs
    need to either better invest in their infrastructure to support the services they
    have promised, or advertise more realistic speeds (e.g. 20 Mbps burst with a CIR
    of only 2 Mbps). It&#39;s that simple. Transfer caps are merely an *additional,*
    unnecessary restriction on what is already a policed service.

  html: Now we&#39;re in perfect alignment. Regardless what each of us thinks, offering
    20 Mbps (or 100 Mbps) CIR @ current prices is totally unrealistic, but the terms
    &amp; conditions should have been very obvious from the beginning.
