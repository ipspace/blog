      "html": "Problem is that some people wanted stateless IPv6 address autoconfiguration, and others wanted stateful. So somehow you need to express that policy to the end-nodes as to what to use. RAs do this. You could add a default gateway option to DHCPv6, and stop RA emitting routers from announcing themselves as default routers by setting the router lifetime to zero. But you&#39;re going to have need a SLAAC verses DHCPv6 conveyance mechanism regardless - and as RAs serve this purpose, why not use RAs to express that policy as well as announce a default router. In other words, the root cause of this situation is the dual and conflicting requirements of stateless and stateful addressing. I don&#39;t mind either of them too much, although I prefer stateless, but would have much preferred one or the other methods of address configuration, just not both. *DONT_KNOW*",

      "html": "I think you&#39;ve missed my point. How are you going to tell end-nodes to use stateful DHCPv6 OR stateless (SLAAC)? If you don&#39;t automate that via a link based announcement and/or request/response protocol of some sort, the only option left is manual end-node configuration - not practical in a large number of cases. RAs could be better described as &quot;IPv6 addressing model and parameter configuration protocol&quot;. Routers are a logical device to perform this function, and using their announcements to convey default router information is also a reasonable optimisation if they&#39;re going to be making periodic announcements or responding to solicitations for addressing configuration information anyway. Note that if you set the router lifetime in an RA to zero, then end-nodes won&#39;t use the router as a default gateway, yet can still use the information in them e.g. PIO, for addressing model etc. configuration.<br /><br />The main reason people seem to say they want to use stateful DHCPv6 is that they want to record MAC address / IPv6 address mappings for audit purposes. I think that can easily be achieved in the stateless model by having a router (or another appropriate device) notice when DAD is initially occurring, tentatively place that end-node information in the neighbor cache if it doesn&#39;t conflict with existing entries, and then have NUD generate a SNMP trap when the address is determined to be not a duplicate, and have NUD genarate another SNMP trap when the neighbor cache entry is removed. Since it would be quite simple to create audit logs of address usage in a stateless model using this method, I think DHCPv6 for addressing mostly just exists because &quot;that&#39;s how hit works in IPv4&quot;. A shame really, it seems like the most popular criticism of IPv6 is support for the two different addressing configuration models.",
