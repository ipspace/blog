So, I dont want the provider&#39;s network being exposed to consumer without my wish. For that instead of routing protocol, I am adding/removing static route for providers&#39; network. <br />Could you please tell me <br />1) if there is any other way.<br />2) if I can use phase 3 dmvpn while using statis route ?<br /><br />-regards,<br />Rachna",
