            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I have been using NAT64/DNS64 from Viagenie for a while now and it worked decent. The mechanism of translation obviously is dependent on DNS though. I am now looking for a translation mechanism for IPv6 only hosts to access IPv4 only internet without DNS (for those applications that do not make DNS queries). Are there any options for such a scenario? I couldn&#39;t find any.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Roman,<br /><br />How many clients do you have going through the NAT64 from Viagenie simultaneously? A friend of mine was testing NAT64 as a translation platform for an IPv6 conference (his Wifi access was IPv6-only) and claimed that the Viagenie software crashed on him.<br /><br />As for the stupidities such as IPv4 addresses encoded in URLs, there&#39;s nothing we can do.<br /><br />Thank you!<br />Ivan</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi,<br /><br />The software crashes indeed from time to time and it does not depend on the number of users from my experience. It is surely more of a prototype. By saying &quot;worked decent&quot; I was mainly referring to the thing that it does the job well. When it comes to stability though - there is a long way to go. It would be nice if Viagenie would release a less buggy version, I am however not sure it is within their scope.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">It seems to me that isn&#39;t quite all we can do... By changing what socket() family of calls do on the client with AF_INET (which seems feasible if we&#39;re talking about an IPv6 only network), we could make AF_INET calls get translated to being AF_INET6 with the source address being the IPv6 address, and the destination being the WNP + IPv4 address or some other prefix, perhaps handed out with DHCPv6 or through some stateless mechanism.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">We could do much more if we would have been able to modify host TCP stack or socket API. Unfortunately, that&#39;s unrealistic.<br /><br />But you&#39;re right; your proposal would make DNS64 irrelevant.</div>
