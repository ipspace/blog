Thank you. :)<br /><br />one more question, to you feel that the &quot;multi-area IS-IS configuration&quot; that often found in many docs should be referred to as &quot;multi-process IS-IS configuration&quot;? The wording of the area really made me mad, same like VTP, VLAN trunking procotol, that has nothing to do with VLAN trunking. 8-)",
