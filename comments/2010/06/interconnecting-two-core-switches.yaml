  html: Im looking for the best method to connect multiple 3750&#39;s over my wireless
    wan. Currently the Mikrotik&#39;s running RouterOS handle all the routing and
    tunneling but I would like to change this so that the Cisco 3750&#39;s handle
    the routing and tunneling. The reason for this is that I need to create 3 VLANs
    (Voip, Servers and PC&#39;s) and the way the network is currently setup would
    mean a massive amount of routing would need to be added or changed.<br /><br />Any
    advice will be greatly appreciated.<br />Kid Regards,<br />Mike
