      "html": "With regards to the &quot;simplified packet header for routing efficiency&quot;. There is actually something to this claim. With a fixed header size compared to IPv4&#39;s variable length header, the 64 bit alignment and the removal of the checksum. One could certainly make the claim that the header is better optimized for forwarding than the IPv4 one.<br /><br />Options in IPv4 aren&#39;t used and the checksum isn&#39;t that hard to compute.  The benefit of 64 bit alignment, especially if the L2 header isn&#39;t aligned isn&#39;t that great and compared to the lookup of the much longer address I doubt anyone has an implementation with equal hardware forwarding IPv6 faster than IPv4. But sure, the _intention_ of making IPv6 better was there.",

      "html": "You&#39;re absolutely correct. However, most of the other IPv6 benefits were true 15 years ago when the standards were ready, including the &quot;reduction in IPv6 routing tables due to hierarchical addressing&quot;, &quot;better QoS (due to flow field)&quot;, &quot;better mobility&quot; and even &quot;better security&quot; (IPSec on IPv4 was rare in those days). Today they are just myths.<br /><br />Going into technical details: it&#39;s my understanding that while IPv6 headers might be better aligned than IPv4 headers, they always require extension headers, which could be routing options or upper layer protocols. Forwarding IPv6 packets thus always requires a lookup into the extension headers, whether it&#39;s needed or not, while checking the length of IPv4 header (and, in most cases, dropping any packet with options) is a simple comparison.",

      "html": "Forwarding of an IPv6 packet does not require that a router look into the L4 header or extension headers. Features like ACLs might require it, just like for IPv4.<br /><br />In fact I have it from a reliable source that IPv6 was specifically designed to make it hard for routers to look any deeper into the packet than the L3 header.<br /><br />Too early to say, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if extension headers will be as rare as IPv4 options are.<br /><br />But just to be clear, I fully agree with you. IPv6 is all about the extra address space. Allowing the continuing growth of the Internet. The other changes are insignificant.",
