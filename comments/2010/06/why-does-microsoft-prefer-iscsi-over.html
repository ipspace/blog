            <div class="comment-content">I think you have been reading my mind. Microsoft makes most of its money from medium and small companies, and these people have finite budgets. Fibrechannel doesn&#39;t reduce cost, it increases cost by forcing companies to deploy low latency, high speed,  zero loss networking when other technologies are good enough. <br /><br />I agree with your opinion. Fibrechannel looks like SNA to me.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">In M$ doesn&#39;t support FCoE natively then this is opportunity window for manufacturers of FCoE HBA&#39;s which looks like native FC HBA&#39;s looking from the bus side. This solves the problem of performance, CPU offload and every OS which support FC adapters will work with this solutions.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&quot;Guest&quot;  I&#39;ll take a unpopular stance and say I like FC.  Is it limited in it&#39;s life?  Probably..  But right now there are things that make it the lowest common denominator.  When setting yourself up for tape or backup to tape too often the interface thats available is FC.  When looking at inline encrypting from vendors like brocade or cisco it&#39;s FC.  When looking at vendor extension tools like V-Plex from EMC it&#39;s based off of FC.<br /><br />So while I agree with the arguments from the Author it&#39;s more from a networking perspective.  If you look at it from a SAN admin&#39;s perspective you see things a little differently.  Ultimately though FCOE or iSCSI will eventually be adopted more and FC will go away.<br /><br />Thats just the way I see it.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I stopped caring about &quot;popular&quot; years ago and decided it matters more to get things working.<br /><br />First of all, thanks for a healthy dose of reality. I was focused too much on storage arrays and forgot to check the tape part of the equation.<br /><br />However, looking at the bigger picture, FCoE by itself makes no sense to me. It&#39;s a viable integration technology if you have FC network (or are forced to use one, as you explained), but I see no reason why I&#39;d deploy it by itself. Am I wrong?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">1. FC is supported by Windows. Hyper-V even has a virtual FC capability.<br />2. You don&#39;t need built-it OS support to deploy something. That&#39;s what the install button is for. The built-in iSCSI target on WIndows is s*** anyway. You can&#39;t make disks into LUNs. LUNs can only be made from VHD files, not even VHDX.<br />3. FCoE advocates can argue that FCoE makes sense since many new iSCSI deployments use DCB anyway. <br />4. I agree. The different SAN protocols provide too many solutions to the same problem. At most we should have two protocols. Raw L2 ones like AoE (I don&#39;t think FCoE has a networking layer either) or TCP/IP ones like iSCSI. We don&#39;t need 40 different protocols like iFCP or FCPIP. There is a reason the whole world use TCP/IP and ethernet. You don&#39;t need custom (overpriced) hardware to get better bandwidth. Just make Ethernet faster and everyone is happy. <br /></div>
