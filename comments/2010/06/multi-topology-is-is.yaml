  html: Hi Ivan, is the concept of this multi-topology is basically the same thing
    as the &quot;multi-area&quot; or &quot;multi-process&quot; IS-IS to be precise.
    Thank you. :)<br /><br />one more question, to you feel that the &quot;multi-area
    IS-IS configuration&quot; that often found in many docs should be referred to
    as &quot;multi-process IS-IS configuration&quot;? The wording of the area really
    made me mad, same like VTP, VLAN trunking procotol, that has nothing to do with
    VLAN trunking. 8-)
