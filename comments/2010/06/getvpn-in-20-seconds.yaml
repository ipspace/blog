  html: You said &quot;You cannot use GETVPN to transport data sent between hosts
    with private IP addresses across public IP infrastructure (for example, the Internet)&quot;<br
    /><br />But if we have a DMVPN network we can then use GETVPN, right?

    html: Not directly, as the traffic is no longer IP at that point... unless of

    html: Don&#39;t think so (but then &quot;never say never&quot;) - NAT in the path
      will most probably totally mess everything up.

  html: Hi,<br />Is it possible to bring GET VPN between 2 endpoints, if the remote
    site (branch) has private ip address? Normally should not work, but worth to ask.<br
    /><br />Regards,
