Have a look at http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/ for more info.",

      "html": "Thanks for the link; it&#39;s a great document. I&#39;m somewhat aware of how caches work, after all, I wrote a few articles after implementing it on my web sites:<br /><br />http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=663080<br />http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=665932<br />http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=669598<br /><br />The idea mentioned in the podcast goes beyond web caching. Imagine you build the page content dynamically: it might be retrieved from a database or you have to combine static descriptions with comments, reviews and the like. Sometimes it takes a while to retrieve the data and build HTML (or, in my case, XML), so if your site is overloaded or under attack, it&#39;s better to serve a cached snapshot to NEW (not RETURNING) visitors instead of spending time trying to build it from scratch.<br /><br />BTW, Mediawiki (the Wikipedia engine) has implemented something very similar for high-performance retrievals.",
