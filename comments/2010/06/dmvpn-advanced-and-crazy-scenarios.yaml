  html: Hey mate, <br /><br />I&#39;ve got one... DMVPN (dual hub, dual cloud) over
    international links crossing multiple ISP&#39;s for the spokes, Hubs based in
    Aus. Crazy crazy solution when carriers don&#39;t want to run Inter-AS VPNs. :(<br
    /><br />Cheers,<br />Joe.

  html: Ivan,<br /><br />Don&#39;t forget about FVRF/IVRF applied to DMVPN as well:<br
    /><br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6660/prod_white_paper0900aecd8034be03_ps6658_Products_White_Paper.html<br
    /><br />It&#39;s a great solution for when your spokes need to carry a default
    for client internet traffic (transparent proxy at the hub) and also require a
    default route for spoke-to-spoke tunnel creation.<br /><br />Steve

    html: If I understand your intent correctly, you need something that could authenticate
      the users. There might be something in the IKE framework that would give you
      the tools you need, or you could use per-user keys with hub-and-spoke DMVPN
      (just guessing).<br /><br />Also check the new FlexVPN solutions - it&#39;s
      supposed to be a mixture of the goodies from all previous IPsec-based VPN technologies
      ;)

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I like the way you explain complex things in simple language.<br
    />I have to setup DMVPN in consumer-provider network where i can control the service
    consumption. So, I dont want the provider&#39;s network being exposed to consumer
    without my wish. For that instead of routing protocol, I am adding/removing static
    route for providers&#39; network. <br />Could you please tell me <br />1) if there
    is any other way.<br />2) if I can use phase 3 dmvpn while using statis route
    ?<br /><br />-regards,<br />Rachna
