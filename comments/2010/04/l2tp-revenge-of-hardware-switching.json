However, it looks like it works for dynamic virtual template interfaces.  Was there perhaps something specific that didn&#39;t work?",

      "html": "The overall goal was to provide a cheap backup route for inter-LAN connectivity between two sites.  I use GRE-over-IPsec to provide the virtual WAN link.<br /><br />The twist was that there are two sets of networks that must be routed across the virtual link to the remote side.  I&#39;ll call them &quot;SecureLAN&quot; and &quot;InsecureLAN.&quot;  These networks exist at both sites, and each LAN is separated by a firewall at each site.<br /><br />The routes distributed by the IGP within &quot;InsecureLAN&quot; and &quot;SecureLAN&quot; overlap with each other.  Moreover, &quot;InsecureLAN&quot; must carry a default route through the virtual WAN link to the remote side.<br /><br />What I did, instead of using two pairs of routers for each network, was to configure a pair of 3825 routers with two named VRF instances.  One named VRF was used for the InsecureLAN, and another named VRF, &quot;Inet&quot;, was used for the Internet-facing interface.  SecureLAN was connected to the routers&#39; global VRF.<br /><br />IPsec operates within the &quot;Inet&quot; VRF only.<br /><br />The reason I decided to create a named VRF for the Internet-facing LAN connection, and to use VRF-aware IPsec, is very similar to the reason you gave in your earlier post: It is much easier to manage and administer the router within the global VRF.  Also, at deployment time, I believe there were some needed management options that were not VRF-aware in that IOS rev.<br /><br />To finish talking about the design, two GRE tunnel interfaces are set up on each router, one for &quot;InsecureLAN&quot; and one for &quot;SecureLAN.&quot;  The IP address endpoints are the same for each tunnel interface; GRE keying is used to differentiate each tunnel.",

      "html": "Applying vrf to l2tp tunnels via radius seems to be a problem on the ASR&#39;s as well or is related. Once the vrf is set via the cisco avpairs the ipcp process stops and peers never get to learn/negotiate addresses. This has the effect that the tunnel addresses are not assigned and the framed routes are not placed in the vrf routing table.",
