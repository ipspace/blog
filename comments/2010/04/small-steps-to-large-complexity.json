Could you apply a route-map to each of the interfaces on the LNS router with no match statement, and make it set the exit interface to the opposite interface?  You wouldn&#39;t need to know any addresses, just interfaces.<br /><br />Ian.",

      "html": "Hi! I don&#39;t use L2TP in my network but I have somewhat similar setup with DMVPN, where SP provides IP connectivity from spokes to hub within SP&#39;s network and Internet access is being router centrally via a firewall. I was posed with the same question, which way the default route should be pointed, since spokes&#39; addresses are dynamic. <br />So I resolved this with the following configuration at hub:<br />crypto dynamic-map [SP-DMVPN map name] 10<br /> set transform-set [DMVPN TS name]<br /> reverse-route remote-peer [next hop at SP&#39;s side] gateway<br />interface GigabitEthernet0/0.2<br /> description SP tunnel termination<br /> ip address [SP provided address]<br /> service-policy output [SP-DMVPN map name]<br />0/0 route is being received by this router via OSPF and points to the campus core network.<br /><br />Now when spokes dynamically establish IPSec with hub, crypto subsystem adds static routes pointing to their Internet IPs via hub&#39;s SP-facing interface:<br /><br />tunnelhub#sh crypto route<br /><br />VPN Routing Table: Shows RRI and VTI created routes<br />Codes: RRI - Reverse-Route, VTI- Virtual Tunnel Interface<br />        S - Static Map ACLs<br /><br />Routes created in table GLOBAL DEFAULT<br />[spoke SP IP]/255.255.255.255 [1/0] via [hub SP nexthop] tag 0<br />                                on GigabitEthernet0/0.2 RRI<br /><br />I&#39;m really not sure if this is applicable for L2TP, anyway, maybe someone would find this hint useful.",

      "html": "I would look into establishing a separate VRF for the internal interfaces of the LNS router, specifically the internal Ethernet interface and the Virtual-Template interface.<br /><br />One could also put the external interface in a VRF, but that is more complex and may not be supported in PPPoE/L2TP.  (I do know for a fact it is supported in recent versions of IOS&#39; IPsec implementation.)<br /><br />Not having worked with PPPoE/L2TP, I couldn&#39;t tell you without research whether VRF-based separation would work.",
