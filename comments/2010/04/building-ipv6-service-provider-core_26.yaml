  html: Hum.. the last time i was participating in webex call i was able to change
    audio settings and increase the amount of voice buffering to improve the quality
    but to sacrifice a delay, which helped me to understand host more clearly (i was
    connected over poor wireless connection). The thing is.. i cannot remember exactly
    where i found that setting.. I joined the webex demo just now to find it, but
    the mentioned parameter is not among the settings I&#39;m able to set. I believe
    it is so due to the settings of the session. Also searched through webex docs
    site but i wasn&#39;t able to find any info about buffer settings. <br />So in
    general that could be done on the client site to improve audio, but it looks like
    i&#39;ll have to wait for another webex session to be able to report where to
    find that particular setting.
