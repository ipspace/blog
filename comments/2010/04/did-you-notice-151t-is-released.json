It is the first mainline release, long lived and bugfix only.  <br /> <br />15.1T starts the &quot;.1 epoch&quot; of releases.  <br /> <br />15.1(1)T, (2)T, (3)T will be shorter lived feature releases that each add new features. At some point, the .1 epoch will be feature complete and will graduate to the &quot;M&quot; marker at 15.1(x)M. That M release will be long lived. The value of x is not currently known.  <br /> <br />When (or slightly before) 15.1 becomes a mainline, 15.2(1)T will be the first release of the &quot;.2 epoch&quot; of releases. 15.2(1)T, 15.2(2)T will each be shorter-lived feature-add releases that add features. 15.2T will graduate to &quot;M&quot; status once feature complete after some number of releases.  <br /> <br />Repeat for each epoch, 15.3, 15.4, etc, etc.  The &quot;T&quot; changed to &quot;M&quot; when the train is feature complete.  <br /> <br />Logically, M and T are the same software base in this model - the M just serves as a lifecycle marker, like the Ubuntu LTS marker.  <br /> <br />The &quot;S&quot; family of releases run a similar process, but all S releases are called &quot;S&quot; regardless of long lived or short lived status. The planned lifecycle of an S release is determined from the release notes.  <br /> <br />It is critical to note that the 15.1 T and 15.1 S releases will NOT share the exact branch of code the same way that as in the 12.x families. There will be a lot of parts in common, but you cannot assume that 15.1(x)T and 15.1(x)S will be feature-for-feature or bug-for-bug compatible like you could in the 12 releases.  <br /> <br />http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html is a pretty good reference. (Oh, snap, it doesn&#39;t cover the IOS 15 shift...)  <br /> <br />The docs on the web site are lacking in detail. The &quot;graduate to M&quot; idea is not well covered. The new numbering scheme sought to shy away from &quot;low numbers&quot; on a mainline release - &quot;M&quot; now becomes a marker rather than an independent software release train.",
