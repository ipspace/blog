  html: '&quot;Cisco 7200 series and Cisco 7301 routers will continue to be supported
    in Cisco IOS 15.x(x)M releases. Only the Cisco IOS 15.x(x)T releases will not
    support the Cisco 7200 series and Cisco 7301 routers. &quot;<br /><br />Well I
    guess it&#39;s time to see if 2800 emulation is doable.'

  html: I have to admit, I&#39;m totally confused by their new numbering schemes.
    There&#39;s a product bulleting &quot;explaining&quot; them, but it only made
    me more confused.

  html: When I was at the ISRg2 launch event in boston they explained it and it made
    complete sense, but since the presenter never followed up with the slides like
    he said I completely forget the procedures. <br /><br />it is something to the
    effect of the 15.0T becomes 15.1M after testing completes, or something like that

    find if a bug fixed in release A is fixed in release B.  They will understand

    forget to commit fixes in the branches where the bugs were discovered.  They will
    master the double numbering of IOS-XE and the sudden change from 12.2XN to 15.0S.'

  html: The Delta between the 15T and the next 15M release is much shorter than what
    it used to be. Once the next M version becomes available you can run the same
    feature on the 7200 as well.

  html: It&#39;s quite simple. The 15.0(1)M gets released. Now, all development will
    continue in releases that will be numbered from 15.1(1)T, until fixed amount of
    time passes - currently 20 months, and then new mainline release will be available
    - like for example 15.2(1)M. However, there&#39;s no &quot;mainline&quot; anymore,
    as there&#39;s one software track.<br /><br />However, between 20 months cycle,
    there will be rebuilds of software already available, and we already seen that
    - there&#39;s 15.0(2)M as a rebuild of 15.0(1)M and so on.

  html: '@mr0vka : Not exactly correct.  <br /> <br />15.0M is a transition between
    12 and 15. &quot;M&quot; indicates a long-lived mainline release. It is the first
    mainline release, long lived and bugfix only.  <br /> <br />15.1T starts the &quot;.1
    epoch&quot; of releases.  <br /> <br />15.1(1)T, (2)T, (3)T will be shorter lived
    feature releases that each add new features. At some point, the .1 epoch will
    be feature complete and will graduate to the &quot;M&quot; marker at 15.1(x)M.
    That M release will be long lived. The value of x is not currently known.  <br
    /> <br />When (or slightly before) 15.1 becomes a mainline, 15.2(1)T will be the
    first release of the &quot;.2 epoch&quot; of releases. 15.2(1)T, 15.2(2)T will
    each be shorter-lived feature-add releases that add features. 15.2T will graduate
    to &quot;M&quot; status once feature complete after some number of releases.  <br
    /> <br />Repeat for each epoch, 15.3, 15.4, etc, etc.  The &quot;T&quot; changed
    to &quot;M&quot; when the train is feature complete.  <br /> <br />Logically,
    M and T are the same software base in this model - the M just serves as a lifecycle
    marker, like the Ubuntu LTS marker.  <br /> <br />The &quot;S&quot; family of
    releases run a similar process, but all S releases are called &quot;S&quot; regardless
    of long lived or short lived status. The planned lifecycle of an S release is
    determined from the release notes.  <br /> <br />It is critical to note that the
    15.1 T and 15.1 S releases will NOT share the exact branch of code the same way
    that as in the 12.x families. There will be a lot of parts in common, but you
    cannot assume that 15.1(x)T and 15.1(x)S will be feature-for-feature or bug-for-bug
    compatible like you could in the 12 releases.  <br /> <br />http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html
    is a pretty good reference. (Oh, snap, it doesn&#39;t cover the IOS 15 shift...)  <br
    /> <br />The docs on the web site are lacking in detail. The &quot;graduate to
    M&quot; idea is not well covered. The new numbering scheme sought to shy away
    from &quot;low numbers&quot; on a mainline release - &quot;M&quot; now becomes
    a marker rather than an independent software release train.'
