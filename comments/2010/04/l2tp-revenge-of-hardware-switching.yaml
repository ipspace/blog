  html: weeks ago i came to the same conclusion about this so called NG platform -
    ASR<br />i can add that ZBF with zone-pair in VRFs is also not working, same goes
    for NAT with VASI iface.<br />concerning VRF-aware L2TP, which hardware/software
    version are you using? i&#39;ve been successful with it!<br /><br />cheers, henrique

  html: I use IPsec termination in a VRF today, and it works well.<br /><br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/sec_secure_connectivity/configuration/guide/sec_vrf_aware_ipsec.html<br
    /><br />I use it only for a single static point-to-point tunnel, so it&#39;s not
    very complex.  However, it looks like it works for dynamic virtual template interfaces.  Was
    there perhaps something specific that didn&#39;t work?

  html: VRF-aware L2TP is fine, it&#39;s just the combination with IPSec that doesn&#39;t
    work.

  html: humm... interesting, i need run the same but with VASIrightx interface has
    a IPSec tunnel end point

  html: 'The overall goal was to provide a cheap backup route for inter-LAN connectivity
    between two sites.  I use GRE-over-IPsec to provide the virtual WAN link.<br /><br
    />The twist was that there are two sets of networks that must be routed across
    the virtual link to the remote side.  I&#39;ll call them &quot;SecureLAN&quot;
    and &quot;InsecureLAN.&quot;  These networks exist at both sites, and each LAN
    is separated by a firewall at each site.<br /><br />The routes distributed by
    the IGP within &quot;InsecureLAN&quot; and &quot;SecureLAN&quot; overlap with
    each other.  Moreover, &quot;InsecureLAN&quot; must carry a default route through
    the virtual WAN link to the remote side.<br /><br />What I did, instead of using
    two pairs of routers for each network, was to configure a pair of 3825 routers
    with two named VRF instances.  One named VRF was used for the InsecureLAN, and
    another named VRF, &quot;Inet&quot;, was used for the Internet-facing interface.  SecureLAN
    was connected to the routers&#39; global VRF.<br /><br />IPsec operates within
    the &quot;Inet&quot; VRF only.<br /><br />The reason I decided to create a named
    VRF for the Internet-facing LAN connection, and to use VRF-aware IPsec, is very
    similar to the reason you gave in your earlier post: It is much easier to manage
    and administer the router within the global VRF.  Also, at deployment time, I
    believe there were some needed management options that were not VRF-aware in that
    IOS rev.<br /><br />To finish talking about the design, two GRE tunnel interfaces
    are set up on each router, one for &quot;InsecureLAN&quot; and one for &quot;SecureLAN.&quot;  The
    IP address endpoints are the same for each tunnel interface; GRE keying is used
    to differentiate each tunnel.'

  html: Perfectly sane ... but you&#39;re using 3825 routers, which are software switching
    platforms, so they can take almost any abuse you throw at them.

  html: Applying vrf to l2tp tunnels via radius seems to be a problem on the ASR&#39;s
    as well or is related. Once the vrf is set via the cisco avpairs the ipcp process
    stops and peers never get to learn/negotiate addresses. This has the effect that
    the tunnel addresses are not assigned and the framed routes are not placed in
    the vrf routing table.

  html: Hello Ivan, <br /><br />do you know if this L2TP/IPsec and VRF interop issue
    is still there in latest IOS-XE ?<br /><br />Thanks<br />

  html: I made L2TP/IPSEC work for VRFs on the 4451-X which has the same quantum flow
    architecture as the ASR. You must install an ACL to exclude your your VPN network
    from being NAT&#39;d beforehand or you won&#39;t be able to ping anything other
    than an interface IP on directly connected interfaces and private networks derived
    by your VRF&#39;s IGP.<br /><br />ip access-list extended L2TP_INSIDE_VRF_OMIT_NAT<br
