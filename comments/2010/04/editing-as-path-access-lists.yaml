  html: Usually edit offline and upload, but try to avoid AS-Path ACLs in favour of
    std-community based route policies (co-operating peers and upstreams are always
    far better :)

  html: I think such mechanism doesn&#39;t exist in Cisco IOS. But it is not necessary.
    In case of ACL on interface traffic flow continuously. If we remove ACL - it will
    be a disaster. As-path access-list works only when there is a change somewhere
    in BGP table. So it is not terrible to remove it and then to paste new one with
    the same number. At least it works pretty well with small as-path ACLs.  ;) As
    concerns long as-pasth ACLs and huge BGP tables... What is the real task? In most
    cases, I think, you have to avoid as-path ACLs (see previous comment) and use
    communities (if it is possible :) ) or a script that will query whois databases
    and bogon route-servers to compile incredible long ip prefix-lists.

  html: I&#39;m generating and uploading BGP filters automatically from a NMS. The
    best way to construct BGP filters (as-path based or prefix-list based) is to query
    RADB, since RADB mirrors all other routing registry databases. RADB also provides
    a nice mechanism to expand customer as-sets recursively:<br /><br />whois -h whois.radb.net
    \!iAS-SET,1<br /><br />From that one constructing the as-path acl is easy - you
    can use even an one-liner like this:<br /><br />whois -h whois.radb.net \!iAS-SET,1
    | head -2 | tail -1 | fmt - 70 | tr &#39;[as]&#39; &#39;[AS]&#39; | fmt -50 |
    \<br />sed -e &#39;s/AS/|/g&#39; -e &#39;s/\ //g&#39; -e &#39;s/$/\)\$/g&#39;
    -e &#39;s/^|/ip\ as-path\ access-list NNN\ permit\ \_\(/g&#39;

  html: So - when will Cisco fix this limitation?  It makes no sense that you cannot
    delete one line of config without inadvertently removing the whole ip as-path
    access-list.<br /><br />Example:<br />ip as-path access-list 90 permit ^5400_7018<br
    />ip as-path access-list 90 permit ^5400_1239<br /><br />Action:<br />no ip as-path
    access-list 90 permit ^5400_7018<br /><br />Result:<br />[ip as-path access-list
    90 is GONE]
