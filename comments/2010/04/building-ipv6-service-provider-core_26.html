            <div class="comment-content">Hum.. the last time i was participating in webex call i was able to change audio settings and increase the amount of voice buffering to improve the quality but to sacrifice a delay, which helped me to understand host more clearly (i was connected over poor wireless connection). The thing is.. i cannot remember exactly where i found that setting.. I joined the webex demo just now to find it, but the mentioned parameter is not among the settings I&#39;m able to set. I believe it is so due to the settings of the session. Also searched through webex docs site but i wasn&#39;t able to find any info about buffer settings. <br />So in general that could be done on the client site to improve audio, but it looks like i&#39;ll have to wait for another webex session to be able to report where to find that particular setting.</div>
