  html: Hi there,<br /><br />Long time reader but first time poster.  I&#39;m a bit
    of a novice and thought I&#39;d take a stab at this.  Could you apply a route-map
    to each of the interfaces on the LNS router with no match statement, and make
    it set the exit interface to the opposite interface?  You wouldn&#39;t need to
    know any addresses, just interfaces.<br /><br />Ian.

  html: You could set the default route on the LNS pointing towards the LACs and forward
    all traffic coming with a branch source ip address to the next-hop of the core
    router by using policy routing

  html: Option 1) use PBR on the virtual-template interface with set ip default next-hop
    pointing to the internal router or<br />Option 2) put the inside interface and
    virtual-template in a VRF or<br />Option 3) ask the SP if they can announce their
    LAC IP addresses with BGP so that we do not need a static default route for reaching
    the LACs<br /><br />I prefer option 1

  html: 'Hi! I don&#39;t use L2TP in my network but I have somewhat similar setup
    with DMVPN, where SP provides IP connectivity from spokes to hub within SP&#39;s
    network and Internet access is being router centrally via a firewall. I was posed
    with the same question, which way the default route should be pointed, since spokes&#39;
    addresses are dynamic. <br />So I resolved this with the following configuration
    at hub:<br />crypto dynamic-map [SP-DMVPN map name] 10<br /> set transform-set
    [DMVPN TS name]<br /> reverse-route remote-peer [next hop at SP&#39;s side] gateway<br
    />interface GigabitEthernet0/0.2<br /> description SP tunnel termination<br />
    ip address [SP provided address]<br /> service-policy output [SP-DMVPN map name]<br
    />0/0 route is being received by this router via OSPF and points to the campus
    core network.<br /><br />Now when spokes dynamically establish IPSec with hub,
    crypto subsystem adds static routes pointing to their Internet IPs via hub&#39;s
    SP-facing interface:<br /><br />tunnelhub#sh crypto route<br /><br />VPN Routing
    Table: Shows RRI and VTI created routes<br />Codes: RRI - Reverse-Route, VTI-
    Virtual Tunnel Interface<br />        S - Static Map ACLs<br /><br />Routes created
    in table GLOBAL DEFAULT<br />[spoke SP IP]/255.255.255.255 [1/0] via [hub SP nexthop]
    tag 0<br />                                on GigabitEthernet0/0.2 RRI<br /><br
    />I&#39;m really not sure if this is applicable for L2TP, anyway, maybe someone
    would find this hint useful.'

  html: I would look into establishing a separate VRF for the internal interfaces
    of the LNS router, specifically the internal Ethernet interface and the Virtual-Template
    interface.<br /><br />One could also put the external interface in a VRF, but
    that is more complex and may not be supported in PPPoE/L2TP.  (I do know for a
    fact it is supported in recent versions of IOS&#39; IPsec implementation.)<br
    /><br />Not having worked with PPPoE/L2TP, I couldn&#39;t tell you without research
    whether VRF-based separation would work.

  html: You can put the vpdn-group in vrf by using vpn command inside it and the interface
    of the LAC in that VRF<br />Then you can route the default of the L2TP to the
    LAC inside the VRF  and to the LAN outside the VRF

  html: I think asking the provider which LAC addresses they use would be the easiest
    way.<br />Otherwise maybe some kind of an &quot;outside LNS&quot; (located in
    the internet) could be depolyed which accepts the sessions forwarded by the ISP&#39;s
    LAC and forwards them once again to an &quot;inside LNS&quot; (which is the already
    existing ISDN hub-router).

  html: Hi Ivan, where you get those cool routers, clouds, etc. symbols, icons or
    how you name it? <br />Hidden Cisco icon packet? <br />Software?
