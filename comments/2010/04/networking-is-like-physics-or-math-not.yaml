  html: Sorry, networking is not even close to any science. It is not even high-tech
    engineering. Its approach and methodology is more like those of plumbing.

  html: I can&#39;t disagree with you ... however, I wanted to emphasize the need
    to build an understanding of what&#39;s going on and what different technologies
    do (and don&#39;t do) versus jumping head-on into configuration stuff.

  html: As Narbik Kocharians says in his classes &quot;every command has as story.&quot;
    Great reminder of that on this post Ivan. You understand the story you&#39;ll
    know what to configure.

  html: I think that&#39;s true of becoming good at networking, in a general sense.
    The problem with certification exams, however, is that they are often written
    to cater to this memorization model (at least good portions of many exams). <br
    /><br />For example, the only way that I know an ASA can perform NAT and PAT on
    SIP inspection traffic, but cannot PAT on LDAP inspection traffic, is via memorization.
    Cisco tests are filled with that sort of insanity. I think the general concept
    exams are not as bad, but the exams on certain products (e.g., ASA, IPS, etc)
    require lots of memorization because no one has the specific experience these
    exams require (I&#39;ve never tried to perform PAT on LDAP only to discover it
    didn&#39;t work, nor have I tried to NAT SIP to see if it worked).

  html: Isn&#39;t plumbing the practical application of a science?

  html: Certification -should be- like physics and sience, but [often] is like history.<br
    /><br />This is done to give absolute beginners a change to pass the exams, this
    is why I could not care less about particular certified people when they can&#39;t
    answer simple logic-questions.

  html: Great explanation, I definitely agree! Every time I study a new topic it really
    helps to know the history behind it and how it evolved during the years, BGP is
    a great example of it.

  html: Understanding networking and passing a certification test are two different
    things. One &quot;can&quot; lead to the other but, they aren&#39;t the same. Understanding
    networking fundamentals and theory, is actually closer to math or a science...BUT
    unfortunately passing a Cisco Exam is like history. Its more based on memorizing
    obscure timers, and obscure pieces of information.
