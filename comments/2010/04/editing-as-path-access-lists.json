      "html": "I think such mechanism doesn&#39;t exist in Cisco IOS. But it is not necessary. In case of ACL on interface traffic flow continuously. If we remove ACL - it will be a disaster. As-path access-list works only when there is a change somewhere in BGP table. So it is not terrible to remove it and then to paste new one with the same number. At least it works pretty well with small as-path ACLs.  ;) As concerns long as-pasth ACLs and huge BGP tables... What is the real task? In most cases, I think, you have to avoid as-path ACLs (see previous comment) and use communities (if it is possible :) ) or a script that will query whois databases and bogon route-servers to compile incredible long ip prefix-lists.",

      "html": "I&#39;m generating and uploading BGP filters automatically from a NMS. The best way to construct BGP filters (as-path based or prefix-list based) is to query RADB, since RADB mirrors all other routing registry databases. RADB also provides a nice mechanism to expand customer as-sets recursively:<br /><br />whois -h whois.radb.net \\!iAS-SET,1<br /><br />From that one constructing the as-path acl is easy - you can use even an one-liner like this:<br /><br />whois -h whois.radb.net \\!iAS-SET,1 | head -2 | tail -1 | fmt - 70 | tr &#39;[as]&#39; &#39;[AS]&#39; | fmt -50 | \\<br />sed -e &#39;s/AS/|/g&#39; -e &#39;s/\\ //g&#39; -e &#39;s/$/\\)\\$/g&#39; -e &#39;s/^|/ip\\ as-path\\ access-list NNN\\ permit\\ \\_\\(/g&#39;",
