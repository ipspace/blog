  html: If I recall correctly, this feature of FTP is used by the GridFTP protocol,
    which various HPC scientific communities use; notably the high-energy physics
    lot.

  html: Yes, FXP is incredibly popular in pirate groups.  Large FTP servers generally
    have huge amounts of bandwidth and being able to spread a release between two
    servers is generally quicker than transferring it down your consumer ADSL and
    then back up to the second server.
