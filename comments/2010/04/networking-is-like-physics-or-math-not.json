      "html": "I think that&#39;s true of becoming good at networking, in a general sense. The problem with certification exams, however, is that they are often written to cater to this memorization model (at least good portions of many exams). <br /><br />For example, the only way that I know an ASA can perform NAT and PAT on SIP inspection traffic, but cannot PAT on LDAP inspection traffic, is via memorization. Cisco tests are filled with that sort of insanity. I think the general concept exams are not as bad, but the exams on certain products (e.g., ASA, IPS, etc) require lots of memorization because no one has the specific experience these exams require (I&#39;ve never tried to perform PAT on LDAP only to discover it didn&#39;t work, nor have I tried to NAT SIP to see if it worked).",
