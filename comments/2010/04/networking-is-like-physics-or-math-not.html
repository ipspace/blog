            <div class="comment-content">Sorry, networking is not even close to any science. It is not even high-tech engineering. Its approach and methodology is more like those of plumbing.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I can&#39;t disagree with you ... however, I wanted to emphasize the need to build an understanding of what&#39;s going on and what different technologies do (and don&#39;t do) versus jumping head-on into configuration stuff.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I think that&#39;s true of becoming good at networking, in a general sense. The problem with certification exams, however, is that they are often written to cater to this memorization model (at least good portions of many exams). <br /><br />For example, the only way that I know an ASA can perform NAT and PAT on SIP inspection traffic, but cannot PAT on LDAP inspection traffic, is via memorization. Cisco tests are filled with that sort of insanity. I think the general concept exams are not as bad, but the exams on certain products (e.g., ASA, IPS, etc) require lots of memorization because no one has the specific experience these exams require (I&#39;ve never tried to perform PAT on LDAP only to discover it didn&#39;t work, nor have I tried to NAT SIP to see if it worked).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Certification -should be- like physics and sience, but [often] is like history.<br /><br />This is done to give absolute beginners a change to pass the exams, this is why I could not care less about particular certified people when they can&#39;t answer simple logic-questions.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Understanding networking and passing a certification test are two different things. One &quot;can&quot; lead to the other but, they aren&#39;t the same. Understanding networking fundamentals and theory, is actually closer to math or a science...BUT unfortunately passing a Cisco Exam is like history. Its more based on memorizing obscure timers, and obscure pieces of information.</div>
