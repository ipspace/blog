Picking routes and creating separate RIBs, (AKA Juniper does this -- not sure about the RIB though). This could be useful in some MPLS VPN scenarios and such.. just a rant :) (not really my idea, but it&#39;s cool)",

I have a C6513 dual-homed to a single AS. When I do &quot;sh ip bgp 4.2.2.2&quot; I see two Paths. When I do &quot;sh ip cef 4.2.2.2 detail&quot; or &quot;sh ip route 4.2.2.2&quot; I see only one Path which seems normal.<br />If the FIB had multiple Paths/next-hops/interfaces for a single prefix - wouldn&#39;t that require process switching and defeat the purpose?<br /><br />Oh and Thank You very much for sharing all of this great information!",
