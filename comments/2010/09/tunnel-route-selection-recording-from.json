      "html": "In the scenario with a DMVPN built over the Internet and the need for redundancy, in the past I have used the Front-Door VRF DMVPN feature, with the Internet interface in the front-door VRF.  This will only work if you are full tunneling Internet traffic from spokes to hub sites, but it solved the issue of having to have 2 different default routes for Internet and one for tunneled traffic quite nicely.",
