  html: 'I always wander: why not just aggregate prefixes locally before installing
    to FIB? CEF and similar technologies are highly optimized and structured constructions
    that should be easily used for aggregating prefixes, especially for small-middle
    operators on the edge routers with very few next-hops. Really big part of internet
    is aggregates announced as specifics (for different purposes), but for most of
    distant AS-es they point to just one upstream. And you can always leave holes
    in aggregations as specifics. Dirty approach for that concept is just cut full-table
    to /23 or 22-21 for old router and point 0/0 to big and powerful core (with mpls)-
    we did that about 8 yeas ago and there was really small amount of suboptimal routing
    inside our AS.'

  html: You just described another great idea. In most cases, it&#39;s more than enough
    to have full routing in the core and default routing on the edge (more so if you&#39;re
    not providing generic transit), but most people don&#39;t get it and think they
    will get suboptimal routing because they might send the traffic toward a /24 in
    Elbonia in the wrong direction.<br /><br />The next problem are the BGP customers
    - they want full feed (maybe they bought too much RAM and/or care about Elbonia)
    and you either have full BGP table on the access router or use multihop EBGP into
    your core (in which case you have support problems with some customers)

  html: For cisco gear there is not much devices with plenty of RAM that can handle
    full-table and have very limited amount of TCAM, i can only remember some of cats
    4500 and non-XL versions of 6500. So, FIB-only optimization is nice to have, but
    not enough in most cases. Also, it should greatly improve time of convergence
    in some situations (when prefix independent convergence is not available).

  html: Nexus 7000 ... but it doesn&#39;t support MPLS (yet).

  html: Nexus 7K seems to have full table support with the newer XL cards....  I haven&#39;t
    heard of anyone using them yet but they are advertising it for service providers/internet
    exchange points.<br /><br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps9441/ps9402/data_sheet_c78-574928.html
