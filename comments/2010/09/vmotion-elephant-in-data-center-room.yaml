  html: I&#39;m glad I work somewhere that pushes developers to make apps that don&#39;t
    need to rely on this type of Tomfoolery.  IMHO, vMotion is the kind of thing where
    a hypervisor company sees its product start to commoditize and looks for ways
    to keep an edge. Just because one can migrate their running VM from one machine
    to another does not mean that is the best way to run a server.

  html: Nice post - 2 questions for you:<br />1) Do you believe that Hyper-v&#39;s
    Live Migration is up to par with vMotion? (I don&#39;t believe so)<br />2) Thoughts
    on Cisco&#39;s OTV to extend L2 between datacenters (and especially with vMotion)

  html: '#1: I have no experience with Hyper-V, so trust your judgement ;)<br /><br
    />#2: If you have to do long-distance bridging over IP, OTV is currently the best
    available technology. <br /><br />However, in my opinion long-distance bridging
    makes little sense (more so when coupled with vMotion) and you should try to avoid
    it as much as possible.'

  html: Ivan,<br /><br />This is one of my favorite unmentioned technology shortcomings
    today. If you have ever sat in a meeting with Cisco and server folks regarding
    the Nexus, OTV, and VM mobility, you will see their eyes light up while the networking
    folks shake their head.<br /><br />One pie-in-the-sky solution for this was mentioned
    by Dino F. as a use case in part three of his Google tech talk regarding LISP
    (around 30:05):<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxdm-Xouu-k<br /><br
    />While this would require a newly designed FHRP and a signaling mechanism between
    a VM and the network, it is interesting nonetheless. :)

  html: Hi Ivan,<br />Sorry, but I think you meant &quot;first-hop redundancy protocol
    (FHRP) like HSRP or GLBP&quot; and not NHRP, or I don&#39;t know something interesting
    about NHRP  :)

  html: 'Here&#39;s the description of impacts of long-distance vMotion:<br /><br
    />http://blog.ioshints.info/2010/09/long-distance-vmotion-and-traffic.html<br
    /><br />As for long-distance bridging itself: each bridged VLAN is a single broadcast
    and security domain, which makes scaling pretty hard and prone to failures.<br

  html: Steve, Ivan,<br /><br />I actually got VM Mobility to work in my lab, and
    didn&#39;t need any changes inside the VM or the network when moving machines
    around. <br /><br />So, LISP is good for you :-)
