IMHO, vMotion is the kind of thing where a hypervisor company sees its product start to commoditize and looks for ways to keep an edge. Just because one can migrate their running VM from one machine to another does not mean that is the best way to run a server.",

If you have ever sat in a meeting with Cisco and server folks regarding the Nexus, OTV, and VM mobility, you will see their eyes light up while the networking folks shake their head.<br /><br />One pie-in-the-sky solution for this was mentioned by Dino F. as a use case in part three of his Google tech talk regarding LISP (around 30:05):<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxdm-Xouu-k<br /><br />While this would require a newly designed FHRP and a signaling mechanism between a VM and the network, it is interesting nonetheless. :)",
