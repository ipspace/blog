  html: The code is available. Testing - no time @ the moment. Working on an IPv6
    strategy paper ;)

  html: LISP will die away like SHIM6, it is not a real solution. The real solution
    is turning on IPv6.

  html: Turning on IPv6 will not save you from the routing table explosion. LISP might.

  html: As long as we stick with hierarchical addressing and routing, the problems
    of multihoming and suboptimal routing will remain there :D Making EID address-space
    non-hierarchical might have solved the problem but non-hierarchical protocols
    have their own drawbacks. <br /><br />Since LISP-ALT uses IPv4 in EID space, it
    has to enforce strict aggregation to prevent the same explosion problems we have
    now with IPv4/IPv6 addressing. While this does not affect multihoming (due to
    RLOC/EID split), it definitely makes operations more difficult as advanced coordination
    is required to properly allocate address space and enforce aggregation.

  html: Don&#39;t worry, EID will explode. You will see host routes in EID ... but
    who cares; it&#39;s all in the control plane, where you can throw low-cost CPU
    cycles and low-cost dynamic RAM (on Moore&#39;s Law curve) at the problem. <br
    /><br />LISP solves just the problem of the core routers&#39; TCAM explosion,
    nothing else.

  html: Not exactly sure how one can grow control plane state in a single device without
    increasing the forwarind state. Of course, forwarding table aggregation could
    be used to some extent, but that&#39;s a hack, not a solution. LIST-ALT pushes
    the forwarding state explosiong problem to the edge (just like the BGP-free core)
    but does eliminate the root cause - hierarchical addressing/routing. It could
    be so that in the future we&#39;ll face TCAM exhaustion in the EID space.<br /><br
    />However, to me, the forwarding state problem has been highly exagerrated :)
    After all, TCAM exhaustion was a good driver for buying new hardware and hence
    made sense for everyone (vendors making new equipment, SPs growring budgest and
    shifting costs to their customers, etc)

  html: Edge devices will use caching. Yeah, I know, every caching-based forwarding
    mechanism has failed.<br /><br />Facebook&#39;s or Google&#39;s edge devices will
    have &quot;interesting&quot; forwarding caches  :-P<br /><br />BTW, you cannot
    defragment EID space. Each /24 (today) or /64 (tomorrow) that wants to be multihomed
    needs a dedicated entry with two RLOCs.
