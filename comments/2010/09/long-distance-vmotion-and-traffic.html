            <div class="comment-content">Does VMware even support long distance vMotion?  I don&#39;t think they like to even like to admit that vMotion works between two ESX servers on different subnets.  :)  I believe things are going that way, but it is still pretty messy and there are lots of caveats and design considerations.  If I remember right, EMC has been discussing a setup with VPLEX that uses synchronous replication on the storage side (block) so that traffic can be localized even when vMotioning between two sites (distance limited for the synchronous part).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">DING!!! Your answer is correct.<br /><br />However, the current routing protocols are too slow (the convergence would take a few seconds unless you want to tweak OSPF really badly) and we lack a mechanism to detect host movement reliably - we would need L3 functionality in the vSwitch or some other registration mechanism.<br /><br />Obviously there&#39;s no L3 switching in the vSwitch or NX1K and even if it would be there, it would eat CPU cycles as it would have to participate in the routing protocol.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Back to the good old LAM days? :) I just want to stress out that OSPF/ISIS could be *easily* tuned to converge within 10s or 100s of milliseconds without impacting network stability, provided that network links are point-to-point and support fast failure detection. Sub-second IGP convergence has been heavily studied and experimented with since late 90s and it is actually a regular practice in cases where you want fast convergence without the complexity of link/node protection (plus IP FRR could be deployed in addition to IGP re-routing). The deployment scale was as large as up to thousand devices in producton, so there are no inherent limitations in IGP convergence (though moving to a better dynamic SPF might be a nice improvement). <br /><br />All other migration factor are subject to discussion, with management and control plane overhead being among the main show-stoppers.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Yup, I&#39;ve discussed the option of using LAM for this kind of thing. The main problem with it is that there&#39;s zero VRF support. If vendors redeveloped it and implemented VRF-awareness then there could be done mileage in it.</div>
