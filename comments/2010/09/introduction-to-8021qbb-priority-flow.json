I&#39;ve been trying to track down everything out there on the topic between the time I posted the comment and now.<br /><br />Found a blog reference stating that multiple storage vendors recommend using 802.3x mode desired on the switch side (Flow control RX only).  Really couldn&#39;t find much even from the storage vendors themselves on the topic.  But it sounds reasonable enough that I should only need to be able to process inbound PAUSE frames.  <br /><br />I&#39;m investigating QCN now as my logical next step.  Not sure if a leaf spine layout where the switch &#39;hops&#39; is an architecture that would benefit from QCN, but it almost sees impossible that it would even be implemented where there are more switch hops.  I&#39;m in a place where even my vendor documentation doesn&#39;t seem reliable regarding QCN (One white paper states support for QCN, another white paper for the same switch only mentions ECN). Hehe - It seems for every answer I find I come up with few more questions.  Especially around converged iSCSI implementations.  Lots on FCoE but not many are willing to give authoritative recommendations on converged iSCSI. <br /><br />I guess I really have to bite the bullet and start reading RFC3720 to my kids at bed time.<br /><br />Sorry for the rant - thanks for the response.<br /><br />-Gabe",

Just to report back in.. my sort of my in-depth exploration of DCB and iSCSI pretty much ended with a senior colleague (who happened to be deeply involved with DCB in the lab during the FCoE push 2 years ago) was explaining to me that while PFC sounds hands down better than 802.3x FC, the big benefit comes from deploying it alongside ETC... and ETC along with PFC need to be negotiated end to end [Host &lt;-&gt; Switch &lt;-&gt; Storage] and well.. PFC might as well be no-existent from the storage perspective.  In any case your articles have been beyond educational. <br /><br />Thanks for all the great feedback.
