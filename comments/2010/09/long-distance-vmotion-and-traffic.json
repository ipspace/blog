      "html": "Does VMware even support long distance vMotion?  I don&#39;t think they like to even like to admit that vMotion works between two ESX servers on different subnets.  :)  I believe things are going that way, but it is still pretty messy and there are lots of caveats and design considerations.  If I remember right, EMC has been discussing a setup with VPLEX that uses synchronous replication on the storage side (block) so that traffic can be localized even when vMotioning between two sites (distance limited for the synchronous part).",

      "html": "DING!!! Your answer is correct.<br /><br />However, the current routing protocols are too slow (the convergence would take a few seconds unless you want to tweak OSPF really badly) and we lack a mechanism to detect host movement reliably - we would need L3 functionality in the vSwitch or some other registration mechanism.<br /><br />Obviously there&#39;s no L3 switching in the vSwitch or NX1K and even if it would be there, it would eat CPU cycles as it would have to participate in the routing protocol.",

      "html": "Back to the good old LAM days? :) I just want to stress out that OSPF/ISIS could be *easily* tuned to converge within 10s or 100s of milliseconds without impacting network stability, provided that network links are point-to-point and support fast failure detection. Sub-second IGP convergence has been heavily studied and experimented with since late 90s and it is actually a regular practice in cases where you want fast convergence without the complexity of link/node protection (plus IP FRR could be deployed in addition to IGP re-routing). The deployment scale was as large as up to thousand devices in producton, so there are no inherent limitations in IGP convergence (though moving to a better dynamic SPF might be a nice improvement). <br /><br />All other migration factor are subject to discussion, with management and control plane overhead being among the main show-stoppers.",
