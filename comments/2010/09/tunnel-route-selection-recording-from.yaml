  html: In the scenario with a DMVPN built over the Internet and the need for redundancy,
    in the past I have used the Front-Door VRF DMVPN feature, with the Internet interface
    in the front-door VRF.  This will only work if you are full tunneling Internet
    traffic from spokes to hub sites, but it solved the issue of having to have 2
    different default routes for Internet and one for tunneled traffic quite nicely.

  html: Front-door VRF works nicely if you have the spoke site with link to one ISP
    (or two ISPs that don&#39;t do RPF check). If you have two uplinks to two ISPs,
    you have to use two VRFs (or tunnel route selection if you use two MPLS/VPN services
    and don&#39;t need IPSec).

  html: we use a vrf per ISP each with a different default route in each, and a 3rd
    default route in the global table for traffic going through the tunnels
