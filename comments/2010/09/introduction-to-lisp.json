      "html": "As long as we stick with hierarchical addressing and routing, the problems of multihoming and suboptimal routing will remain there :D Making EID address-space non-hierarchical might have solved the problem but non-hierarchical protocols have their own drawbacks. <br /><br />Since LISP-ALT uses IPv4 in EID space, it has to enforce strict aggregation to prevent the same explosion problems we have now with IPv4/IPv6 addressing. While this does not affect multihoming (due to RLOC/EID split), it definitely makes operations more difficult as advanced coordination is required to properly allocate address space and enforce aggregation.",

      "html": "Not exactly sure how one can grow control plane state in a single device without increasing the forwarind state. Of course, forwarding table aggregation could be used to some extent, but that&#39;s a hack, not a solution. LIST-ALT pushes the forwarding state explosiong problem to the edge (just like the BGP-free core) but does eliminate the root cause - hierarchical addressing/routing. It could be so that in the future we&#39;ll face TCAM exhaustion in the EID space.<br /><br />However, to me, the forwarding state problem has been highly exagerrated :) After all, TCAM exhaustion was a good driver for buying new hardware and hence made sense for everyone (vendors making new equipment, SPs growring budgest and shifting costs to their customers, etc)",
