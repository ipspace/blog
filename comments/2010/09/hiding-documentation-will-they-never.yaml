  html: Ugh, I hate that. Of course, Arista is certainly not without company.<br /><br
    />Thank you again for the excellent talk, Doug. And I&#39;ll second Ivan&#39;s
    plea. :)

  html: AFAIK, Juniper always had their documentation in the open. But then again,
    for a very long time their stance was &quot;we are everything Cisco isn&#39;t&quot;
    ;)

  html: Not everything that Juniper does can be categorized like this. Juniper genuinely
    thinks different without regard to Cisco.

  html: In this particular case, they obviously followed Cisco&#39;s good practices
    ;)<br /><br />As Andres said, Juniper does what they think is best.

  html: Let&#39;s be serious, they are probably hiding the documentation so Cisco
    does not get hold of it and use it to pick their products apart.

  html: You can buy their gear online, directly from their web site. How hard would
    it be for a competitor to use a dummy company and buy a few boxes? <br /><br />Wake
    up to reality. Hiding documentation will never stop your competitors, it will
    only hurt your sales.

  html: AFAIR, Huawei has guest-level accounts that can access most of the docs. At
    least in Datacom product line.<br /><br />Quick check says that datacom section
    is now open (mostly, no software, no doc cd bundles) even without registration.
