Nonetheless, non-unique keyword is a good trick. And as u mentioned, it will still stuff up IPSec and routing.",

On the other hand, ADSL (PPPoE) connections for an enterprise spoke site (although inexpensive) is not very common compared to SHDSL which are a norm and have static IPs. DMVPN connections on the latter are heard of. :-D",

Just figured it out after reading Ivan&#39;s post of  <br />http://blog.ioshints.info/2007/06/dhcp-response-sets-default-route.html  <br />IOS dhcp client will have a default route to the default gateway provided by dhcp server.  <br /> <br />Amazingly, this behavior is still true even you are using a front vrf which you put the WAN interface to a vrf and make it as dhcp client also. It will  install a default route to the default gateway in the vrf RT. I just tested it in a CISCO ISR 881 spoke and CISCO ISR 871 as hub. All are good and working as expected.",
