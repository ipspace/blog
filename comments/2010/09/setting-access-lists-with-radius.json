      "html": "Incidentally, if you apply an ACL to a virtual-template, it will _immediately_ trump the one(s) passed down by radius during PPP negotiation.  I assume it simply applies them sequentially, as you said.  <br /><br />So what I did was define an empty ACL, apply it to my radius accounts then wait two weeks to ensure all PPP sessions had that ACL installed.  Then I simply added lines to the middle of my ACL.<br /><br />Now we can hand down ACLs (and hopefully soon vrf configs) from our CMS (Platypus).  Thanks also to rancid for making the addition and maintenance of those ACLs much easier.",
