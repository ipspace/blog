            <div class="comment-content">You&#39;ve got it all wrong. UCS is not my favorite toy. I have never seen or touched one; I just happen to understand its architecture and the underlying design goals.<br /><br />As I said, I&#39;m positive all vendor-financed &quot;independent&quot; &quot;competitive&quot; tests are (by design) biased enough to be useless; I just happen to understand what this particular vaporware was all about.<br /><br />Also, if you had been reading my blog, you&#39;d have realized I happily bash Cisco (for example, due to the lack of IPv6 support in Data Center).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ok, you may be right on technical things like they didn&#39;t used right methodology.<br /><br />But when I first saw that report in headlines, I thought &quot;Hmmm, this will really upset cisco guys!&quot; (and I must admit, I haven&#39;t read that report), and what a surprise, you were one who reacted angrily (we call it like a hit goose).<br /><br />As an independent reporter, I would expect you react like &quot;Hmm, interesting results, but they use wrong methodology...&quot;</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Well, you haven&#39;t seen me reacting angrily yet ;) ... and I&#39;m not an &quot;independent reporter&quot; but an old extroverted opinionated GONER 8-)<br /><br />You&#39;ve also missed the point; it&#39;s never been the question of &quot;methodology&quot; (I could argue individual techical points if that would be the case), it&#39;s the question of whether the test setup makes any sense in the real life or whether it&#39;s totally irrelevant to what we use outside of ivory towers (ehmm ... labs) and was designed only to prove that one architecture is better tailored to the test than another.<br /><br />I had to endure these stunts (sponsored by every imaginable vendor) since these &quot;independent testers&quot; entered the industry (looking at their web site, I&#39;m working with routers longer than they were running their tests) and while I managed to ignore them during the last few years, the latest one reminded me of my past grudges  :-E</div>
