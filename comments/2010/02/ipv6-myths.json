Dynamic NAT (aka PAT, aka overloaded NAT, aka multiplexing multiple conversations onto a single layer 3 address using layer 4 port translations) provides some degree of security because it has the side effect of creating state. You will need to run a simple stateful firewall in front of IPv6 clients to get the same effect. This is not a hard problem. Stateful firewalls have no place in front of servers in the first place; owners of IPv6 server farms will need to ensure that their vendor supports stateless ACLs in hardware for IPv6 just like they do for IPv4.",
