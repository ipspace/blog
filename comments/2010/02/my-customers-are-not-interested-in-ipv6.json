Most SPs&#39; major customers are the home-users (broadband users). SPs should start assigning IPv6 addresses to these customers. <br /><br />Jeff Doyle on his blog has explained a great upcoming technology called Dual-stack lite where the end-users continue to use IPv4 addresses(private addresses) but their CPE tunnels IPv4 packets into IPv6 packets to the SP network where these packets are decapsulated and NAT (private IPv4 to public IPv4) is done. Hence, the end-users need not upgrade anything while the SP can install a Dual-stack Lite compatible CPE and perform NAT at the SP-end.<br /><br />However, I think the best would be to just move away to all-IPv6 network rather than getting into the mess of NAT. So the best way to convince the customers is to just bluntly tell them &quot;You will become obsolete eventually&quot;. =-X",
