By special -- justified -- request, yes, but it should never be the default.<br /><br />On the other hand, however, I&#39;d be wary of giving out anything smaller than a /64, as that&#39;s the size required for autoconfiguration to work (working on the basis that sensible CPE will run some kind of route-advertisement service for the prefix). If DHCPv6 ever becomes prevalent, this might change, but I wouldn&#39;t want to rely on that any time in the next few years.",

No need to segment further than that, and in fact, things break when you do, as Ivan has pointed out in previous blogs.<br /><br />We should assume that residential users will want to have more than one LAN in the future. Especially in the sense that service providers will want to offer triple-play type services over the same link and CPE device. Home automation networks, guest wireless networks, etc. These are all things being done today, and who knows what might come in the future.<br /><br />A /48 allows for plenty of future uses, and it&#39;s not that much of a stretch for providers to be assigning them a /48. At the bare minimum, give them a /56, which gives them 256 /64&#39;s to work with. Things like DHCP6-PD will make this really easy.",

If a router is connected a shorter prefix length must be used. It is convenient for the purpose of reverse delegation that this is on a nibble boundary.

If you delegate a /48 to the ISP-facing CPE, it can then delegate (for instance) a /56 to each routing device connected to it, and each of those devices can have multiple interfaces and possibly more devices behind them.<br /><br />The 8 bit boundary (/48 to /56) is arbitrary, it could as easily be 4, 5, or 6 bits. The point is that with 16 bits to work with, you can have a lot of flexibility in delegation, allowing for both plenty of levels of depth and plenty of devices at each level, but with only 8 bits those tradeoffs become much more acute. So, without a pressing reason to assign less than a /48, just use /48.",

I assume, really big networks will be multihomed anyway and will need to have their own IP range - the regional registrar will decide how big the range gets.<br />The multihoming topic is an interesting topic. I don&#39;t think that using more than one prefix on your hosts (one from each upstream provider) is a valuable solution. This leads either to NAT66 or own IP range (usually /48). I really don&#39;t want to implement NAT for multihoming and using provider independent address space leads to a big routing table.<br /><br />/48 for customers makes complete sense. It&#39;s easy to understand, the customer can use /56 for his subnetworks and /64 for his segments. Service Provider wise, you&#39;ll only have /48 and /64 networks (and /128 for loopbacks) in your own routing table. Pretty neat. Makes the subnet calculation easier ;)",
