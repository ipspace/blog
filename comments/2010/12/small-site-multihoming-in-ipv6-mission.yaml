    /><br />You can get around the sending traffic out the wrong link using policy
    based routing (route on the source address). You have to depend on the host being
    able to choose a working SA/DA pair, which really requires Happy Eyeballs. http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wing-v6ops-happy-eyeballs-ipv6-01<br
    /><br />There are alternatives: SHIM6, LISP, ILNP, NAT66...'

  html: '@Ivan, why didnt you mention LISP? :-(<br /><br />Multihoming a v6 site without
    PI space &amp; BGP is easy peasy with LISP. You get 2 uplinks to whatever provider
    with whatever means, and the CPE will tell the mapping system where it&#39;s /48
    (or /56 or whatever) is located. That&#39;s it, just 9 lines of configuration.
    <br /><br />This is real and working at this very moment.'

  html: No doubt that you have it working (I know I need to do the same ;), but will
    it scale if we suddenly get millions of entries on top of what&#39;s already there?

  html: LISP multi-homing works best if everyone else is also using LISP... Slight
    deployment problem.

  html: '@Ole, <br /><br />Not true, LISP was designed with incremental deployment
    in mind. Multi-homing works fine the moment you configure two proxy-routers and
    have 2 uplinks. That&#39;s all.'

  html: '@Ivan<br /><br />Exactly! I still cannot ping you over LISP...<br /><br />The
    short version: Yes, LISP is being developed explicitly to address the scaling
    issues we face today and in a few years. Maintaining state in RAM is cheap. There
    can be many many  EID prefixes - and with LISP they can be aggregated heavily.The
    RLOC space (the current internet) is a mess anyway, LISP hopes to slow down the
    growth of the routing table.'

  html: 'The problem with multihoming is the fact that IPv4/IPv6 paths are calculated
    to the points of attachment, not end-nodes themselves. This effectively makes
    any additional layer of indirection such as LISP, unscalable, as decoupling locations
    from IDs brings the problem of validating the path liveness. Taking LISP-ALT architecture,
    we may notice that due to high aggregation and logical separation from the RLOC
    topology the destination EID would always be reported as reachable. Furthermore,
    the use of edge-aggregated (PA) space for RLOCs will also hide network failures
    at RLOC layer. Thus, every ITR has to probe every EID-&gt;RLOC mapping for liveness
    as the responding ETR has no idea whether the particular path is reachable from
    querying ITR. This problem is described in depth in: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-meyer-loc-id-implications-01
    . This document also lists the site synchronization problem, which is a direct
    result of the &quot;caching&quot; and existence of multiple ingress/egress points
    for every LISP site.<br /><br />Adding another encapsulation layer is a serious
    architectural move with major implications. As I mentioned previously, LISP edge
    nodes are unware of the underlying RLOC topology (think of layer of indirection).  Every
    LISP site advertises mappings to ingress entry point being unware of the paths
    to these points. This results in the fact that traffic load-balancing that is
    optimum from the edge-site perspective may appear suboptimal from the underlying
    Internet perspective. In other words, the traffic matrix that LISP sites require
    may not fit well to the underlying Internet topology. Comparing this to single-ISP
    networks and MPLS/BGP VPNs you may notice that MPLS TE or IGP TE could be used
    to optimize the &quot;tunneled&quot; traffic flows. However, there is no common
    traffic engineering scheme for the Internet.<br /><br />Another problem from the
    set is the statement that RLOC space is poorly aggregatable because of PIs. This
    is not the only reason. Optimum aggregation requires the network topology to be
    hierarchical, which is not the case of the Internet, which is more of a self-similar
    graph. Internet is only hierarchical at the edge, where provider aggregation could
    be implemented. However, aggregating addresses in such topologies globally is
    not possible for hierarchial routing.<br /><br />To summarize, effective multihoming
    and mobility require changing the IP routing and addressing architecture. If we
    continue to remain within the limitations of hierarchical addressing and PoA addressing
    we&#39;ll result in moving the problem from one part of the network to another,
    but will never get a scalable solution.'

  html: 'You don&#39;t need to wait for valid lifetime to expire, only preferred,
    and you can set that to zero immediately. Valid just means it won&#39;t tear down
    existing connections using that address; once it&#39;s deprecated (not preferred)
    no new connections will be sourced from that prefix. At least that&#39;s how it&#39;s
    supposed to work, feel free to report bugs.<br /><br />It&#39;s true that you
    don&#39;t get much control over which prefix your hosts use; there are some drafts
    in process to add this information to DHCPv6.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know about
    you, but I&#39;m pretty sure neither my home-office nor my local small business
    network satisfies the current ARIN reqs for new v6 allocations: have v4 space
    already (nope, using v4 NAT multihoming) or satisfy the v4 requirements (25% utilization
    now, 50% within a year of a /24 if multihomed -- 64 hosts now, 128 hosts in a
    year). If you have 128 hosts in your home office, color me impressed.'

  html: I have this problem today.  I have 5 Internet providers over 3 sites, and
    only two would do any BGP if I went that way.  I have a unique local address scheme
    ready to go, but I can&#39;t get any ipv6 from any of my providers today, even
    if there was NAT66.  <br /><br />So I do nothing, as I can&#39;t have unpredictable
    client function because if I went with my ULA scheme browsers would do weirdness
    with no outbound egress but getting external AAAA records from the outside dns
    recursive servers.  <br /><br />Not even getting into infrastructure with no IPv6
    support like WAAS, which my business relies on.  It&#39;s a mess and depressing.  <br
    /><br />Is it too late to go CLNS?
