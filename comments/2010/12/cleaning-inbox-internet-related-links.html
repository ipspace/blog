            <div class="comment-content">&quot;Google IPv6 statistics – 0.2% of Google’s traffic is IPv6. Did anyone notice we’re running out of IPv4 addresses?&quot;<br /><br />In order to access Google IPv6 it is not enough to be IPv6 capable. Google via IPv6 is only available for networks that are IPv6 only or dual-stack networks that have seperate IPv6 DNS servers and have filled out a form to request access for Google-IPv6.<br />(http://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/)<br /><br />So even if you have a dual-stack network, and perhaps with seperate DNS servers, you won&#39;t be able to access google via ipv6 until you fill out the request form. And how many admins will go through, or know about that process?<br /><br />With this in mind, is Google IPv6 statistics relevant?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">#1 - it&#39;s not the &quot;network admin&quot; that has to fill out the form, but the ISP admin (unless you have your own DNS and don&#39;t use the one from your ISP as a forwarder).<br /><br />#2 - Since most of the IPv6 traffic on the Internet is Google-related (more about that in an upcoming post), it&#39;s somewhat hard to fathom why an ISP would go to the pains of implementing dual-stack network and then neglect to fill in the Google form.<br /><br />#3 - even if the Google statistics are off by an order of magnitude, it&#39;s still only 2%.</div>
