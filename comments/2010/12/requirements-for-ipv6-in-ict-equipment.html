            <div class="comment-content">This is a really useful document - I&#39;m sure many of us have been caught out by vendors who claim IPv6 support but on further investigation have many feature gaps. My only criticism - I can&#39;t find any mention of DHCPv6 relay? I guess it&#39;s covered by DHCPv6 client / server [RFC3315]  but it seems like it might be useful to separate out as an entry of its own. In an enterprise environment relay to central servers is likely to be far more valuable than a server on the router.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Relaying is part of RFC 3315. Thanks for the feedback - if we ever get to v2, I&#39;ll make sure to have it explicitly spelled out. Anything else?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I would advocate that people start deploying IPv6 today. However, the business reality is that the &quot;problem&quot; can be delayed for another year or two and that is what will they will do. <br /><br />With the economic recession continuing, IPv6 is not a pressing issue right now. And virtualisation is getting all the oxygen in IT marketing right now.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hey,<br /><br />In January we will start working on 2nd version of that document. We also got Merike Kaeo aboard, so I suspect next version to be even more precise and useful. I suggest you subscribe to RIPE IPv6 WG mailinglist, as there will be much discussion on this (I presume), as we try to build this document on a solid consesus from RIPE technical community.<br /><br />BTW, glad to hear you find the doc useful :)<br /><br />thnx, /jan</div>
