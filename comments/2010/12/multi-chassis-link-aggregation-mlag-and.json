      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Very interesting insight. The MC-LAG implementation I&#39;ve been privy to (ALU TiMOS) does not use load balancing - you always have one or more active and one or more standby group members, with active members always being on the same physical chassis and standby being on the other. While this solution potentially has a disadvantage of not using all the available bandwidth (and yes, potentially using a sub-optimal path for some flows), it on the other hand has an advantage of simplicity (and thus being inherently more stable due to fewer things that could go wrong) and lack of the problem you&#39;re describing.",

      "html": "MB, when you spread etherchannel links across multiple members of a 3750 stack, that&#39;s what Cisco calls &quot;cross-stack etherchannel&quot;, which in my understanding is a very different animal from multi-chassis etherchannel. The way Cisco handles the frame-forwarding, what you&#39;ve really got in a 3750 stack is more like a single chassis with blades where the stacking cable forms the unified backplane, as opposed to multiple chassis&#39; doing special MLAG magic.<br /><br />Speaking to Ivan&#39;s example specifically, in a 3750 cross-stack etherchannel, I believe you would see a more balanced use of the cross-stack links. In other words, if servers A &amp; B are uplinked to the same 3750 switch in a stack, the stack would still use all members of the cross-stack etherchannel in accordance with the port-channel load-balancing algorithm you had selected.<br /><br />I&#39;ll admit this is based purely on my experience managing a couple of hundred 3750 stacks, where we relied on cross-stack etherchannel both for performance and resiliency. We saw good, load-balanced results across the links hashing on port numbers inbound from the agg/core layer, and on source/destination IP outbound from the stack (which doesn&#39;t support hashing on L4 port numbers). The load-balancing method appropriate for your stacks might vary depending on your layout.<br /><br />Someone who&#39;s dug deeper into 3750 control-plane logic will correct me if I&#39;m misunderstanding what&#39;s really going on there.",

      "html": "I use basically the setup you describe with 3750-E stacks; it works really well and I get a good balance of traffic between ports in the port channel. Ethan is correct in that it&#39;s a way different beast than MLAG at least from what I have read about MLAG. The 3750 stacks are essentially a single switch with a robust failure mode. They can&#39;t even do rolling upgrades (man I would kill for that feature on 3750). In either case, with only 2 gig-e links in the LAG your biggest setback will be fretting over theoretical problems that just don&#39;t really matter much in reality.",

Also the topology would remain loop-free as you continue to attach paired access switches in this manner to the core routing switch pair and so, although you would want to retain spanning tree &quot;just in case&quot;, spanning tree topology events could be effectively eliminated.",
