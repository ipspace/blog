      "html": "This is a really useful document - I&#39;m sure many of us have been caught out by vendors who claim IPv6 support but on further investigation have many feature gaps. My only criticism - I can&#39;t find any mention of DHCPv6 relay? I guess it&#39;s covered by DHCPv6 client / server [RFC3315]  but it seems like it might be useful to separate out as an entry of its own. In an enterprise environment relay to central servers is likely to be far more valuable than a server on the router.",

However, the business reality is that the &quot;problem&quot; can be delayed for another year or two and that is what will they will do. <br /><br />With the economic recession continuing, IPv6 is not a pressing issue right now. And virtualisation is getting all the oxygen in IT marketing right now.",

I suggest you subscribe to RIPE IPv6 WG mailinglist, as there will be much discussion on this (I presume), as we try to build this document on a solid consesus from RIPE technical community.<br /><br />BTW, glad to hear you find the doc useful :)<br /><br />thnx, /jan",
