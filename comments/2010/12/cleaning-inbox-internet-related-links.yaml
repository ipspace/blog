  html: "&quot;Google IPv6 statistics \u2013 0.2% of Google\u2019s traffic is IPv6.\
    \ Did anyone notice we\u2019re running out of IPv4 addresses?&quot;<br /><br />In\
    \ order to access Google IPv6 it is not enough to be IPv6 capable. Google via\
    \ IPv6 is only available for networks that are IPv6 only or dual-stack networks\
    \ that have seperate IPv6 DNS servers and have filled out a form to request access\
    \ for Google-IPv6.<br />(http://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/)<br /><br />So even\
    \ if you have a dual-stack network, and perhaps with seperate DNS servers, you\
    \ won&#39;t be able to access google via ipv6 until you fill out the request form.\
    \ And how many admins will go through, or know about that process?<br /><br />With\
    \ this in mind, is Google IPv6 statistics relevant?"

  html: '#1 - it&#39;s not the &quot;network admin&quot; that has to fill out the
    form, but the ISP admin (unless you have your own DNS and don&#39;t use the one
    from your ISP as a forwarder).<br /><br />#2 - Since most of the IPv6 traffic
    on the Internet is Google-related (more about that in an upcoming post), it&#39;s
    somewhat hard to fathom why an ISP would go to the pains of implementing dual-stack
    network and then neglect to fill in the Google form.<br /><br />#3 - even if the
    Google statistics are off by an order of magnitude, it&#39;s still only 2%.'
