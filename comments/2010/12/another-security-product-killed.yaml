  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Looking at the new CCNP Security it wasn &#39;t a big
    suprise although i am curious about the outlook on the security division. [cristal
    ball mode]It wouldn &#39;t suprise me if their ACE products will also get the
    status EOL after a takeover of F5.

  html: Well... all those products are bought by customers because they already have
    a 100% Cisco network.<br />The customers who are concerned by the technology and
    not the vendor have no deal with running all those &quot;road to die&quot; who
    are always a lap behind the other niche vendors.<br />MARS, ACE, WAAS, .. all
    are revamped products destined to the recycle bin.<br /><br />Cheers

  html: 'It&#39;s very simple: Cisco acquires a company, Cisco tries to sell the product,
    lack of focus makes for dismal sales, product starts losing market share, Cisco
    kills the product.'

  html: 'Cisco has published it&#39;s SIEM Ecosystem for customers migrating from
    MARS to other vendors&#39; solutions at the link below. CSM 4.x does offer some
    of the MARS features (i.e. it can gather logs from ASA and IPS), but it doesn&#39;t
    do correlation or support nearly as many devices as MARS did.<br /><br />SIEM
