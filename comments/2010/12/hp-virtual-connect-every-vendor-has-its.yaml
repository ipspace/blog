  html: I know it&#39;s been mentioned before, but the open book approach that Cisco
    has taken with regards to its documentation is one of their critical keys to success.
    I&#39;ve always appreciated that, while they have plenty of marketing whitepapers
    and such fluff, I can drill down to config manuals, tech notes, and design guides
    quite easily.

  html: It was a good podcast.  It seemed like the regulars on packetpushers had trouble
    getting their head around VC (no offence) for some reason.  VC is essentially
    a very simplified and &quot;dumbed down&quot; switch.  I wrote a short blog post
    recently comparing the functionality of VC next to a basic D-Link switch where
    I argue the D-Link is a more capable device.

  html: I actually like the VC concept. There is a very good document called &quot;
    HP Virtual Connect for the Cisco Network Administrator&quot;. <br /><br />All
    it says is basically that VC is very much like vSwitch. I have lots of vSwitches
    in my network. They give me 0 problems. Actually, now the NOC doesn&#39;t have
    to bother configuring server ports. I wish all access layer switches would behave
    like vSwitch.<br /><br />Anyway, I think that HP FlexFabric (VC with 10G, vNIC
    and FCoE) is the best blade switch for HP. Passthrough for 4 blade chasis  in
    a rack (256 NICs), with 4 nics per server is not realistic for me. It also save
    tons of money for mezzanine cards. I don&#39;t need to buy HBAs and extra ethernet
    ports.<br /><br />Regarding FCoE, its doing only single hop FCoE, ending it at
    the VC itself, which is very nice start for FCoE implementation.<br /><br />Anyway,
    I am about to test it next week. I hope it works as advertised... :) Then I&#39;ll
    test IBM&#39;s FCoE, vNIC blade switch solutions.<br /><br />Dan.

  html: I believe that Virtual Connect was HP&#39;s approach to implementing a simple
    to understand (high-bandwidth) network solution for the HP C7000 Blade Enclosure.
    You only have to take one look at the GUI and almost immediately understand that
    this was built for server administrators not network engineers. It doesn&#39;t
    have all the bells and whistles because it doesn&#39;t really need them (at least
    not yet). And to date the product appears to work well and delivers. I can&#39;t
    disagree with Josh, when I first looked at the GUI I was very confused and it
    too me several days of exploring and reading before I could begin to understand
    the product because I was coming from a network engineer&#39;s mindset. Server
    administrators just want X, Y, X VLAN dropped on A, B, C NICs (or ports). They
    don&#39;t care to know or what to know anything more about the network. It was
    funny because my first question was something like &quot;where&#39;s the FDB/MAC
    table?&quot; Have you ever seen the CLI interface... it&#39;s by far the ugliest
    interface you&#39;ll ever see or have to work with.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t ventured
    into the whole FCoE thing just yet... I&#39;ll wait for others to blaze the trail.<br
    /><br />Cheers!

  html: Why do you compare VC with a network switch? In my opinion it&#39;s a virtualization
    layer between the servers and the network. It makes the management of the blade
    system much easier and since you can virtualize MAC and WWN addresses/ids you&#39;re
    not bound to specific component. You can even move servers from one chassis to
    another. If you use SAN boot, you can start the machine every you want, like a
    virtual machines. Lot&#39;s of benefits, even if VC is only a &quot;dumbed down&quot;
    switch. But the primary focus of VC is not switch functionality, it&#39;s virtualization!
