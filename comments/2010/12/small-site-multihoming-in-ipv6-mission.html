See http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-troan-multihoming-without-nat66-01<br /><br />You can get around the sending traffic out the wrong link using policy based routing (route on the source address). You have to depend on the host being able to choose a working SA/DA pair, which really requires Happy Eyeballs. http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wing-v6ops-happy-eyeballs-ipv6-01<br /><br />There are alternatives: SHIM6, LISP, ILNP, NAT66...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">@Ivan, why didnt you mention LISP? :-(<br /><br />Multihoming a v6 site without PI space &amp; BGP is easy peasy with LISP. You get 2 uplinks to whatever provider with whatever means, and the CPE will tell the mapping system where it&#39;s /48 (or /56 or whatever) is located. That&#39;s it, just 9 lines of configuration. <br /><br />This is real and working at this very moment.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">@Ole, <br /><br />Not true, LISP was designed with incremental deployment in mind. Multi-homing works fine the moment you configure two proxy-routers and have 2 uplinks. That&#39;s all.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">@Ivan<br /><br />Exactly! I still cannot ping you over LISP...<br /><br />The short version: Yes, LISP is being developed explicitly to address the scaling issues we face today and in a few years. Maintaining state in RAM is cheap. There can be many many  EID prefixes - and with LISP they can be aggregated heavily.The RLOC space (the current internet) is a mess anyway, LISP hopes to slow down the growth of the routing table.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The problem with multihoming is the fact that IPv4/IPv6 paths are calculated to the points of attachment, not end-nodes themselves. This effectively makes any additional layer of indirection such as LISP, unscalable, as decoupling locations from IDs brings the problem of validating the path liveness. Taking LISP-ALT architecture, we may notice that due to high aggregation and logical separation from the RLOC topology the destination EID would always be reported as reachable. Furthermore, the use of edge-aggregated (PA) space for RLOCs will also hide network failures at RLOC layer. Thus, every ITR has to probe every EID-&gt;RLOC mapping for liveness as the responding ETR has no idea whether the particular path is reachable from querying ITR. This problem is described in depth in: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-meyer-loc-id-implications-01 . This document also lists the site synchronization problem, which is a direct result of the &quot;caching&quot; and existence of multiple ingress/egress points for every LISP site.<br /><br />Adding another encapsulation layer is a serious architectural move with major implications. As I mentioned previously, LISP edge nodes are unware of the underlying RLOC topology (think of layer of indirection).  Every LISP site advertises mappings to ingress entry point being unware of the paths to these points. This results in the fact that traffic load-balancing that is optimum from the edge-site perspective may appear suboptimal from the underlying Internet perspective. In other words, the traffic matrix that LISP sites require may not fit well to the underlying Internet topology. Comparing this to single-ISP networks and MPLS/BGP VPNs you may notice that MPLS TE or IGP TE could be used to optimize the &quot;tunneled&quot; traffic flows. However, there is no common traffic engineering scheme for the Internet.<br /><br />Another problem from the set is the statement that RLOC space is poorly aggregatable because of PIs. This is not the only reason. Optimum aggregation requires the network topology to be hierarchical, which is not the case of the Internet, which is more of a self-similar graph. Internet is only hierarchical at the edge, where provider aggregation could be implemented. However, aggregating addresses in such topologies globally is not possible for hierarchial routing.<br /><br />To summarize, effective multihoming and mobility require changing the IP routing and addressing architecture. If we continue to remain within the limitations of hierarchical addressing and PoA addressing we&#39;ll result in moving the problem from one part of the network to another, but will never get a scalable solution.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">You don&#39;t need to wait for valid lifetime to expire, only preferred, and you can set that to zero immediately. Valid just means it won&#39;t tear down existing connections using that address; once it&#39;s deprecated (not preferred) no new connections will be sourced from that prefix. At least that&#39;s how it&#39;s supposed to work, feel free to report bugs.<br /><br />It&#39;s true that you don&#39;t get much control over which prefix your hosts use; there are some drafts in process to add this information to DHCPv6.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;m pretty sure neither my home-office nor my local small business network satisfies the current ARIN reqs for new v6 allocations: have v4 space already (nope, using v4 NAT multihoming) or satisfy the v4 requirements (25% utilization now, 50% within a year of a /24 if multihomed -- 64 hosts now, 128 hosts in a year). If you have 128 hosts in your home office, color me impressed.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I have this problem today.  I have 5 Internet providers over 3 sites, and only two would do any BGP if I went that way.  I have a unique local address scheme ready to go, but I can&#39;t get any ipv6 from any of my providers today, even if there was NAT66.  <br /><br />So I do nothing, as I can&#39;t have unpredictable client function because if I went with my ULA scheme browsers would do weirdness with no outbound egress but getting external AAAA records from the outside dns recursive servers.  <br /><br />Not even getting into infrastructure with no IPv6 support like WAAS, which my business relies on.  It&#39;s a mess and depressing.  <br /><br />Is it too late to go CLNS?</div>
