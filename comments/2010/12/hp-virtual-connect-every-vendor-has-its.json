I&#39;ve always appreciated that, while they have plenty of marketing whitepapers and such fluff, I can drill down to config manuals, tech notes, and design guides quite easily.",

      "html": "It was a good podcast.  It seemed like the regulars on packetpushers had trouble getting their head around VC (no offence) for some reason.  VC is essentially a very simplified and &quot;dumbed down&quot; switch.  I wrote a short blog post recently comparing the functionality of VC next to a basic D-Link switch where I argue the D-Link is a more capable device.",

      "html": "I actually like the VC concept. There is a very good document called &quot; HP Virtual Connect for the Cisco Network Administrator&quot;. <br /><br />All it says is basically that VC is very much like vSwitch. I have lots of vSwitches in my network. They give me 0 problems. Actually, now the NOC doesn&#39;t have to bother configuring server ports. I wish all access layer switches would behave like vSwitch.<br /><br />Anyway, I think that HP FlexFabric (VC with 10G, vNIC and FCoE) is the best blade switch for HP. Passthrough for 4 blade chasis  in a rack (256 NICs), with 4 nics per server is not realistic for me. It also save tons of money for mezzanine cards. I don&#39;t need to buy HBAs and extra ethernet ports.<br /><br />Regarding FCoE, its doing only single hop FCoE, ending it at the VC itself, which is very nice start for FCoE implementation.<br /><br />Anyway, I am about to test it next week. I hope it works as advertised... :) Then I&#39;ll test IBM&#39;s FCoE, vNIC blade switch solutions.<br /><br />Dan.",

      "html": "I believe that Virtual Connect was HP&#39;s approach to implementing a simple to understand (high-bandwidth) network solution for the HP C7000 Blade Enclosure. You only have to take one look at the GUI and almost immediately understand that this was built for server administrators not network engineers. It doesn&#39;t have all the bells and whistles because it doesn&#39;t really need them (at least not yet). And to date the product appears to work well and delivers. I can&#39;t disagree with Josh, when I first looked at the GUI I was very confused and it too me several days of exploring and reading before I could begin to understand the product because I was coming from a network engineer&#39;s mindset. Server administrators just want X, Y, X VLAN dropped on A, B, C NICs (or ports). They don&#39;t care to know or what to know anything more about the network. It was funny because my first question was something like &quot;where&#39;s the FDB/MAC table?&quot; Have you ever seen the CLI interface... it&#39;s by far the ugliest interface you&#39;ll ever see or have to work with.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t ventured into the whole FCoE thing just yet... I&#39;ll wait for others to blaze the trail.<br /><br />Cheers!",

      "html": "Why do you compare VC with a network switch? In my opinion it&#39;s a virtualization layer between the servers and the network. It makes the management of the blade system much easier and since you can virtualize MAC and WWN addresses/ids you&#39;re not bound to specific component. You can even move servers from one chassis to another. If you use SAN boot, you can start the machine every you want, like a virtual machines. Lot&#39;s of benefits, even if VC is only a &quot;dumbed down&quot; switch. But the primary focus of VC is not switch functionality, it&#39;s virtualization!",
