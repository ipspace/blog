  html: 'Architecturally, indeed, OSI protocol stack was more scalable than IPv4 back
    in 90s. Well, they didn&#39;t make the right choice then. It&#39;s too late to
    change the history now: all &quot;better&quot; IPng proposals such as TUBA, Nimrod
    etc have been rejected and rather boring SIP (IPv6) has been selected for &quot;adoption&quot;.
    Security? QoS? Scalability? LOL. Nothing really differs IPv6 from IPv4 besides
    the larger addressing space. Which, in turn, may be the serious problem for routing
    systems.<br /><br />In fact, the Internet below the application level is the same
    it was almost 30 years ago, just stretched to match the applications that have
    been deployed. There have been NO architectural innovations since those old days.
    Sad, but we have to support the huge and pretty inflexible complex of technologies,
    praying that Moore law would give us enough time invent yet another band aid solution

  html: Thanks for the blog post Ivan.  I&#39;m an old timer too, but the transition
    from IPX/SPX to dual stack TCP/IP with LANworkplace for DOS I recall was easier
    than going IPv4 to IPv6.  And that&#39;s a bit insane...  :-). Thanks!

  html: Well, there are at least five differences between the migrations we did then
    and IPv4-to-IPv6 one:<br /><br />* We were late entrants, not early adopters.
    Although the TCP/IP stacks on DOS were awful (we were selling FTP Software and
    had &quot;interesting&quot; support issues), at least TCP/IP protocol suite was
    stable.<br />* We were usually not running the same application over both stacks
    concurrently.<br />* Most applications were not mission-critical, so we were not
    concerned about redundancy, dual-homing, fail-over ...<br />* Users (and ourselves)
    were not spoiled. Believe it or not, IPv4 has raised the bar significantly in
    the last decades.<br />* We were younger ;)
