      "html": "This is discussion about home broadband connectivity - but mobile providers are chapter on its own. Caps and limits everywhere. And while US carriers (pipes) get under fire for Internet Neutrality Act, this is something I&#39;d consider being more than just raising an eyebrow and whistling: http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/12/carriers-net-neutrality-tiers/ Okay I know there had been call for wide internet QoS at carrier level, but specially page 18 displays nothing but pure greed. This may not be way to go either.",

Products are multi-dimensional as I have described here: http://thinkingproblemmanagement.blogspot.com/2010/12/product-amplifier.html<br /><br />Typically, Starbucks has product differentiation at higher prices and no-one calls them greedy, but dare a service provider try and do the same!!!!!!",

      "html": "Thanks for the link. Interesting presentation, but nothing I haven&#39;t seen before (and seeing Wired &amp; Co trying to make &quot;news&quot; out of each such event is becoming boring).<br /><br />As for page 18, you can look at it from another perspective: someone has to pay for the bandwidth. It can be the consumer through monthly bill (fixed or pay-per-usage) or the content provider.<br /><br />The business model is also not new: every time you order a catalog from a retailer (Quelle comes to mind if you&#39;re in Europe), they send you one (including paying the postage) even through you might never buy anything from them.<br /><br />However, I am positive many SPs will try to do double-dipping and I have to agree with this article: http://www.fiberevolution.com/2010/12/internet-service-guarantees-is-what-net-neutrality-and-consumers-need.html - we need transparency in service definitions.",
