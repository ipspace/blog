            <div class="comment-content">Actually the content providers are customers of the large interconnect ISPs, so there still might be something to do there ? <br /><br />Surely companies like level3, cogent, ... would be fans of secure bgp I think. <br /><br />The main problem, it seems to me, is agreeing<br />(1) who signs IP address space requests, and therefore gets the option to knock anyone offline world-wide (this is going to be the American govt. probably, and too many nutcases shit themselves when they hear this)<br />(2) getting pressure on router makers (ie. cisco, and juniper, if you have those behind you, you&#39;re pretty much done I think)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The problem is that secure BGP routing is not possible AT ALL with existing routing architecture - even if you magically implement sBGP or so-BGP. The main reason is hop-by-hop independence, where every node or AS performs routing/forwarding decision on its own. Thus, for example, even if you validate that AS X is responsible for prefix Y and does have Path Z to reach it, you cannot really be sure that AS X will use the path Z to reach Y. As soon as you hand your packet to AS X you lose control over forwarding. <br /><br />A possible change could be replacing existing distributed routing with source-based routing model, where ingress point enforces a given path across the internetwork. This is possible using cryptographic method, but obviously such solution will have scalability issues.<br /><br />The modern internet operates loosely based on &quot;free market&quot; principles, or in other words its behavior might be described by game theory. As long as all independent agents agree to some rules of &quot;rational&quot; behavior (e.g. I do not abuse TCP congestion rules.. or I do not engineer traffic to gain local avantage...), they all get some &quot;fair&quot; share of &quot;benefits&quot;. However, there is no stable state of equilibrium in such complex system - one cannot be sure that all agents behave rationally and seek profit (e.g. government intervention may circumvent this assumption) plus you cannot avoid various temporary &quot;coalitions&quot; seeking better margins above their average share.<br /><br />One good example is the &quot;best effort&quot; QoS model we have in the internet now. It is assumed that every individual member follows some &quot;honest&quot; rules of congestion control behavior, resulting in more or less equilibrium state. However if multiple nodes start abusing those rules (e.g. opening multiple TCP sessions to overcome TCP slow start limitations) the global equilibrium could be broken.  <br /><br />Once again, the problem of security could never be solved completely - just alleviated to some extent. Unless a group of agents is under common control you cannot enforce a security policy for the group. Just like real people, independent agents follow the rules of the &quot;economy&quot;, resulting in complex dynamics, which could be classified as &quot;secure&quot; only to the extent we believe in &quot;rational&quot; behavior of each and every agent.</div>
