      "html": "&quot;Google IPv6 statistics \u2013 0.2% of Google\u2019s traffic is IPv6. Did anyone notice we\u2019re running out of IPv4 addresses?&quot;<br /><br />In order to access Google IPv6 it is not enough to be IPv6 capable. Google via IPv6 is only available for networks that are IPv6 only or dual-stack networks that have seperate IPv6 DNS servers and have filled out a form to request access for Google-IPv6.<br />(http://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/)<br /><br />So even if you have a dual-stack network, and perhaps with seperate DNS servers, you won&#39;t be able to access google via ipv6 until you fill out the request form. And how many admins will go through, or know about that process?<br /><br />With this in mind, is Google IPv6 statistics relevant?",
