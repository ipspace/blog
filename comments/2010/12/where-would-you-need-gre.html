            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan! GRE is a great thing! I&#39;ve some small places connected via satellite links. These satellite technology are IP based, not clear channel. A few months ago, I found a little problem with it: they don&#39;t support OSPF and a lot of IP features between my routers and the satellite router. So, using GRE to bypass all the not-so-standard satellite mesh Save my life.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I am GRE lover too. But I am not sure which is a better solution, GRE or OSPF redistribution in my current company. I am wondering if Ivan or other experts would have time to drop some lines here. <br />I was working for a smaller company, which has hub and spoke topology and runs IPsec over GRE from hub to each spoke via MPLS of a ISP. EIGRP is running accross GRE tunnels. Now I am working for a bigger company, which has two MPLS ISPs and runs OSPF mutual re-distributions to inject the routes learned from each ISP to LAN  and route-map filter based on the tagging to prevent un-necessary routes learned from one ISP from being injected to the other ISP. I heard the main reason not to use GRE is because of MTU. GRE overheard requires routers configured to use lower MTU size, otherwise, too many TCP re-transmission would cause network delay and kill some applications. I think it might be true. But the solution we had in my previous smaller company is on the user end. All the PC images come with MTU size 1400. It&#39;s not complicated and it&#39;s working fine. I have to admit that the OSPF mutual re-distribution design is very interesting but it adds difficulties to troubleshooting. <br />Appreciate it if you could make some comment here.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&gt;Various SSL VPNs, which put private IP packets into SSL (encrypted HTTP)<br />SSL VPN is not necessarily encrypted HTTP. E.g. OpenVPN is a stand-alone protocol.<br /><br />Guest: GRE does have some overhead, but usually it&#39;s not a trouble. Path MTU discovery usually works well in private networks, so TCP works fine too. Even if for some reason it doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s possible to manually adjust MSS for the interface. My favorite setup for VPN over a public network is GRE over IPsec with OSPF routing.</div>

HTTPS ;)<br /><br />HTTP and HTTPS are just two protocols that happen to be used by web browsers most of the time, but can be used by a number of other things (including curl and wget).</em><br /><br />Actually, that isn&#39;t quite correct.  OpenVPN runs on whatever port is configured, with the default being 1194.  Many people use OpenVPN in TCP mode on port 443 out of convenience with firewall rules; however, when you do that, using the port assigned for HTTPS is the only thing it shares with HTTPS.<br /><br />Sending encrypted data over TCP Port 443 does not make something HTTPS.  You still have to utilize the HTTP protocol over the SSL/TLS encryption layer in order for it to be HTTPS.<br /><br />The OpenVPN protocol itself does use SSL/TLS for encryption, but shares nothing at all with HTTP.  The protocol used for an encrypted OpenVPN packet has more in common with an IPSec ESP packet than it does with an HTTP request.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I use GRE, but I don&#39;t understand how GRE is functionally better than pure IP-over-IP.  In essence GRE just adds one field &quot;protocol type&quot; for demultiplexing, but IP also have a field, that can be used for the same purpose. In case of GRE encapsulation it&#39;s just occupied by GRE proto number 47.  I think it&#39;s more question of convenience, than functionality, IP proto field is managed by IANA, but GRE &quot;protocol type&quot; is the same as ethertype, so GRE gives a convenient layer of abstraction from IANA.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">An old post but thought I&#39;ll mention something not often mentioned. Personally, I think good old GRE has got far more implemented IPv4 features than LISP, especially when PIM BiDir and/or other types of multicast are involved. I also find it very helpful when GRE and IPSec can be done over two devices, which can give you much more bandwidth than single device based on IOS[XE] platforms (irritatingly, their recent stupid aggregated license deliberately slow you down, killing IPSec tunnel traffic in the process).  </div>
