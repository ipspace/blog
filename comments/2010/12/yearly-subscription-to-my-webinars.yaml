  html: IMO the term &quot;yearly subscription&quot; generally means that it includes
    everything produced that year. As this deal is for three webinars I&#39;d suggest
    a calling it a &quot;three pack&quot; or something else indicating of that it&#39;s
    a package of three webinars of the purchasers choice. <br /><br />Just my 2 cents.

  html: Thanks for the comment! It could indeed be confusing.<br /><br />When choosing
    the name, I decided to use the &quot;yearly subscription&quot; because you have
    access to all of my materials for a year. Any better suggestion?
