Wisdom and knowledge is out there, just go and get it, paper does not mean you are smart, innovative or good team player. Paper just means you can obey, act humble and compress all possible not necessary stuff through your brains.  <br /><br />Agree with the rest of the article, 100%.<br /><br />Cheers, Jan<br /><br />P.S: Maybe I really should never have ceremony speeches in academic buildings :)",

That&#39;s how long I&#39;ve been working in this industry without graduating from any college/university and I&#39;ve been very successful. I don&#39;t think that not having a degree/diploma has hurt me, and I&#39;ve gotten more than one job where the advertisement listed a degree as a requirement. Rather than &quot;it&#39;s important to graduate&quot; maybe it should be &quot;it&#39;s important to finish projects that you start&quot; :) It&#39;s all good advice though!",

Now I regret that I didn&#39;t finish when I was young and had the time to do it. Working a full time career and going back to school, even part time, sucks.  At my current pace it is going to take me 5 years to finish what I could have done in the past in 2, with the added bonus of not having to be &quot;The Old Guy&quot; in class.  Even though I have a great job and a CCIE, I feel that I missed out on some great learning by not sitting through all those classes, whether related to my job or not.  In short - Is it needed?  No.  Is it helpful? Yes.",
