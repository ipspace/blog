            <div class="comment-content">I can think of no earthly reason why a normal residential customer should be handed out /48s as a matter of course. By special -- justified -- request, yes, but it should never be the default.<br /><br />On the other hand, however, I&#39;d be wary of giving out anything smaller than a /64, as that&#39;s the size required for autoconfiguration to work (working on the basis that sensible CPE will run some kind of route-advertisement service for the prefix). If DHCPv6 ever becomes prevalent, this might change, but I wouldn&#39;t want to rely on that any time in the next few years.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&quot;[...]so I asked about the reasons why someone might want to give a residential user a /48 [...]&quot;<br />Let&#39;s ask the question the other way around : Why NOT give residential users /48 ?<br /><br />Sure, /64 may be enough for *today* typical uses. Can you tell if it will still be enough in ten years ?<br />Are IPv6 &quot;expensive&quot; enough that it&#39;s worth taking the risk of having to entirely rework your IP allocation scheme in a few years ?<br /><br />It seems to me that planning to provide residential users with /64 is a result of 3 totally wrong hypotheses : <br />1) Residential users will never need more than a /64. Ever.<br />2) It&#39;s more expensive to hand out 48/ than it is to hand out /64<br />3) If statements 1 turns out to be wrong, It&#39;s easy to move to /48</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The real question is: why not? Why you don&#39;t want to give out /48 to residential costumers?<br /><br />The only reason I can think of is address wasting, but I *really* don&#39;t mind. Providers will waste a whole lot more addresses giving a /64 to point-to-point networks anyway. After that logic, it boils down to &quot;it&#39;s designed that way&quot;. So the final question is: why not?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">In my mind, why give a /64? We obviously don&#39;t have any address shortages in v6 world in the near or short term future.<br /><br />/64 is a LAN size. No need to segment further than that, and in fact, things break when you do, as Ivan has pointed out in previous blogs.<br /><br />We should assume that residential users will want to have more than one LAN in the future. Especially in the sense that service providers will want to offer triple-play type services over the same link and CPE device. Home automation networks, guest wireless networks, etc. These are all things being done today, and who knows what might come in the future.<br /><br />A /48 allows for plenty of future uses, and it&#39;s not that much of a stretch for providers to be assigning them a /48. At the bare minimum, give them a /56, which gives them 256 /64&#39;s to work with. Things like DHCP6-PD will make this really easy.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The only technical argument I&#39;m aware of would be to make NAT66 work, but NAT66 is changing and the whole purpose of giving ample address space was to avoid NATs in the first place.<br /><br />A /64 could only be recommended in cases where you know there is a single link / single host. If a router is connected a shorter prefix length must be used. It is convenient for the purpose of reverse delegation that this is on a nibble boundary. Some service providers will assign a fixed prefix size to all their customers e.g. a /56 others will delegate on a documented need basis. e.g. 4 /64s for most residential customers.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I think Kim Johnsson has an important aspect, because this are probably the same considerations which some people did during the design &amp; implementation of IPv4 some decades ago...<br /><br /> In my personal opinion, /64 should be sufficient for the average residential customer which just uses the internet access.<br />But there are also customers with more advanced skills like us networking guys - I&#39;ve currently several private /24 networks in use (wired LAN, wireless LAN, home lab, ...), so if I had to move to IPv6, /64 would not be sufficient, /56 should be...<br /><br />I think the best way would be assigning a /64 by default and expand it to /whatever if the customer requests it (and maybe charge it if more than /48 is needed f.e.).<br /><br />NAT66 with ULA could also be an option...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">RFC3177 provides good reasoning on why go with /48 for everyone. It discusses Kim&#39;s &quot;explosive address exhaustion&quot; counter-argument as well. There is no &quot;killer&quot; reason to go with either /64 or /48 for residential customers though, I believe.<br /><br />As for IPv4 address space consideration, which was made over 30 years ago, no one really expected internet to grow beyond a research project :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">/64 is generally accepted as a bad idea (except for 6rd, where a /32 plus 32 bits of v4 address give a /64, but that&#39;s a special case for transition technology). /56 and /48 are both reasonable, but there is a reason you might want a /48 even if you&#39;re not likely to have &gt;256 networks in a home: easy automated hierarchical delegation in a routed home. If you delegate a /48 to the ISP-facing CPE, it can then delegate (for instance) a /56 to each routing device connected to it, and each of those devices can have multiple interfaces and possibly more devices behind them.<br /><br />The 8 bit boundary (/48 to /56) is arbitrary, it could as easily be 4, 5, or 6 bits. The point is that with 16 bits to work with, you can have a lot of flexibility in delegation, allowing for both plenty of levels of depth and plenty of devices at each level, but with only 8 bits those tradeoffs become much more acute. So, without a pressing reason to assign less than a /48, just use /48.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">On a related issue that I&#39;m investigating, RIRs also have a very stringent policy to give address space to ISPs. You need a .94  occupancy HD ratio to get a second /32, and that seems to be really packed.<br />No wonder they treat v6 address space as premium, and want to assign even /128s :)<br /><br />It boils down to an old saying we have: he who ever got burned with milk sees a cow and cries.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">RFC3177 explains it really well... true. Just two thoughts on the topic:<br />for &quot;really big networks&quot; RFC3177 recommends to assign a /47 or several /48 prefixes... I assume, really big networks will be multihomed anyway and will need to have their own IP range - the regional registrar will decide how big the range gets.<br />The multihoming topic is an interesting topic. I don&#39;t think that using more than one prefix on your hosts (one from each upstream provider) is a valuable solution. This leads either to NAT66 or own IP range (usually /48). I really don&#39;t want to implement NAT for multihoming and using provider independent address space leads to a big routing table.<br /><br />/48 for customers makes complete sense. It&#39;s easy to understand, the customer can use /56 for his subnetworks and /64 for his segments. Service Provider wise, you&#39;ll only have /48 and /64 networks (and /128 for loopbacks) in your own routing table. Pretty neat. Makes the subnet calculation easier ;)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The 6rd deployments that I know of target a /60 for each customer, which should be ok for the transition time. <br /><br />I still believe the /56 would be better as well. Because with a /48 you can fit only 65k customers in a /32, whereas with a /56 you can fit 16M, which is enough for most ISPs in most countries.<br />But probably a lot of people can justify why we need 65k subnets @home (sure we don&#39;t talk about small businesses here).<br />In the end, I don&#39;t really care, and as I&#39;ve already read somewhere, if we burn too fast the 2000::/3, we can still change the policy for 4000::/3 :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">My favourite reason is &quot;16 bits for customer for networks&quot;. In this case customer have full field between consecutive &quot;:&quot; to use for whatever subnetworking schema he might come up with. It just makes sense. With /56 customer needs to calculate the boundary... Addressing-schematic-wise it is a good choice, maybe your customer needs subnetworks that makes sense to him, maybe building number/floor/room or maybe postal address of the location where network is - this is freedom of IPv6, don&#39;t get this away from them...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Jan, but the question was more about small end-users. I think everybody agrees that even a small company should get a /48 (65k * /64). But residential users (by far representing the highest number of allocations) could probably live very well with a /56 (256 * /64). And any ISP could offer as a premium to get a /48 if required...<br />As I was saying earlier, in a /32, you can fit 16M /56 but only 65k /48. Even though we have tons of space in v6 (see http://goo.gl/RCrHk for graphical view), these numbers look quite reasonable.</div>

Of course there are all sorts of better ways of doing it (not to mention that you have to explode 48-bit MAC address into 64 bit host ID first) and a number of nasty consequences of having globally-unique host ids (think about cookieless user tracking), but that&#39;s life ...</div>

Personally I don&#39;t see the need for a /48 for consumers.

            <div class="comment-content">Personally I don&#39;t have a problem with a /56 per user. As the relevant authorities have decided to waste just one part of the address space, it&#39;s feasible to experiment with a /48 per user ... but then the default LIR allocation has to change to be significantly bigger than /32, otherwise the address space will get way too fragmented.<br /><br />The real problem is that there is no consensus. Various entities in the allocation chain are doing what they think is best, not necessarily leading to an optimum solution.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">So just to be more clear, my advice is an /56 or /48, not a /64. Our policy is /56 for everyone, when the customer tells us he wants more, he gets a /48 from a different pool no questions asked.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">With a /48-per-customer you&#39;ve just given ISP an option of having 120K customers without fragmentation. Not much, I would guess.<br /><br />With a /56-per-customer that becomes 2M+ customers, which might be reasonable for many ISPs.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Unofficially RIPE reserve a /29 per ISP, but I agree using /56&#39;s would give us much more space as the consumer doesn&#39;t need more then a /56 imho. 256 subnets of 18 quadrillion addresses will be enough.<br /><br />The main problem is the lack of the RFC describing a /56 to be adviced (RFC3177bis is still a draft). I also see DSL-router vendors to first support a /48.<br /><br />Other values like a /63, /60 or other values are not advised to be used as there is no RFC to support them and no vendor who will test their low-end CPE with these values.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">A lot of this depends on whether we will retain the idea of PA and PI space. Most residential users wouldn&#39;t need more than a /96 (giving them a personal allocation equivalent to the entire IPv4 address space), however we don&#39;t want Internet routers to have to learn routes to every single endpoint customer in the world (as well as the 500k IPv4 tables it&#39;ll likely be dual stacking with). If we retain the idea of PA (Provider Aggregated) space, then the wider internet will only have 1 route to the /29 for that ISP, internally they may subnet that down to hundreds of millions of customer ranges without impacting routing tables of their peers. The size of those end user networks would then be driven by their internal routing capabilities and customer requirements. <br />A uniquely advertised prefix is only truly necessary if it is going to be dual homed to more than one provider.</div>
