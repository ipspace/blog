            <div class="comment-content">This is discussion about home broadband connectivity - but mobile providers are chapter on its own. Caps and limits everywhere. And while US carriers (pipes) get under fire for Internet Neutrality Act, this is something I&#39;d consider being more than just raising an eyebrow and whistling: http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/12/carriers-net-neutrality-tiers/ Okay I know there had been call for wide internet QoS at carrier level, but specially page 18 displays nothing but pure greed. This may not be way to go either.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I think this whole net neutrality debate is single dimensional.  Products are multi-dimensional as I have described here: http://thinkingproblemmanagement.blogspot.com/2010/12/product-amplifier.html<br /><br />Typically, Starbucks has product differentiation at higher prices and no-one calls them greedy, but dare a service provider try and do the same!!!!!!</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Thanks for the link. Interesting presentation, but nothing I haven&#39;t seen before (and seeing Wired &amp; Co trying to make &quot;news&quot; out of each such event is becoming boring).<br /><br />As for page 18, you can look at it from another perspective: someone has to pay for the bandwidth. It can be the consumer through monthly bill (fixed or pay-per-usage) or the content provider.<br /><br />The business model is also not new: every time you order a catalog from a retailer (Quelle comes to mind if you&#39;re in Europe), they send you one (including paying the postage) even through you might never buy anything from them.<br /><br />However, I am positive many SPs will try to do double-dipping and I have to agree with this article: http://www.fiberevolution.com/2010/12/internet-service-guarantees-is-what-net-neutrality-and-consumers-need.html - we need transparency in service definitions.</div>
