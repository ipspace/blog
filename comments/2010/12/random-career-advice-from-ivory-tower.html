            <div class="comment-content">Important to graduate? Well, maybe for some people. Never saw any value in that, never really cared :) Piece of paper and washed out brain. Wisdom and knowledge is out there, just go and get it, paper does not mean you are smart, innovative or good team player. Paper just means you can obey, act humble and compress all possible not necessary stuff through your brains.  <br /><br />Agree with the rest of the article, 100%.<br /><br />Cheers, Jan<br /><br />P.S: Maybe I really should never have ceremony speeches in academic buildings :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">You also don&#39;t need a piece of paper to prove you can finish a project. 15-20years? That&#39;s how long I&#39;ve been working in this industry without graduating from any college/university and I&#39;ve been very successful. I don&#39;t think that not having a degree/diploma has hurt me, and I&#39;ve gotten more than one job where the advertisement listed a degree as a requirement. Rather than &quot;it&#39;s important to graduate&quot; maybe it should be &quot;it&#39;s important to finish projects that you start&quot; :) It&#39;s all good advice though!</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Don&#39;t think paper can give you those superpowers to complete the projects that you partially don&#39;t like. You know me, I worked with lot&#39;s of different people and usually I observed that self-educated people are more persistent in trying to figure out things they don&#39;t like or even understand. It&#39;s more &quot;attitude&quot; thing...<br /><br />Maybe I met and worked with different people :)<br /><br />/jan</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;m going to have to side with Ivan on this one.  I thought I was too smart for college and dropped out my sophomore year.  Now I regret that I didn&#39;t finish when I was young and had the time to do it. Working a full time career and going back to school, even part time, sucks.  At my current pace it is going to take me 5 years to finish what I could have done in the past in 2, with the added bonus of not having to be &quot;The Old Guy&quot; in class.  Even though I have a great job and a CCIE, I feel that I missed out on some great learning by not sitting through all those classes, whether related to my job or not.  In short - Is it needed?  No.  Is it helpful? Yes.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I agree that graduating is not the ultimate task to achieve, on the other side the study of various theoretical concepts definively outlines you the current possibilities of computer science, give you an idea where the battle fields exists, who&amp;how is fighting them to extend the science in that area. <br />That knowledge is what gives you with getting the big picture.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I vote for graduation advice :) Not much because it&#39;s complicated project, but more because it gives you a wide base of fundamental knowledge from multiple disciplines. Not to mention you get those nice studying habits and have the chance to learn mathematics! I have hardly seen anyone who was able to learn mathematics (algebra, calculus, discrete math, differential equations etc) on their own, without attending a college/university.</div>
