            <div class="comment-content">As much as I agree that NAT64 stinks and NAT46 is total pain in the ass I don&#39;t see reason for disabling both IPv4 and IPv6 CEFs. In scenarios where we have one interface as IPv6-only and other one as IPv4-only you have disable IPv6 CEF because it will drop all packets due to no route to ::/0. Disabling IPv4 CEF is not necessary in this scenario (tested on 15.0M, working fine). Also if you have IPv6 connection to your ISP and want to make backward compatibility with IPv4 networks disabling IPv6 CEF is not necessary. Of course NAT-PT will be process switched but all traffic that can be handled by CEF will be processed this way.  <br /> <br />I made quick test in scenario with IPv6-only (ipv6ip tunnel) and IPv4-only (hardware) interfaces. With disabled IPv6 I got about 4Mbit throughput and 70% of CPU usage. Disabling IPv4 CEF had no inpact on traffic.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">What should small ISP do? Throw away Cisco 7200/7600 platforms and buy an ASR1000?  <br />How much IPv6 transition will cost?  <br />In IOS routers you can disable v4v6 dynamic NAT-PT. It is so hard for Cisco remove DNS-ALG from NAT-PT and add DNS64? Why NAT64 is supported only with IOS-XR?  <br />How much money hardware vendors could get for selling new hardware for IPv6? <br />From a different point of view we could be forced to upgrade our hardware because of CPU power limitations in not IOS-XR platforms. What do you think?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Let&#39;s be honest. 7200 and 7600 are old platforms and it&#39;s been obvious for a few years that Cisco tries to extend their lifetime as long as possible. They are still part of mainstream and SP IOS images, but things happen somewhat faster in the XE world.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Thankyou very much for you answer Ivan, but, let&#39;s say that I use NATPT-DNSALG-NAT46=NAT64 in my 7200 platform. I can setup a DNS64 server (for example with bind) because it is unrelated to NAT.  If I&#39;m correct on this I have a working NAT64 platform.  Uhmmm, yes, but, without CEF ...  So, my only hope is that Cisco will add support for CEF in future IOS releases (I check the 15.1 IOS but I&#39;m unable to find any reference to it). I hope that NAT-PT RFC will be rewritten and supported. <br /><br /><br />Thankyou <br />Gianrico</div>
