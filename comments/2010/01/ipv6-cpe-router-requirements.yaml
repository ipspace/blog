  html: Few comments...<br /><br />1. DHCPv6 server shouldn&#39;t be a must on LAN
    side. In SLAAC there is some sort of RDNS (Recursive DNS) provisioning option.
    Some hw already supports this option (like Mikrotik router :)<br /><br />2. You
    said &quot;someone finally realized&quot;. Well, that &quot;someone&quot; is Ole
    Troan from Cisco Norway, he is also editor of WT192 broadband forum paper, that
    deals with IPv6 requirements for CPE (same stuff as here). He is very good guy,
    knows exactly what he is talking about. Sometimes we exchange an opinion or two
    :)<br /><br />Jan

  html: '#1: You&#39;re right. Too bad they did not require support for RFC 5006 on
    the LAN side.'

  html: Don&#39;t forget DHCP-PD! A cpe router would not be much use without it.
