  html: few restrictions i could quickly think worth mentioning when &quot;ip ospf
    database-filter all out&quot; is configured on hub and static default is used
    on spokes -<br /><br />1. For DMVPN phase2, this wont work as the spokes need
    the actual tunnel IP address of the other spokes as next-hop for direct spoke
    to spoke communication<br />2. typically the spokes would already have a default
    route towards their ISP for internet access. <br /><br />Swap<br />#19804

  html: '&quot;you have to use static default routes on the hub routers&quot; - I
    think you meant to say &quot;spoke routers&quot; here?'

  html: You&#39;re absolutely right. It helps if your network uses a nice addressing
    range so you don&#39;t have to use a default route on the spoke routers. Otherwise
    VRFs should help ;)

  html: An alternative, for example if we are using an IOS that do not support this
    feature or we are using another vendor, could be to MaxAge all the LSA&#39;s from
    the Hub increasing the transmit delay to 3600 seconds. However, the adjacency
    will be broken due to &quot;too many retransmissions&quot; , to avoid that we
    should increase the retransmit interval to a high value in order to maintain the
    adjacency up.<br /><br />So, the configuration in the Hub would be:<br /><br />interface
    <br />ip ospf retransmit-interval 6000  <br />ip ospf transmit-delay 3600  <br
    /><br />Best Regards.  <br /><br /><br />

    html: Yes, it would. Not the best idea in OSPF world...

  html: Hi, By filtering LSAs, won&#39;t this lead to inconsistent LSDB on the routers
    in the same area?
