I no longer do but have kept an interest in the evolution and so I can slip back into the work should I want to (sadly its always at the expense of my bread &amp; butter MPLS Carrier Design roles so I probably won&#39;t) <br /><br />Anyway, here are a couple of links discussing the issues. Its very much to do with the radio states and channels. (The air interface)<br /><br /><br />both start up latency and your regular latency are discussed.<br /><br />1. (Read the comments, more of an business analysis on mobile blog)<br /><br />http://disruptivewireless.blogspot.com/2008/07/latency-in-mobile-more-needs-to-be-done.html<br /><br /><br />2. (Read his articles he links too -- This is a great blog for watching the 3gpp standards evolving and he explains them too.)<br /><br />http://mobilesociety.typepad.com/mobile_life/2010/01/solutions-in-the-pipe-for-faster-3g-browsing-startup.html<br /><br />3. (Not to do with latency but in depth descriptions of the standards..)<br /><br />http://wired-n-wireless.blogspot.com/2009/10/lte-whitepaper-from-wired-n-wireless.html<br /><br />An interesting aspect is everyone saying LTE having an all flat architecture with less devices etc in the path will help.. I dont buy it.  Even in 2000 there was no congestion (1gig edge 2.5 gig backbone)  and as such from the packet core entry point just propagation latency. That firmly lays the blame downstream to Radio Area Network (RAN) and the Air interface (Radio)  <br /><br />That used to be  mobile--air--3g--nodeb--atm--rnc--atm--sgsn--gige--ggsn--gige--mpls_backbone (Pos).<br /><br />Now is air-hsdpa-nodeb-(Vpls)-rnc--gige--sgsn---10gige--ggsn--10gige--mpls_backbone (Pos/10GE)<br /><br />LTE will be  air--OFDM/LTE--enhanced_nodeb--ethernet_backhaul--enhanced_Serving Gateway---etherent--enhanced_packet_gateway---MPLS_backbone (40gig)    (Here you see the devices collapsed) <br /><br />apologies for any mistakes in the above but i did this quick :-).<br /><br />When discussing the latency in 2000/1 (Yes I noticed immediately and raised it) with my colleague Vendor Radio guys, they said &quot;You IP guys will just never get a handle on how radio is working&quot;... I said then it was unacceptable. Glad to see they learned.",

Since you&#39;re more likely to get<br />whole chains of errors or missing stuff in a radio type link than the single bit errors<br />you get in most other contexts, one approach (also used on CDs) is to send one bit<br />each of a bunch of codewords, then another bit of each, then another, and so on. so if you lose multiple bits in a row all that happens is you&#39;ve slighting damaged each of several different codewords and can recover them all. However, this approach massively increases serialization of any single codeword. <br /><br />As I say, this may have nothing whatever to do with the problem you are seeing.",

I would think it&#39;s due to the encoding/decoding of the radio signal what with the spread spectrum and signal bouncing. It would be interesting to know in which direction the signal is slowest.<br /><br />Also, it&#39;s good to keep in mind that the uplink speed is much slower than the downlink speed.<br /><br />But I never worked with the radio parts, so I don&#39;t know any details.",
