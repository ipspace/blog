  html: Totally agree, to the point that I&#39;d argue that 3G wireless is just not
    even really a viable alternative as a backup for any sort of wired/fibre link...simply
    because of the latency.

  html: Unsure what the cause is but here in Oz about 6 months ago we had a major
    carrier make some invisible change on their 3G network and had the latency drop
    from 400ms down to sub-200ms. We didn&#39;t change anything - it&#39;s still not
    great but it is better.

  html: Many years ago I worked on getting a Vendors Packet Core devices to adhere
    to the 3gpp standards. I no longer do but have kept an interest in the evolution
    and so I can slip back into the work should I want to (sadly its always at the
    expense of my bread &amp; butter MPLS Carrier Design roles so I probably won&#39;t)
    <br /><br />Anyway, here are a couple of links discussing the issues. Its very
    much to do with the radio states and channels. (The air interface)<br /><br /><br
    />both start up latency and your regular latency are discussed.<br /><br />1.
    (Read the comments, more of an business analysis on mobile blog)<br /><br />http://disruptivewireless.blogspot.com/2008/07/latency-in-mobile-more-needs-to-be-done.html<br
    /><br /><br />2. (Read his articles he links too -- This is a great blog for watching
    the 3gpp standards evolving and he explains them too.)<br /><br />http://mobilesociety.typepad.com/mobile_life/2010/01/solutions-in-the-pipe-for-faster-3g-browsing-startup.html<br
    /><br />3. (Not to do with latency but in depth descriptions of the standards..)<br
    /><br />http://wired-n-wireless.blogspot.com/2009/10/lte-whitepaper-from-wired-n-wireless.html<br
    /><br />An interesting aspect is everyone saying LTE having an all flat architecture
    with less devices etc in the path will help.. I dont buy it.  Even in 2000 there
    was no congestion (1gig edge 2.5 gig backbone)  and as such from the packet core
    entry point just propagation latency. That firmly lays the blame downstream to
    Radio Area Network (RAN) and the Air interface (Radio)  <br /><br />That used
    to be  mobile--air--3g--nodeb--atm--rnc--atm--sgsn--gige--ggsn--gige--mpls_backbone
    (Pos).<br /><br />Now is air-hsdpa-nodeb-(Vpls)-rnc--gige--sgsn---10gige--ggsn--10gige--mpls_backbone
    (Pos/10GE)<br /><br />LTE will be  air--OFDM/LTE--enhanced_nodeb--ethernet_backhaul--enhanced_Serving
    Gateway---etherent--enhanced_packet_gateway---MPLS_backbone (40gig)    (Here you
    see the devices collapsed) <br /><br />apologies for any mistakes in the above
    but i did this quick :-).<br /><br />When discussing the latency in 2000/1 (Yes
    I noticed immediately and raised it) with my colleague Vendor Radio guys, they
    said &quot;You IP guys will just never get a handle on how radio is working&quot;...
    I said then it was unacceptable. Glad to see they learned.

  html: "but one simple question...why my IP packets got latency starting from ~150ms\
    \ to ??? and when i phone someone via UMTS (only Voide but also videophone) i\
    \ dont register any latency ? <br /><br />I don\xB4t how a phone handles the video...but\
    \ i assume that the same SGSN/GGSN and so on combo is used as for data ?"

  html: voice doesn&#39;t go to SGSN/GGSN. The voice equivalents are  MSC (2.5/3g)
    MSS/MGW(3g/hsdpa inc VOIP) and there isn&#39;t yet specified for LTE any voice
    solution ;-) -- some proposals are One Voice AKA IMS Lite, IMS itself, CS Callback
    OR VOLGA (Voice of LTE Generic Access)<br /><br />afaik, Voice and data use different
    radio channels (Logical/Physical). Voice is continuous and data is bursty so switches
    channels.

  html: I have had good luck with Verizon, latency around 200 ms. Bad luck with ATT
    though and from what I have read in USA Today it&#39;s because of the IPHONE crushing
    their network. A lot has to do with signal strength and location of the antenna.

  html: I don&#39;t know these technologies specifically, but I did a course in coding
    theory not that long ago where radio type environments came up. Since you&#39;re
    more likely to get<br />whole chains of errors or missing stuff in a radio type
    link than the single bit errors<br />you get in most other contexts, one approach
    (also used on CDs) is to send one bit<br />each of a bunch of codewords, then
    another bit of each, then another, and so on. so if you lose multiple bits in
    a row all that happens is you&#39;ve slighting damaged each of several different
    codewords and can recover them all. However, this approach massively increases
    serialization of any single codeword. <br /><br />As I say, this may have nothing
    whatever to do with the problem you are seeing.

  html: latency is, for the most part, due to packet processing as it goes through
    the mobile network.  lots of magic to make this stuff work. it is getting better
    as fewer devices are required to process traffic but until LTE expect up to 300ms.
    <br /><br />a quick google search turned this up<br /><br />http://disruptivewireless.blogspot.com/2008/07/latency-in-mobile-more-needs-to-be-done.html

  html: Looks like this is not relevant; it describes startup latency. With GPRS and
    UMTS you&#39;re encountering latency on every packet.

  html: I get 92ms as we speak.<br /><br />I&#39;ve worked with GGSNs and other parts
    of the mobile data network, and the delay is not in the network (between GGSN
    and NodeB). I would think it&#39;s due to the encoding/decoding of the radio signal
    what with the spread spectrum and signal bouncing. It would be interesting to
    know in which direction the signal is slowest.<br /><br />Also, it&#39;s good
    to keep in mind that the uplink speed is much slower than the downlink speed.<br
    /><br />But I never worked with the radio parts, so I don&#39;t know any details.
