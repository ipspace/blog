            <div class="comment-content">Not sure if my issue is related to this. I had an issue with EEM SNMP detector on. It failed to work after a few days. I had to remove all the event manager applet and reconfigure them to get it working again.<br /><br />I tried the same config on both 4500 and 3560 switches. Same problem.  :(</div>
