For DMVPN phase2, this wont work as the spokes need the actual tunnel IP address of the other spokes as next-hop for direct spoke to spoke communication<br />2. typically the spokes would already have a default route towards their ISP for internet access. <br /><br />Swap<br />#19804",

      "html": "An alternative, for example if we are using an IOS that do not support this feature or we are using another vendor, could be to MaxAge all the LSA&#39;s from the Hub increasing the transmit delay to 3600 seconds. However, the adjacency will be broken due to &quot;too many retransmissions&quot; , to avoid that we should increase the retransmit interval to a high value in order to maintain the adjacency up.<br /><br />So, the configuration in the Hub would be:<br /><br />interface <br />ip ospf retransmit-interval 6000  <br />ip ospf transmit-delay 3600  <br /><br />Best Regards.  <br /><br /><br />",
