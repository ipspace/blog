      "html": "Hi,<br />My query is regarding the control plane policing in 6500 switch. I have implemented CoPP in 65500 with different rate limits higher than the actual required for different classes of control plane traffic. I wish to tune this value for a near realistic one.<br />The show policy-map control-plane detail gives me the peak bps for each class for hardware counters (Hardware CoPP). <br />Whereas the software counters are displaying only the total number of bytes forwarded till now and last 5 minutes rate for each class of traffic.<br /><br />Is there anyway to find out the peak bps of the traffic forwarded by software CoPP for each class?<br />Can we be able to find/calculate the peak bps using the statistics available in the software counter display?",
