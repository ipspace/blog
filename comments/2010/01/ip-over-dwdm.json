Much cheaper to start up, and (and this is major) pure passive equipment options on short distance (short distance : theoretically 20km, practically 40km, and you might get lucky at 50km, with the new sfp&#39;s that should go on sale this year that&#39;s supposed to get closer to 100 km).<br /><br />The optics come in 8 colors, and are very cheap indeed. And I can&#39;t overemphasize the advantage that passive equipment is : no power required, no power failures.",
