Hence the question since the live session is during EST business hours.<br /><br />The second question is how would I pay for access to the recorded version? Would I simply sign up for the Datacenter webinar scheduled for tomorrow and then have the details for the recorded version e-mailed to me (similar to the Internetwork Expert model) ?<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />Sanjeev.",
