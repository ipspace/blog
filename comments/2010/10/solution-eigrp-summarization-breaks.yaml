  html: Oh, it was fun  8-) I knew immediately who it was, but couldn&#39;t resist
    writing the &quot;mistery contributor&quot; lead-in.

  html: '&quot;All traffic still flows through the hub (as dictated by the IP routing
    table).&quot;<br /><br />I guess this could be considered accurate in a sense
    but the way it&#39;s worded would lead to wrong assumptions. i.e. That the RIB
    is authoritative in DMVPN networks. It&#39;s not. NHRP is. <br /><br />In a DMVPN
    phase 3 network the routing table on the spoke still always shows the hub as the
    next hop but traffic actually flows via the spoke to spoke tunnel becuase NHRP
    will affect a change in CEF once the prefix is resolved via NHRP. If you were
    to compare the routing table in your &quot;hub only&quot; summarized scenario
    to the routing table in a phase 3 DMVPN network they would be the same but the
    traffic flow would not. <br /><br />The key to phase 3 is the NHRP redirect where
    the hub will tell the spoke to resolve(send NHRP resolution request) for some
    prefix X because the hub noticed that the first packet came and left the hub on
    an mGRE tunnel with the same NHRP network ID(likely the same tunnel interface
    unless it&#39;s a multi-tier DMVPN network)'

  html: While everything your write is absolutely correct, my blog post discusses
    the Phase 2 DMVPN (as indicated in the headline and a few times throughout the
    text), so my statement is still perfectly accurate.<br /><br />And while we&#39;re
    nitpicking - the only authoritative structure is the CEF table, which is built
    from RIB and augmented by the NHRP cache.

  html: haha, fair enough. I was trying to stick to the control plane only so didn&#39;t
    bring up CEF. Never been here before so I did not notice you were the owner of
    the blog and likely already knew.

  html: Hi all,<br />I was skeptical about the route summarization thing. If you make
    a summary from the hub that summarize the routes from the spokes or same summary
    from the spoke that will be sent to hub, that&#39;s logical that it will became
    the next hop of the spoke since it&#39;s the way it work, and only the hub is
    reponsible for advertisement of routes in the DMVPN.<br />Now, if you make a summary
    that concerns only the spoke network it work:<br />I made a small test, 1 hub,
    2 spoke. 10.[X].0.0 for each as private subnet. look at the spoke conf that advertise
    the summary:<br />interface Loopback0<br /> ip address 10.2.0.1 255.255.255.0<br
    />!<br />interface Loopback1<br /> ip address 10.2.1.1 255.255.255.0<br />!<br
    />int tun0<br />ip add 1.1.1.2 255.255.255.0<br />!<br />router eigrp 65000<br
    /> network 1.1.1.0 0.0.0.255<br /> network 10.2.0.0 0.0.0.255<br /> network 10.2.1.0
    0.0.0.255<br /> no auto-summary<br />!  <br /><br />The summary:<br />int tun0
    ! the dmvpn tunnel int<br /> ip summary-address eigrp 65000 10.2.0.0 255.255.0.0
    5<br /><br />Now, let&#39;s check what happens on the other spoke (same happen
    on the hub).<br /><br />R3#clear ip nhr ! clearing the nhrp cache<br />R3#sh ip
    cef 10.2.1.0<br />10.2.0.0/16, version 29, epoch 0 !see, the summary is installed,
    and point to my spoke tun as next hop<br />0 packets, 0 bytes<br />  via 1.1.1.2,
    Tunnel0, 0 dependencies<br />    next hop 1.1.1.2, Tunnel0<br />    invalid adjacency     !
    invalid since next hop cef is glean (normal)<br />R3#sh ip cef 1.1.1.2 <br />1.1.1.0/24,
    version 19, epoch 0, attached, connected<br />0 packets, 0 bytes<br />  via Tunnel0,
    0 dependencies<br />    valid glean adjacency (glean, as expected)<br /><br />now,
    let&#39;s check the ping, you&#39;ll see it work:<br />R3#ping 10.2.1.1<br /><br
    />Type escape sequence to abort.<br />Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.2.1.1,
    timeout is 2 seconds:<br />!!!!!<br />Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip
    min/avg/max = 28/33/44 ms<br />R3#sh ip cef 10.2.1.0<br />10.2.0.0/16, version
    29, epoch 0<br />0 packets, 0 bytes<br />  via 1.1.1.2, Tunnel0, 0 dependencies<br
    />    next hop 1.1.1.2, Tunnel0<br />    valid adjacency<br />R3#sh ip cef 1.1.1.2
    <br />1.1.1.2/32, version 31, epoch 0, connected<br />0 packets, 0 bytes<br />  via
    1.1.1.2, Tunnel0, 0 dependencies<br />    next hop 1.1.1.2, Tunnel0<br />    valid
    adjacency<br /><br /><br /><br /> 8-)

  html: 'To summarize: you can always summarize spoke (or per-site) routes advertised
    into DMVPN. Absolutely true.'

  html: I was digging a bit in this DMVPN stuff, and I saw that on the DMVPN Phase
    3, one of the improvements is allowing route summarization, so if I&#39;m correct,
    the thing is that even with a 0.0.0.0/0 summary learnt through the router, the
    spoke will get a NHRP redirect from the HUB for the destination it tried to reach,
    and after that NHRP shortcut process is taking precedence over the FIB of the
    router, right ?
