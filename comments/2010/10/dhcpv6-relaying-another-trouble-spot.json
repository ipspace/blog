Another option we thought about was to use a new relay option (see the RAAN draft).<br /><br />Bulk lease query is also another way of recovering state at the PE.<br />Markus and I wrote a draft at one point suggesting solutions to this problem:<br />http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-stenberg-v6ops-pd-route-maintenance-00<br /><br />in my view the &#39;cleanest&#39; approach would be for the CPE to run some sort of &quot;BFD echo&quot; to discover lost forwarding state at the PE and reset its DHCP client state machine.",
