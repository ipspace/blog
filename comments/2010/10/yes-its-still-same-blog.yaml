  html: The design is not bad, it looks more like one page compred to the old design
    which looked a bit like a combination of several &quot;boxes&quot; - but I&#39;m
    not a big fan of the color brown for a web page, I liked the decent blue of the
    old design.<br />Another thing which doesn&#39;t look so good is the font for
    the headlines, it has a pretty large space between the letters (compared to the
    space between the words).

  html: nice and cool Ivan! <br />Brown is unusual for a web page, but nothing to
    worry about, still prefectly readable.<br /><br />so long life to IosHints 2.0

  html: Could use a few pixels of left margin. Very flush in Safari. A bit hard to
    read.

  html: Have to agree, spend a few pixel on left side. But good readability on my
    iPad. <br />:-) And no footer bar :-)

  html: Do you have &quot;left margin&quot; problem on iPad? Or is it also on other
    platforms? The content is auto-centered, so it works quite well as soon as the
    screen resolution is above 1024 x 768 (the page is 1020 pixels wide).<br /><br
    />I will definitely implement an iPad specific fix 8-)

  html: Safari on my MacBook or iPad does the same. 1280x800 on my MacBook.  If I
    make the window fullscreen, it does center giving some space to the margin.

    professional level. Congratulation.

    i do a select-all/CTRL-A:<br />&quot;Ioshints <br />Internetworking perspectives
    by Ivan Pepelnjak<br /><br />&quot;<br />The above was very much visible (on the

    the left sidebar is pushed all the way to the left. Will add a few pixels there.'

    had completely free hands and came up with something that I liked (and implemented).

  html: The designer replaced that text with the logo (left) and &quot;smallprint&quot;
    on the right, which I decided to keep within the background image (it&#39;s hard
    to get good-looking small fonts across browsers).<br /><br />The original text
    is still there (in the background colors) in case someone disables image loading
    or CSS.<br /><br />If you think the Ctrl/A behavior is too annoying, I could move
    the header picture in front of the text.

  html: No that&#39;s okay, thanks. That was just my way of testing the new look.<br
    /><br />However, you might want to move the rock climbing pic towards north. Frankly,
    seldom readers scroll till the end of the page.

  html: Good design. Its easy to read. Even though im not normally a fan of brown,
    it gives the site a nice feel when its as subtle as it is. It looks great on my
    iPad as well. Good job.
