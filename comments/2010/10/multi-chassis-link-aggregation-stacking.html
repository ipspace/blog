            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Avaya/Nortel have greats solutions for dual (or more) chassis aggregation. Their switches are stackable on all series, most of them with more than 180Gbps between stack units via stack-cross cables. <br /><br />In dual chassi redundancy, they have Multilink Trunking technologies (MLT is like Etherchannel). MLT have various flavors, like:<br /><br />SLT - Single Link Trunking - triangle topology with dual Core switches and one third, dual homed. The connection is single to each core.<br /><br />SMLT - Split Multilink Trunking - Same as SLT, but now you can aggregate links between your third device (a distribution L2 switch) and the cores. Up to 8 x 10Gbps link aggregation per connection.<br /><br />RSMLT - Routed Split Multilink Trunking Same as SMLT, but now with L3 (OSPF added).<br /><br />All this more features like SLPP - Simple Loop Prevention Protocol - provides active protection against Layer 2 network loops on a per-VLAN basis. SLPP uses a lightweight hello packet mechanism to detect network loops. SLPP packets are sent using Layer 2 multicast and a switch will only look at its own SLPP packets or at its peer SLPP packets. It will ignore SLPP packets from other parts of the network. Sending hello packets on a per VLAN basis allows SLPP to detect VLAN based network loops for un-tagged as well as tagged IEEE 802.1Q VLAN link configurations.<br /><br />Well, that is it.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">In my experience, about 4 years ago, SMLT with DMLT (Nortel&#39;s MLAG) proved very unstable. When the switch stacks &#39;broke up&#39; due to the primary switch crashing a loop is formed and then whole thing falls apart.<br /><br />Perhaps things have imporved since then.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">agree with Ahmed.<br />for us it was even more painful: we have migrated from SMLT which really falls apart when one of the switches fails to MSTP (due to new Enterasys switches, which are very primitive in terms for features) only to find that Nortel was so impressed with SMLT, that some bugs were left unpatched in MSTP...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;ve been out of NT for a long time so I shouldn&#39;t be too biased. I have experienced the pain of earlier 3.x and 4.x releases and numerous SMLT bugs. They were particularly irritating because they were not obvious until something very specific happened. Most of them involved runaway CPU usage or failure when the master in a stack changed under certain conditions. Having said that, the 5.x and 6 releases are great with SMLT and for a campus scenario we will be looking at RSMLT to push L3 out to some edges.<br /><br />A major difference between VSS and the nt/avaya ERS products is that with ERS and SMLT, each chassis has an active CPU with a distributed control plane over the set of 2-4 chassis in a cluster. Of course, a redundant CPU is there as well in each chassis and support hot standby IIRC. In VSS (at least initially when I looked at it) you could only have 1 Sup in each chassis (ISSU support for example) and a wide variety of things render your cat6500 non-VSS capable (non-E chassis, WAN and most app/services modules, anything older than DFC3C, etc.) hopefully nobody will buy a cat6500 VSS and instead will go to Nexus.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Alcatel-Lucent has a different way of implementing MC-LAG (as they call it). In their implementation, an election process between MC-LAG peers decides which will be the Master; the other one becomes the Standby. The election is conducted using proprietary MC-LAG Control Packets. All the links from CE device to MC-LAG Standby device goes down while the links from CE to MC-LAG Master remain UP. LACP is required between CE and MC-LAG devices. <br /><br />It works very much like VRRP.</div>
