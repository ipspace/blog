      "html": "The interfame gap isn&#39;t there for benefit of the sending station, nor is it there to reduce collisions.<br /><br />Quoting Rich Seifert (who wrote that part of the specification):<br /><br />&quot;the purpose of the IFG is to allow receivers time to &quot;recover&quot; after reception of a frame (e.g., finish DMA operations, post status, adjust buffer pointers, etc.). This time is needed in both half- and full-duplex mode equally&quot;<br /><br />IFG doesn&#39;t help with collisions because IFG != random backoff timer.  IFG is /always/ 96 bit times, so two shared-media stations who both have a frame queued will /always/ collide on the first try, after both having waiting the /same/ 96 bit times.  Collisions are not reduced.  It&#39;s CSMA/CD &lt;- Collision Detection, not Collision Avoidance.<br /><br />Note that the &quot;gap to avoid collision&quot; strategy does exist in 801.11-based networks with CSMA/CA (avoidance), where the IFG before a new sender comes on the air consists of both a fixed time AND a QoS-enabling/collision-avoiding roll of the dice.<br /><br />I mention the 802.11 scheme because it&#39;s clever:  high priority packets roll a die with (say) 4 sides, resulting in a delay of 0-3 units.  Low priority packets roll a die with (say) 16 sides, resulting in a delay of 0-15 units.  The probability is that your voice frame will hit the air before your ftp frame, even though they are being broadcast onto a shared media (air) by different and uncoordinated radios.<br /><br />IPG has been eliminated in 802.11n with frame aggregation.  A sending station is now allowed to stream a number frames back-to-back-to-back.  This strategy is a huge improvement to both latency and throughput in a shared media environment.  On a full-duplex link the effect would be less dramatic.<br /><br />FA can be a problem for voice, however.  If the voice frame loses the dice roll, then he has to wait for a whole stack of FTP frames before he gets to roll for airtime again.",

      "html": "Thank you for the explanation. Looks like we&#39;ve traded bandwidth for simpler/cheaper silicon. Makes perfect sense.<br /><br />On the collision debate: in a coaxial cable, one bit @ 10 Mbps ~= 20 meters. 96 bit times is thus almost 2 km. The IFG thus (probably) ensures that a workstation that has just finished transmitting a frame will not compete with others for the next frame slot as there&#39;s almost no chance of collision if someone else starts transmitting as soon as the carrier is gone from the cable.",

      "html": "Ivan, thank you for the effort you put into your blog.  I&#39;m happy to be able to give a little something back.<br /><br />Actually, any time that two stations have a frame queued, they&#39;re /guaranteed/ to collide.<br /><br />One station might start to transmit &quot;early&quot; (perspective matters here) because:<br />- he&#39;s cheating<br />- his clock is slightly broken<br />- his position on the cable makes the transmission &quot;just appear&quot; early relative to somebody else<br />- ?<br /><br />No matter the reason, if another station has a frame queued (there&#39;s a race for wire time), that 2nd station /will/ transmit.  Even after somebody else has started, the 2nd guy will force a collision.  There&#39;s no &quot;collision avoidance&quot; here.<br /><br />The rationale is to force stations into the (extended) random backoff interval, rather than allow a station with a slightly too-fast clock to dominate the link.",
