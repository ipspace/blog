I think this idea did not pop up until now, because there is absolutely no need for a mechanism like that - NAT and dynamic allocations tried to preserve v4 space, what&#39;s the excuse now? :) <br /><br />I understand someone will try to tie to legacy practice, but can&#39;t we educate people and hopefully prevent that?",

      "html": "It is great reading your blog and see what challenge you will encounter next. ;-)<br /><br />With regards to DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation. The problem we tried to solve was basically to replace a fax message from the ISP to the customer. The delegated prefix was expected to have a long lifetime, perhaps equal to the length of the contract the customer has with the ISP.<br />In any case the prefix lifetime is independent of the state upstream link and should be valid until it&#39;s lifetime expires regardless.<br /><br />DHCPv6 PD does support changing prefixes, you can delegate two prefixes, an old and a new with different lifetimes and let the old time out over a few hours.<br />It is not entirely trivial to &quot;flash&quot; renumber an IPv6 network. E.g. it will break existing sessions, ND doesn&#39;t let you set the valid lifetime to less than 2h, the user might have manually configured routers in a more complex network and so on...<br /><br />On link-state change on the WAN interface, the DHCPv6 client should confirm (through a renew message) that the prefix delegated is still valid. That it doesn&#39;t get the link state change through the Dialer interface does indeed sound like a bug.",

Hence the thought that perhaps you could share some insight on the issue of subnets v/s VLANs to enlighten your readers! (Even if you/others happen to have some links to share, that&#39;d be great too!)",

It&#39;s always nice to know the exact context in which a particular feature was designed.<br /><br />I was also not (yet) aware of the ND limits; they would indeed make a &quot;flash renumber&quot; (during which you&#39;d obviously lose all the sessions like I do every morning at 10:30 when my beloved ISP clears my PPPoE IPv4 session) impossible.<br /><br />The DHCPv6 problem goes beyond the dialer interface.
