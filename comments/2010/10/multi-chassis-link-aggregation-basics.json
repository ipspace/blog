As you rightly said &quot;understand what happens if the switch hosting the control plane fails&quot; or even a downstream switch for that matter.

      "html": "Hey, with regards to IRF, basically you can cluster any switch with a 10Gb/s interface on it, with the following general guidelines:<br />Chassis (12500, 9500, 7500): Currently up to 2 devices can be clustered.  Rumor is that will be increased to 4 in the future.<br />5820: Up to 9 devices can be clustered<br />5800, 5500, 5120: Up to 8 devices can be clustered<br /><br />Certain mixed devices can be clustered using IRF, specifically 5820&#39;s and 5800&#39;s.<br /><br />IRF Clustering is fully stateful, and supports basically all the regular switch featuresets.  With regards to STP, an environment that uses all IRF on the Core or Aggregation devices can remove STP from the environment, and use LACP to provide path redundancy instead.<br /><br />I believe that the MSR routers support IRF as well, but I haven&#39;t configured it myself.",

      "html": "I believe that Arista&#39;s MLAG works very in a very similar fashion to Cisco&#39;s vPC, right down to aligning L3 gateway selection to avoid hairpinning routed traffic. It&#39;s supposed to work with any LACP-capable host or switch downstream, but I don&#39;t if the control-plane communication between the MLAG peers is proprietary or not. In practice though I can&#39;t see a big advantage for a standards-based approach there as you&#39;re unlikely to ever have a MLAG/vPC/etc. landing on dissimilar switches from the same vendor, let alone different vendors.",
