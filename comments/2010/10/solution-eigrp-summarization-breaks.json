      "html": "&quot;All traffic still flows through the hub (as dictated by the IP routing table).&quot;<br /><br />I guess this could be considered accurate in a sense but the way it&#39;s worded would lead to wrong assumptions. i.e. That the RIB is authoritative in DMVPN networks. It&#39;s not. NHRP is. <br /><br />In a DMVPN phase 3 network the routing table on the spoke still always shows the hub as the next hop but traffic actually flows via the spoke to spoke tunnel becuase NHRP will affect a change in CEF once the prefix is resolved via NHRP. If you were to compare the routing table in your &quot;hub only&quot; summarized scenario to the routing table in a phase 3 DMVPN network they would be the same but the traffic flow would not. <br /><br />The key to phase 3 is the NHRP redirect where the hub will tell the spoke to resolve(send NHRP resolution request) for some prefix X because the hub noticed that the first packet came and left the hub on an mGRE tunnel with the same NHRP network ID(likely the same tunnel interface unless it&#39;s a multi-tier DMVPN network)",

If you make a summary from the hub that summarize the routes from the spokes or same summary from the spoke that will be sent to hub, that&#39;s logical that it will became the next hop of the spoke since it&#39;s the way it work, and only the hub is reponsible for advertisement of routes in the DMVPN.<br />Now, if you make a summary that concerns only the spoke network it work:<br />I made a small test, 1 hub, 2 spoke. 10.[X].0.0 for each as private subnet. look at the spoke conf that advertise the summary:<br />interface Loopback0<br /> ip address 10.2.0.1 255.255.255.0<br />!<br />interface Loopback1<br /> ip address 10.2.1.1 255.255.255.0<br />!<br />int tun0<br />ip add 1.1.1.2 255.255.255.0<br />!<br />router eigrp 65000<br /> network 1.1.1.0 0.0.0.255<br /> network 10.2.0.0 0.0.0.255<br /> network 10.2.1.0 0.0.0.255<br /> no auto-summary<br />!  <br /><br />The summary:<br />int tun0 ! the dmvpn tunnel int<br /> ip summary-address eigrp 65000 10.2.0.0 255.255.0.0 5<br /><br />Now, let&#39;s check what happens on the other spoke (same happen on the hub).<br /><br />R3#clear ip nhr ! clearing the nhrp cache<br />R3#sh ip cef 10.2.1.0<br />10.2.0.0/16, version 29, epoch 0 !see, the summary is installed, and point to my spoke tun as next hop<br />0 packets, 0 bytes<br />  via 1.1.1.2, Tunnel0, 0 dependencies<br />    next hop 1.1.1.2, Tunnel0<br />    invalid adjacency     ! invalid since next hop cef is glean (normal)<br />R3#sh ip cef 1.1.1.2 <br />1.1.1.0/24, version 19, epoch 0, attached, connected<br />0 packets, 0 bytes<br />  via Tunnel0, 0 dependencies<br />    valid glean adjacency (glean, as expected)<br /><br />now, let&#39;s check the ping, you&#39;ll see it work:<br />R3#ping 10.2.1.1<br /><br />Type escape sequence to abort.<br />Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.2.1.1, timeout is 2 seconds:<br />!!!!!<br />Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 28/33/44 ms<br />R3#sh ip cef 10.2.1.0<br />10.2.0.0/16, version 29, epoch 0<br />0 packets, 0 bytes<br />  via 1.1.1.2, Tunnel0, 0 dependencies<br />    next hop 1.1.1.2, Tunnel0<br />    valid adjacency<br />R3#sh ip cef 1.1.1.2 <br />1.1.1.2/32, version 31, epoch 0, connected<br />0 packets, 0 bytes<br />  via 1.1.1.2, Tunnel0, 0 dependencies<br />    next hop 1.1.1.2, Tunnel0<br />    valid adjacency<br /><br /><br /><br /> 8-)",
