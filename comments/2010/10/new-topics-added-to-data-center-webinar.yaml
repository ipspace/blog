  html: Hi Ivan,<br />          I am wondering if it would be possible to access a
    recorded version of your webinar? The reason for this question is because we do
    not allow Webex here.<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br />Sanjeev.

  html: Of course that would be possible, but the recording is still streamed from
    Webex server, so the requirements are not much different from the live Webex session.

  html: Thanks Ivan, appreciate the prompt response. It would not be an issue to stream
    it at home for me but I cannot do so at work. Hence the question since the live
    session is during EST business hours.<br /><br />The second question is how would
    I pay for access to the recorded version? Would I simply sign up for the Datacenter
    webinar scheduled for tomorrow and then have the details for the recorded version
    e-mailed to me (similar to the Internetwork Expert model) ?<br /><br />Thanks
    again,<br />Sanjeev.

  html: Simply sign up for the next session (November 18th), when you get the registration
    e-mail reply to it and tell me who you are ;) We&#39;ll figure out the rest.
