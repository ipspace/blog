  html: It has been 6 years since your post. I would think that ISPs have caught up
    with TE tunnel EXP based class queuing. I would like to know what ISPs are doing
    now with the classes queuing. There are only 8 classes. Maybe one class is in
    the LLC queue and that class should only be given to traffic engineering tunnel
    subpool reserved tunnel heads.
