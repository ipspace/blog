            <div class="comment-content">It has been 6 years since your post. I would think that ISPs have caught up with TE tunnel EXP based class queuing. I would like to know what ISPs are doing now with the classes queuing. There are only 8 classes. Maybe one class is in the LLC queue and that class should only be given to traffic engineering tunnel subpool reserved tunnel heads.</div>
