            <div class="comment-content">I think Nortel was the first to provide this feature with what they called &quot;Split Multi-Link Trunking&quot; on the 8600.<br /><br />The concept is easy to sell to management and it works very well - until something goes wrong that is - then all hell breaks loose. As you rightly said &quot;understand what happens if the switch hosting the control plane fails&quot; or even a downstream switch for that matter. A number of years ago I rolled it out on a large campus and, a few catastrophic failures later, remove it all.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">You hit all the big points perfectly. Network Engineers like to push routing down to the TOR. Spanning tree is annoying. VSS is a hot mess. VPC isn&#39;t horrible, but it isn&#39;t a standard. There isn&#39;t an RFC or IEEE standard to read to make sure it is working correctly. The Juniper matrix is awesome, but expensive.<br /><br />Maybe I am a curmudgeon. I&#39;d like to think that it&#39;s just healthy paranoia.   :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">First off, you have to think of it as you are the SP providing a redundant service (VPLS/PW)through MCLA (or MC-LAG in ALU language). ALU use a proprietary protocol to sync the 2 nodes (acting as one node). this protocol, which runs over IP, should run over a protected (redundant and FRRed ) network as the nodes must always be in snyc (this is true for every MCLA solution). so MPLS fits nicely into the picture here also. there are much more details. try looking for MC-LAG.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">While by no means do I think that I have a large environment, Nortel&#39;s Split Multilink Trunk has been working just fine in my main campus. 17 data closets, a handful of physical servers, and a dozen VMWare hosts are all link aggregated to two 8600 switches with two to eight gig links in a Split Multilink Trunk<br /><br />I feel that someone needs to go to bat for Nortel / Avaya, since they were doing SMLT way before Cisco&#39;s VSS came out to play.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Here&#39;s a start:<br />http://www.trcnetworks.com/nortel/Data/Swiches/8600/pdfs/Split_multi_Link_Trunking.pdf<br /><br />...and a highlight:<br />&quot;Spanning Tree Protocol is disabled on the SMLT ports&quot;<br /><br />Not relying on STP for redundancy is one thing.  Switching it off is a whole other thing.  Deploy SMLT and hope that nobody ever loops two edge switches?  No thanks.<br /><br />Nortel has an extra twist: R(outed)SMLT, which is kind of like VPC + HSRP.  Except there&#39;s no virtual router IP.  Give your routers x.x.x.1 and x.x.x.2.  Configure .1 as the gateway on end systems.  If .1 fails, .2 assumes the dead router&#39;s address.<br /><br />If there&#39;s a power outage, and only .2 boots back up?  You&#39;re done.  (though there&#39;s a write-status-to-nvram fix for this)<br /><br />Come to think of it, it&#39;s a lot like vPC in that regard!</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Question about VSS style connections, is there any limitation to the distance (latency) that the 2 chassis can be apart from each other? Say you had a GigE ring between 3 sites and wanted to not route, but instead have 1 site use MCLA to the other 2 sites (the other 2 sites would be a VSS pair), would that work?</div>

Probably the best to start here (according Google :-)<br />http://h3c.com/portal/Technical_Support___Documents/Technical_Documents/<br />for all equipmen, then move to each swicth model if needed - seems IRF is supported on many models - 12k, 9500E, 7500E,58xx&#39;s. Could not see if IRF between different models is possible.<br /><br />Fairly thin on<br />http://h3c.com/portal/Products___Solutions/Technology/IRF/<br /><br />One of config guides can be found on<br />http://h3c.com/portal/download.do?id=1038276<br /><br />There seem to be no restriction on STP, in fact it seems this supports even MPLS and many other features..

            <div class="comment-content">vMotion works fine across subnets, but the VM you move across a L3 boundary (from the perspective of VM NIC) has to acquire a different IP address (or you have to use routing tricks).

            <div class="comment-content">Downstream loops can be prevented with two features:<br /><br />1) Simple Loop Protection Protocol - SMLT switches send probes down their SMLT links to the closet switch. If you see the SLPP hello packet return on another interface you know that you have a loop condition<br /><br />2) Control Plane limiting for Broadcast / Multicast traffic can be configured on a per port basis. I configure it on my SMLT links to down the interface and/or VLAN that is sending excess broadcast or multicast traffic<br /><br />In both solutions, this is configured on both SMLT switches with the trigger thresholds set to different levels (5 SLPP hello probes vs 50) so that only one side of the SMLT should be disabled during a downstream loop.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hey, with regards to IRF, basically you can cluster any switch with a 10Gb/s interface on it, with the following general guidelines:<br />Chassis (12500, 9500, 7500): Currently up to 2 devices can be clustered.  Rumor is that will be increased to 4 in the future.<br />5820: Up to 9 devices can be clustered<br />5800, 5500, 5120: Up to 8 devices can be clustered<br /><br />Certain mixed devices can be clustered using IRF, specifically 5820&#39;s and 5800&#39;s.<br /><br />IRF Clustering is fully stateful, and supports basically all the regular switch featuresets.  With regards to STP, an environment that uses all IRF on the Core or Aggregation devices can remove STP from the environment, and use LACP to provide path redundancy instead.<br /><br />I believe that the MSR routers support IRF as well, but I haven&#39;t configured it myself.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I believe that Arista&#39;s MLAG works very in a very similar fashion to Cisco&#39;s vPC, right down to aligning L3 gateway selection to avoid hairpinning routed traffic. It&#39;s supposed to work with any LACP-capable host or switch downstream, but I don&#39;t if the control-plane communication between the MLAG peers is proprietary or not. In practice though I can&#39;t see a big advantage for a standards-based approach there as you&#39;re unlikely to ever have a MLAG/vPC/etc. landing on dissimilar switches from the same vendor, let alone different vendors.</div>
