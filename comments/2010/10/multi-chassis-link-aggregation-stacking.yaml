  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Avaya/Nortel have greats solutions for dual (or more)
    chassis aggregation. Their switches are stackable on all series, most of them
    with more than 180Gbps between stack units via stack-cross cables. <br /><br />In
    dual chassi redundancy, they have Multilink Trunking technologies (MLT is like
    Etherchannel). MLT have various flavors, like:<br /><br />SLT - Single Link Trunking
    - triangle topology with dual Core switches and one third, dual homed. The connection
    is single to each core.<br /><br />SMLT - Split Multilink Trunking - Same as SLT,
    but now you can aggregate links between your third device (a distribution L2 switch)
    and the cores. Up to 8 x 10Gbps link aggregation per connection.<br /><br />RSMLT
    - Routed Split Multilink Trunking Same as SMLT, but now with L3 (OSPF added).<br
    /><br />All this more features like SLPP - Simple Loop Prevention Protocol - provides
    active protection against Layer 2 network loops on a per-VLAN basis. SLPP uses
    a lightweight hello packet mechanism to detect network loops. SLPP packets are
    sent using Layer 2 multicast and a switch will only look at its own SLPP packets
    or at its peer SLPP packets. It will ignore SLPP packets from other parts of the
    network. Sending hello packets on a per VLAN basis allows SLPP to detect VLAN
    based network loops for un-tagged as well as tagged IEEE 802.1Q VLAN link configurations.<br
    /><br />Well, that is it.

  html: In my experience, about 4 years ago, SMLT with DMLT (Nortel&#39;s MLAG) proved
    very unstable. When the switch stacks &#39;broke up&#39; due to the primary switch
    crashing a loop is formed and then whole thing falls apart.<br /><br />Perhaps
    things have imporved since then.

  html: 'agree with Ahmed.<br />for us it was even more painful: we have migrated
    from SMLT which really falls apart when one of the switches fails to MSTP (due
    to new Enterasys switches, which are very primitive in terms for features) only
    to find that Nortel was so impressed with SMLT, that some bugs were left unpatched
    in MSTP...'

  html: Am I wrong in thinking that TRILL as a replacement to {R|M}STP will solve
    the issue the issue of multiple link utilization across core switches or am I
    missing something?

  html: You&#39;re absolutely correct. TRILL or FabricPath or 802.1aq will solve a
    lot of STP problems.

  html: I cam across this http://www.isocore.com/mpls2010/program/abstracts.htm#mon3_1<br
    /><br />Kireeti Kompella of Juniper will present a tutorial on MPLS in the Cloud
    Computing and Data Centers in MPLS 2010 conference. Should be very interesting
    talk but unfortunately wont have access to it.

  html: I&#39;ve been out of NT for a long time so I shouldn&#39;t be too biased.
    I have experienced the pain of earlier 3.x and 4.x releases and numerous SMLT
    bugs. They were particularly irritating because they were not obvious until something
    very specific happened. Most of them involved runaway CPU usage or failure when
    the master in a stack changed under certain conditions. Having said that, the
    5.x and 6 releases are great with SMLT and for a campus scenario we will be looking
    at RSMLT to push L3 out to some edges.<br /><br />A major difference between VSS
    and the nt/avaya ERS products is that with ERS and SMLT, each chassis has an active
    CPU with a distributed control plane over the set of 2-4 chassis in a cluster.
    Of course, a redundant CPU is there as well in each chassis and support hot standby
    IIRC. In VSS (at least initially when I looked at it) you could only have 1 Sup
    in each chassis (ISSU support for example) and a wide variety of things render
    your cat6500 non-VSS capable (non-E chassis, WAN and most app/services modules,
    anything older than DFC3C, etc.) hopefully nobody will buy a cat6500 VSS and instead
    will go to Nexus.

  html: Alcatel-Lucent has a different way of implementing MC-LAG (as they call it).
    In their implementation, an election process between MC-LAG peers decides which
    will be the Master; the other one becomes the Standby. The election is conducted
    using proprietary MC-LAG Control Packets. All the links from CE device to MC-LAG
    Standby device goes down while the links from CE to MC-LAG Master remain UP. LACP
    is required between CE and MC-LAG devices. <br /><br />It works very much like
    VRRP.
