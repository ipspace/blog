  html: This whitepaper give a reasonable overview of the deployment options:<br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6553/whitepaper_C11-472610.html<br
    /><br />A relay will snoop the PD options and should install static routes when
    a prefix is delegated through the relay. Another option we thought about was to
    use a new relay option (see the RAAN draft).<br /><br />Bulk lease query is also
    another way of recovering state at the PE.<br />Markus and I wrote a draft at
    one point suggesting solutions to this problem:<br />http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-stenberg-v6ops-pd-route-maintenance-00<br
    /><br />in my view the &#39;cleanest&#39; approach would be for the CPE to run
    some sort of &quot;BFD echo&quot; to discover lost forwarding state at the PE
    and reset its DHCP client state machine.

  html: Will you be able to shared the bug id? It would be nice to check whether it&#39;s
    a cross-release one (or whether the 15.0M behavior is a different bug).

  html: OK, so I&#39;ve checked. This isn&#39;t a bug it is a feature. Or lack of
    such. I&#39;ve escalated this internally and I expect that we will have full support
    for relay route injection in the latest branches soon. Currently it is in IOS
    XE, 12.2XN, 12.2SE.

  html: Thanks, Ole.  You had told me offline that it was 12.2SRE, but above you write
    12.2SE.  Can you clarify?<br /><br />Frank

  html: In PPPoE environments, it&#39;s common and usual for both the CPE and the
    BRAS to test the link with periodic PPP LCP Echo Requests/Replies.

  html: LCP Echo discovers L2 problems, not a missing static route on BRAS. There&#39;s
    also the &quot;dialer interface&quot; problem on Cisco IOS CPEs (see http://blog.ioshints.info/2010/10/dhcpv6-over-pppoe-total-disaster.html)

  html: Synchronous thinking ... I did exactly the same tests last week, also with
    12.2SRE2. Great results coming in tomorrow&#39;s blog post.

  html: Ivan:<br /><br />Can you test to see if static route insertion works with
    12.2(31)SB20, 12.2(33)SRE3, or 15.1(4)M using PPPoE?  Because it doesn&#39;t seem
    to work for me, and &quot;debug ipv6 dhcp&quot; and &quot;debug ipv6 relay&quot;
    and &quot;debug ipv6 dhcp detail&quot; show the external DHCPv6 server sending
    the PD, but there&#39;s no static route insertion.  I&#39;ve also used &quot;debug
    ipv6 routing&quot;.<br /><br />Frank
