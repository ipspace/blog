  html: 'Mark, thank you for spotting my typo. 3.0 is correct and here&#39;s the full
    story (it has nothing to do with version numbering): <br /> <br />When I started
    writing the description, I used &quot;Data Center 2.0&quot; as a joke on the 2.0-ish
    hype. However, it turns out that Cisco is already a step ahead of us all promoting
    Data Center 3.0 (whatever 2.0 was, obviously it was not good enough), so I decided
    to follow the leaders and renumber.'
