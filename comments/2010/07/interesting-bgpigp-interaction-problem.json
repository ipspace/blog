      "html": "Duh, BGP has been troubled from the very beginning :) Just recall BGP Wedgies, MED oscillations and RR/Confederation routing loops due to topology incongruency. However, the problem you described here has been known in BGP design from the very beginning - you should use a single IGP for entire AS, OR implement BGP confederation to scale your IGP. Taking a look into the original (old) RFC 1771 you will notice that AS definition clearly states <br /><br />&quot;Autonomous System is a set of routers under a single technical administration, using an interior gateway protocol and common metrics to route packets within the AS&quot;<br /><br />However, I doubt everyone pays attention to this defintion until he sees the effect of incomparable metrics in practice :)",

      "html": "The phrase &quot;at least in its BGP core&quot; is a good way to end the post.  Multiple IGPs aren&#39;t bad, in and of themselves.  In fact, one can use different protocols to do creative traffic engineering, create interesting regional topologies, etc.  As you know, the key is the &quot;administrative&quot; weight of each protocol, which defines their relative priority.  Under most circumstances this is all it takes.  That said, in a typical network it&#39;s almost certainly desirable to have a uniform IGP topology covering the core. Additional IGP protocols should probably be limited to internal networks with well defined borders, data center networks, or specific regional / aggregation networks.",

      "html": "Sometimes you need to use 2 IGP and BGP on the same router. Think about a router which is facing the internet. That router uses BGP to speak with the ISP\u00b4s routers. Also uses EIGRP instead of static routes to create a peer neighboring with them. And eventually, it uses OSPF into the private network. <br />This router has 1 interface into OSPF routing protocol, another one into BGP mixed up with EIGRP. It would be a RIB-Failure because of the double-use of 2 IGP + BGP. But it is necesary.<br />I set up this lab on my GNS3 and it works though It shows a rib failure.",
