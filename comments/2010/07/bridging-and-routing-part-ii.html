            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan, <br /><br />I&#39;ve tried to pay some attention to the TRILL technology (and went through Radia Perlman&#39;s web video you kindly pointed to a few days ago), and I do think that in the urge to please everyone on the RFC definition, there might still be a door open regarding the impact of physical errors. <br />In fact for what I&#39;ve understood the IS-IS adjacency between RBridges can cross non-TRILL enabled segments, making it somewhat different than Cisco&#39;s proposal of L2MP, but more universal.<br />As such I believe that if you happen to have a problem on the cloud between RBridges, knowing that that cloud will &quot;fail open&quot; (they are L2-based switches running some sort of STP), the risk for hello packets to flow through a storm caused by unidirectional links for instance may occur, but the network will have the erratic behaviour that we&#39;ve all seen during STP meltdowns. <br />I&#39;m perhaps pointing to a very corner case (I don&#39;t really think that ISIS hello&#39;s would be able to go through data plane of &quot;cloud&quot; switches maintaining ISIS adj for a while), but I&#39;d like, if you will, to have your comment/clarification on that.<br /><br />thank you very much<br /><br />Gustavo Novais</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I think Ethernet OAM&amp;PM is worth mentioning in the troubleshooting section. 802.3ah, 802.1ag and Y.1731.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Well, the idea that you could sparsely deploy TRILL bridges across your network and that they should handle whatever is thrown at them is (in my personal opinion) pure b******t that made TRILL significantly more complex than it should have been.<br /><br />If someone decides (in his infinite wisdom) to deploy STP-based switched network between TRILL RBridges, he&#39;ll suffer exactly the same consequences as someone deploying STP-based switched network between IS-IS routers. It works today and it will work with TRILL, but you&#39;ll experience  interesting nightmares in both cases.<br /><br />Obviously just my €0.002, I have no hands-on TRILL experience (but neither has anyone else).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Well, it is worth mentioning that these are more of &quot;Carrier Ethernet&quot; extensions, aiming at providing &quot;connection-oriented&quot; services (EVCs, etc). Not exactly the connectivity model that enterprise data-centers are looking for (plug-and-play, full-mesh), rather SP-centric model.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The above is an insightful comparison of bridging versus routing. <br />But what is really compared is the CURRENT bridging concept using spanning tree versus routing. Things (and minds)  are changing (slowly, as the dominant paradigm is that link state routing at layer two is almost perfect and some people think that no further evolution of bridging is possible beyond link state routing). <br />But the concept of bridging is evolving (see ARP Path aka Fastpath proposals at IEEE 802.1 repository, IEEE Communication Letters July 2011, HPSR 2011 conference and demos (Sigcom 2011, LCN 2010) so that while some characteristics of bridging persist, like guessing vs calculating, no predictability of the path, other disadvantages dissapear: shortest paths are obtained, all links can be used, link failure does not affect working links.<br />Simpler, reliable and powerful bridging is possible.</div>
