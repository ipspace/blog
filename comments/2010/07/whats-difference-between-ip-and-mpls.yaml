  html: I would mention a couple reasons why MPLS is used (e.g. so that P routers
    need not carry a global table, traffic engineering, etc.).

  html: A key difference between IP Forwarding and MPLS is the considerations that
    determine how a packet is assigned to an FEC. In MPLS, FECs can be many things
    like (same IP Prefix, IBGP next-hop etc) and also that FEC of a packet is determined
    only at the ingress of the MPLS network ... obviously explaining this would take
    a third of an MPLS book ;)

  html: In two words, I would say IP is &quot;connectionless&quot; while MPLS is &quot;connection-oriented&quot;

  html: No, &quot;connection-oriented&quot; has a completely different meaning. I&#39;ll
    get to that in one of the &quot;summer campfire&quot; blog posts.

  html: 'Fine, but I still stand for &quot;connection-oriented&quot; :) Maybe you
    think of some different meaning, but for me connection-oriented means the fact
    that MPLS creates LSPs and *maintains* their state across the network core. It&#39;s
    not &quot;truly&quot; connection-oriented in the sense that X.25 or ATM were,
    but in many senses very close, especially if you think of RSVP-TE.<br /><br />In
    my opinion, the &quot;connection-oriented&quot; nature is what makes the IP+MPLS
    hybrid so effective: connectionless service is encapsulated in loosely connetion-oriented
    transport.'

  html: 'Here some of advantages <br />1 ) mpls gives you more control on how traffic
    goes through the core: constraint lsp, bandwidth reservation etc<br />2)  LSP
    applied to whole core network and ip routing make decisions on each box. So you
    need only to control how traffic get into lsp on ingress router.<br />3) lsp fast
    re-routeing switch traffic in case of failure in milliseconds, comes near to sdh.  <br
    /><br />drawbacks <br />1) lack of ipv6 support  in control protocols RSVP-TE,
    LDP'

  html: '&gt;lsp fast re-routeing switch traffic in case of failure in milliseconds,
    comes near to sdh.<br /><br />In theory, yes - in practice this turns out to be
    difficult for the 10-15 L3VPN providers we deal with.  Two quick points about
    the idea - first, FRR being F depends on failure *detection* being quick for the
    milliseconds part to become true (there are a lot of poll-based rather than interrupt-based
    interfaces still out there, for example), and second, avoiding fate-sharing between
    primary and backup LSPs (which makes FRR useless) seems to be pretty difficult
    in large-scale production networks.'
