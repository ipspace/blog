            <div class="comment-content">Hello Ivan,  I have just had a look at a few pages regarding OTV, which I had no idea about until now.  I have found the following document by Cisco, it is quite interesting.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Mark.<br /><br />Enc.<br /><br />https://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps9441/ps9402/white_paper_c11-574984.html</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Cisco Live! breakout on OTV was also pretty good. If you have access to it, I&#39;d highly recommend it.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;m disappointed by this book so far.  The areas I went first were QoS, IPv4 multicast and NSF.<br /><br />QoS is wholly absent.<br /><br />Multicast is here, but seems fluffed out with introductory stuff, and is light on the Nexus-specific stuff that I needed, like the new to me PBR-based (policy route map) filtering of MSDP messages.  Further, the book (incorrectly, I think) suggests that BGP is a prerequisite to MSDP.<br /><br />NSF gets a two-paragraph mention of what it&#39;s there for.  No configuration/verification guidelines.  The text claims interoperability with &quot;most modern networking devices including IOS&quot;, without mentioning that NX-OS only supports the IEEE ratified flavor, leaving out in the cold the many versions of IOS that only speak the earlier Cisco-proprietary flavor.<br /><br />I confess that I&#39;m not far into the book, and thus far have only attempted to use it as a reference document.<br /><br />So far, all of the information I&#39;ve read here is either platform-independent (you have no business installing $500K devices if this is new to you), or it&#39;s the Nexus twist on an old trick, and is something new that I&#39;ve already stumbled my way through with the CLI&#39;s inbuilt help features.</div>
