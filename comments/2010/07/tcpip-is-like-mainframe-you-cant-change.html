            <div class="comment-content">And if software companies were committed to producing quality software then we would have less resistance to change. Microsoft is scared to change the IP stack, it took them 15 years to get it reliable. <br /><br />And the network has to adapt to cope, making it complex and less reliable.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Sorry no time for detailed comments at the moment, but it would be awesome to see a see discussion built around RFC1958/RFC3439 and how the emerging technologies (driven mainly by investment protection motive) violate many of the princinples outlined in the documents :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;m disappointed ... I expected a lengthy and interesting comment from you 8-)<br /><br />However, as I said, many of the emerging technologies have less to do with &quot;investment protection&quot; than with the &quot;we can&#39;t change our environment&quot; reality. For example, TRILL, OTV, 802.1aq and the like would be completely unnecessary if the servers/clients/sysadmins would stop behaving like the IP addresses are cast in stone.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Well I do expect to have some spare time tomorrow ;) As for &quot;we can&#39;t change something&quot; I think it normally translates to either:<br /><br />&quot;we spent $$$ on it and  now you telling us it sucks?! (CAPEX)&quot;  e.g. L2 based clustering or unroutable protocols<br /><br />or <br /><br />&quot;what, we have to pay that dude ANOTHER $$$ to support new stuff?! (OPEX)&quot; :) - e.g. changing plug-and-play behavior of Ethernet link to a routed network just to scale it.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Joe Touch had a hilarious presentation during INTAREA session at IETF78 few days ago, he wants to change ID stuff in IPv4. The title was &quot;Updated Specification of the IPv4 ID Field&quot;, https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-intarea-ipv4-id-update/ .<br /><br />Not to mention, the response from audience was &quot;brutal&quot; and the idea finally killed by Randy in his very own style. Hilarious (enjoyed it in some weird ways) :)</div>
