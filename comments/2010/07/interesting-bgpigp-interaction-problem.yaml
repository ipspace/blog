  html: Duh, BGP has been troubled from the very beginning :) Just recall BGP Wedgies,
    MED oscillations and RR/Confederation routing loops due to topology incongruency.
    However, the problem you described here has been known in BGP design from the
    very beginning - you should use a single IGP for entire AS, OR implement BGP confederation
    to scale your IGP. Taking a look into the original (old) RFC 1771 you will notice
    that AS definition clearly states <br /><br />&quot;Autonomous System is a set
    of routers under a single technical administration, using an interior gateway
    protocol and common metrics to route packets within the AS&quot;<br /><br />However,
    I doubt everyone pays attention to this defintion until he sees the effect of
    incomparable metrics in practice :)

  html: RFC? Is that the thing someone reads to you after everything else fails?  :-P

  html: I usually go even a bit further - access IGP (if you have one) and core IGP
    should not be linked. Flaps in access network have no business disrupting your
    core; they should end up in BGP.

  html: The phrase &quot;at least in its BGP core&quot; is a good way to end the post.  Multiple
    IGPs aren&#39;t bad, in and of themselves.  In fact, one can use different protocols
    to do creative traffic engineering, create interesting regional topologies, etc.  As
    you know, the key is the &quot;administrative&quot; weight of each protocol, which
    defines their relative priority.  Under most circumstances this is all it takes.  That
    said, in a typical network it&#39;s almost certainly desirable to have a uniform
    IGP topology covering the core. Additional IGP protocols should probably be limited
    to internal networks with well defined borders, data center networks, or specific
    regional / aggregation networks.

  html: "Sometimes you need to use 2 IGP and BGP on the same router. Think about a\
    \ router which is facing the internet. That router uses BGP to speak with the\
    \ ISP\xB4s routers. Also uses EIGRP instead of static routes to create a peer\
    \ neighboring with them. And eventually, it uses OSPF into the private network.\
    \ <br />This router has 1 interface into OSPF routing protocol, another one into\
    \ BGP mixed up with EIGRP. It would be a RIB-Failure because of the double-use\
    \ of 2 IGP + BGP. But it is necesary.<br />I set up this lab on my GNS3 and it\
    \ works though It shows a rib failure."

  html: And yet according to the Cisco approved design practice and covered in the
    Interconnecting Data Centers Using VPLS using two IGPs is acceptable. 1 for the
    IP/BGP to MPLS/LDP process and the other for all internal core non MPLS related
    traffic. Fun times

  html: Hi,<br /><br />         Was just reading the scenerio that u described above
    ....Have a little confusion ...You said &quot;E&quot; would learn that route from
    &quot;A&quot; via OSPF and &quot;D&quot; via EIGRP and to choose the best path
    it would use the METRIC ....Would it not user AD value prior to that ???? *DONT_KNOW*

  html: 'hi,<br />i second Vandana&#39;s comments. Can someone clear on this one since
    EIGRP Route summary/Internal EIGRP AD is superior than OSPF. '
