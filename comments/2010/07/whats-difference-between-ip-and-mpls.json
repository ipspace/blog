In MPLS, FECs can be many things like (same IP Prefix, IBGP next-hop etc) and also that FEC of a packet is determined only at the ingress of the MPLS network ... obviously explaining this would take a third of an MPLS book ;)",

      "html": "Fine, but I still stand for &quot;connection-oriented&quot; :) Maybe you think of some different meaning, but for me connection-oriented means the fact that MPLS creates LSPs and *maintains* their state across the network core. It&#39;s not &quot;truly&quot; connection-oriented in the sense that X.25 or ATM were, but in many senses very close, especially if you think of RSVP-TE.<br /><br />In my opinion, the &quot;connection-oriented&quot; nature is what makes the IP+MPLS hybrid so effective: connectionless service is encapsulated in loosely connetion-oriented transport.",

Two quick points about the idea - first, FRR being F depends on failure *detection* being quick for the milliseconds part to become true (there are a lot of poll-based rather than interrupt-based interfaces still out there, for example), and second, avoiding fate-sharing between primary and backup LSPs (which makes FRR useless) seems to be pretty difficult in large-scale production networks.",
