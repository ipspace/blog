            <div class="comment-content">interesting...I work for a large (by where I come from standards) mobile operator and one of the few things we learn&#39;t from experience and watching other markets and networks was: we had to have some sort of fair usage per user policies implemented.It worked/works very well because most of our users expectations (most are mobile users) were never raised too much and they are pretty much used to more when they need it.<br /><br />Our fixed broadband offering will also have varying levels of &#39;per_user&#39; bandwidth controls. i won&#39;t be shocked to see pcrf&#39;s, sce&#39;s and other fancy DPI &#39;equipment&#39; generally embraced by mobile data network operators being deployed by regular ISP&#39;s....more fun for the geeks I guess....</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Sadly enough many people commenting the previous post tend to think in the &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; emotional terms :) Must be more fun this way. Rarely I see anyone trying to re-think the existing internet service model (statistical multiplexing, flow fairness, flow congestion management, hierarchial addressing etc) and see if there is another way of doing things. <br /><br />There is an explanation, though. Modern Internet (&quot;modern&quot;, even though it technically roots in 80s) is so much built into the business processes, that making any drastic design changes becomes almost impossible. This is why we get all that weird stuff like TRILL or LISP as opposed to more &quot;technically advanced&quot; academic solutions that, however, do not satisfy the short-term &quot;ROI  requirements&quot;. So much more fun is living in the world of theoretical concepts than solving real-life &quot;boring&quot; engineering problems ;)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Per end-point (circuit/port/eMTA/subscriber) fairness that is aware of the current utilization at the pinch point and historical use of all downstream users is the best approach for the mass market. The light user should have priority for their occasional large download over the heavy user with sustained high network loads 24/7. To earn the support of users and deflect bad press, the SP needs to disclose the details of how the system works and will affect different users and applications. <br /><br />Even then, a large number of users will complain because they do not understand that their xMbps service is not a dedicated amount of throughput beyond the last mile. Or that the low per-Mbps price they pay is achieved thanks to oversubscription and statistical multiplexing, not just Moore&#39;s law or economies of scale. Not to mention that very little xDSL and FTTH gear is non-blocking in backplane or uplink and no cable network has a 1:1 ratio of total subscribed speeds to aggregate docsis channel capacity in the access portion.<br /><br />At the moment, there is plenty of good DPI hardware that can effectively handle 10Gbps+ in a few RU&#39;s. The problem is really in getting it setup with good policies that are as non-intrusive as possible. After all, if the stat is that only the top 1-5% of users are &quot;troublesome&quot; because of their sustained use, the rest of your users should never notice the solution. Many vendors are now focusing on improving the control plane for their DPI ecosystem to make it more aware of current congestion by feeding the control system data on congestion events up and down stream.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">It goes beyond &quot;short-term ROI requirements&quot;. The question is &quot;what can you change in reasonable timeframe?&quot;. You cannot change the workstations; it took IPv6 15 years to be semi-decently implemented and SCTP is only available on some Linux distributions. <br /><br />If you have to solve the problem in a few years, you have to solve it within the network.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">We&#39;re in almost total agreement; the minor point is that &quot;a large number of users will complain&quot;. They will not; they don&#39;t care as long as they can read e-mail, access Facebook or watch YouTube.<br /><br />However, you have to be prepared for a very vocal minority and use transparency and fairness to deflect them.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan, still murdering holy cows are we?  However, this time I fully agree with you and like Chief Vitalstatistix of Asterix fame, please don&#39;t expect the sky to fall on your head.<br />In a wireless environment radio spectrum is a scarce resource and one pimple faced kid downloading teenage fantasies via a base station kills the experience for the rest of the subs who also pay the same fees.  This is not equitable.<br />Most web browsing requires 128 kb/s and email 64 kb/s.  P2P requires 8 to 10 Mb/s.

            <div class="comment-content">Nice topic Ivan.<br />Here are some relevant links i had found in the past:<br /><br />http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/standards/a-fairer-faster-internet-protocol/0<br />http://www.zdnet.com/blog/ou/fixing-the-unfairness-of-tcp-congestion-control/1078<br />http://www.bobbriscoe.net/projects/refb/<br />http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-briscoe-tsvarea-fair-02<br /><br />imho, the biggest issue when trying to &quot;limit&quot; something is that the very few users that are causing the actual congestion are the ones that are the most active on social media and will complain on every chance they get.</div>
