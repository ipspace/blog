      "html": "Couple of additional points:<br /><br />- Interface cost<br /><br />- Zero-configuration vs. almost universally required some sort of manual-ish configuration (at least for IP)<br /><br />But, stepping back a bit, I am confused - why is there a comparison of routing with bridging? Why not just use whatever is more optimal in a particular circumstance? Surely there are some cases where bridging works better (or is the only option), some others where there is a choice and yet others where routing is the only option?<br /><br />This discussion really reminds me the eternal argument about &quot;which is better - IP VPN or VPLS?&quot;. The answer, in my opinion, is &quot;use that which makes sense in the particular circumstances&quot;.<br /><br />Than again, I may be missing something here.",

It can be designed to be fairly optimal by using hierarchical topology, multiple MST regions and bridge priorities. Agreed, this won&#39;t work in *all* circumstances, but when it does, cost savings often far outweigh the inconvenience.",
