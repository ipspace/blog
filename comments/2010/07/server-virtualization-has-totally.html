            <div class="comment-content">I completely agree that server virtualization is changing the data center significantly.  One issue I&#39;ve struggled with is that virtualized hosts that use VMotion require larger layer 2 domains than I&#39;d prefer.<br /><br />I did have a bit of expansion on the VMWare trunking issue.  Even when trunking to VMWare servers BPDU Guard and Portfast can be deployed.  The VMWare virtual switch doesn&#39;t participate in the spanning tree and there is no reason to delay bringing the interface up for to spanning tree states to change.  This is identical behavior to trunking to an HP physical server running Windows.  In these cases the only function the trunk interface provides is VLAN tagging.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I second that. <br />One important thing that needs to be mentioned over and over is that IMHO it is the shift of the responsibility that is the most important change over here. <br /><br />Now, we as &quot;pure&quot; technical personnel do not really care about the chain of responsibility in whole organization up to the CEO, however we start to care when we see that it doesn&#39;t work, simply because nobody from the management point of view is aware of this shift.<br /><br />One example in the traditional &quot;Vertical Tower Model&quot; of management structure employed in almost every big organizations -  servers belong to &quot;Server Management Tower&quot; and network to &quot;Network Management Tower&quot; and in no way they manage devices for each other, or have a common budget.<br /><br />F.e. the usual issues:<br />What happens if the VMswitch failes? <br />Who troubleshoots? <br />Who opens troubleshooting tickets to VMswitch provider? <br />Whose problem is it, really?<br />Who &quot;owns&quot; the VMswitch?<br /><br />If you answer all the questions above and create procedures around it, you will find out that you have changed the way your IT organization works so much, that you should go and rearrange the whole mgmt structure in a more horizontal way....</div>
