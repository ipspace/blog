  html: 'interesting...I work for a large (by where I come from standards) mobile
    operator and one of the few things we learn&#39;t from experience and watching
    other markets and networks was: we had to have some sort of fair usage per user
    policies implemented.It worked/works very well because most of our users expectations
    (most are mobile users) were never raised too much and they are pretty much used
    to more when they need it.<br /><br />Our fixed broadband offering will also have
    varying levels of &#39;per_user&#39; bandwidth controls. i won&#39;t be shocked
    to see pcrf&#39;s, sce&#39;s and other fancy DPI &#39;equipment&#39; generally
    embraced by mobile data network operators being deployed by regular ISP&#39;s....more
    fun for the geeks I guess....'

  html: Sadly enough many people commenting the previous post tend to think in the
    &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;
    emotional terms :) Must be more fun this way. Rarely I see anyone trying to re-think
    the existing internet service model (statistical multiplexing, flow fairness,
    flow congestion management, hierarchial addressing etc) and see if there is another
    way of doing things. <br /><br />There is an explanation, though. Modern Internet
    (&quot;modern&quot;, even though it technically roots in 80s) is so much built
    into the business processes, that making any drastic design changes becomes almost
    impossible. This is why we get all that weird stuff like TRILL or LISP as opposed
    to more &quot;technically advanced&quot; academic solutions that, however, do
    not satisfy the short-term &quot;ROI  requirements&quot;. So much more fun is
    living in the world of theoretical concepts than solving real-life &quot;boring&quot;
    engineering problems ;)

  html: Per end-point (circuit/port/eMTA/subscriber) fairness that is aware of the
    current utilization at the pinch point and historical use of all downstream users
    is the best approach for the mass market. The light user should have priority
    for their occasional large download over the heavy user with sustained high network
    loads 24/7. To earn the support of users and deflect bad press, the SP needs to
    disclose the details of how the system works and will affect different users and
    applications. <br /><br />Even then, a large number of users will complain because
    they do not understand that their xMbps service is not a dedicated amount of throughput
    beyond the last mile. Or that the low per-Mbps price they pay is achieved thanks
    to oversubscription and statistical multiplexing, not just Moore&#39;s law or
    economies of scale. Not to mention that very little xDSL and FTTH gear is non-blocking
    in backplane or uplink and no cable network has a 1:1 ratio of total subscribed
    speeds to aggregate docsis channel capacity in the access portion.<br /><br />At
    the moment, there is plenty of good DPI hardware that can effectively handle 10Gbps+
    in a few RU&#39;s. The problem is really in getting it setup with good policies
    that are as non-intrusive as possible. After all, if the stat is that only the
    top 1-5% of users are &quot;troublesome&quot; because of their sustained use,
    the rest of your users should never notice the solution. Many vendors are now
    focusing on improving the control plane for their DPI ecosystem to make it more
    aware of current congestion by feeding the control system data on congestion events
    up and down stream.

  html: It goes beyond &quot;short-term ROI requirements&quot;. The question is &quot;what
    can you change in reasonable timeframe?&quot;. You cannot change the workstations;
    it took IPv6 15 years to be semi-decently implemented and SCTP is only available
    on some Linux distributions. <br /><br />If you have to solve the problem in a
    few years, you have to solve it within the network.

  html: We&#39;re in almost total agreement; the minor point is that &quot;a large
    number of users will complain&quot;. They will not; they don&#39;t care as long
    as they can read e-mail, access Facebook or watch YouTube.<br /><br />However,
    you have to be prepared for a very vocal minority and use transparency and fairness
    to deflect them.

  html: Ivan, still murdering holy cows are we?  However, this time I fully agree
    with you and like Chief Vitalstatistix of Asterix fame, please don&#39;t expect
    the sky to fall on your head.<br />In a wireless environment radio spectrum is
    a scarce resource and one pimple faced kid downloading teenage fantasies via a
    base station kills the experience for the rest of the subs who also pay the same
    fees.  This is not equitable.<br />Most web browsing requires 128 kb/s and email
    64 kb/s.  P2P requires 8 to 10 Mb/s.  As George Orwell mentioned in 1984, some
    pigs are created more equal than others...

  html: Nice topic Ivan.<br />Here are some relevant links i had found in the past:<br
    /><br />http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/standards/a-fairer-faster-internet-protocol/0<br
    />http://www.zdnet.com/blog/ou/fixing-the-unfairness-of-tcp-congestion-control/1078<br
    />http://www.bobbriscoe.net/projects/refb/<br />http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-briscoe-tsvarea-fair-02<br
    /><br />imho, the biggest issue when trying to &quot;limit&quot; something is
    that the very few users that are causing the actual congestion are the ones that
    are the most active on social media and will complain on every chance they get.
