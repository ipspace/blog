Microsoft is scared to change the IP stack, it took them 15 years to get it reliable. <br /><br />And the network has to adapt to cope, making it complex and less reliable.",

I expected a lengthy and interesting comment from you 8-)<br /><br />However, as I said, many of the emerging technologies have less to do with &quot;investment protection&quot; than with the &quot;we can&#39;t change our environment&quot; reality. For example, TRILL, OTV, 802.1aq and the like would be completely unnecessary if the servers/clients/sysadmins would stop behaving like the IP addresses are cast in stone.",

(CAPEX)&quot;  e.g. L2 based clustering or unroutable protocols<br /><br />or <br /><br />&quot;what, we have to pay that dude ANOTHER $$$ to support new stuff?! (OPEX)&quot; :) - e.g. changing plug-and-play behavior of Ethernet link to a routed network just to scale it.",

The title was &quot;Updated Specification of the IPv4 ID Field&quot;, https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-intarea-ipv4-id-update/ .<br /><br />Not to mention, the response from audience was &quot;brutal&quot; and the idea finally killed by Randy in his very own style. Hilarious (enjoyed it in some weird ways) :)",
