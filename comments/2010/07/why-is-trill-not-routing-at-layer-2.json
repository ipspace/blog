The &quot;unknown mac address&quot; problem can be pretty serious. Nothing like sending lots of packets to an ip address with no mac address to start consuming some sort of router resource, whether it is CPU or some rate-limit for the gleans.<br /><br />Great blog, btw!",

      "html": "Ivan,<br />In this article you say the outer MAC changes as it traverses RBridges. In Cisco&#39;s &quot;proprietary&quot; implementation of TRILL (called FabricPath), that is not true.  With Cisco FabricPath, the outer MAC is that of the far end Edge bridge and does not change as it traverses RBridges in the core.  From a &quot;standards&quot; perspective, in reading the spec for 802.1aq (SPBM, the newer variant that uses mac-in-mac) there is no language I can see that says the outer MAC should change when passing through RBridges (correct me if you see otherwise).  This very different from L3 &quot;Routing&quot; behavior where the L2 destination address changes link by link.<br /><br />This further re-enforces your point that saying &quot;TRILL really is routing at Layer 2&quot;, while a cute and semi-accurate sound-bite, is not completely true when you begin to peel back the onion.<br /><br />Thanks for the link, Ivan.  I really appreciate that. <br /><br />Cheers,<br />Brad<br />  :)",

Therefore if a &quot;core&quot; RBridge has equal cost paths to an &quot;edge&quot; RBridge, it will be known ahead of time which of its links are included in those paths.  When a &quot;core&quot; RBridge receives a frame with a MAC of an edge bridge (the outer MAC) it will apply the ECMP logic and send traffic out each link on a per flow basis.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Brad",
