It&#39;s quite easy to pick up.<br /><br />I have been focused on system engineering for several years, but still tinker with code on a regular basis. Moving more into the network side these days. So I&#39;m fluent in TCL and system/router/switch configuration. You are right that it&#39;s rare to find someone like that.",

      "html": "The following statement is  wrong : <br /><br />Very few people know enough about programming and networking. Fluency in Tcl programming and Cisco router configuration is almost non-existent.<br /><br />There is a huge community of networking engineers and testers, both within and outside Cisco, whose bread and butter is programming for networking devices. (read : automation and regression of Cisco features). Apart from this, TCL is widely used for quick scripting of scaled configs, parsing output, etc. I am one of them.<br /><br />Now, whether these people are competent or enterprising enough to also write a book about what they do daily ? Probably not.",

However, I doubt your definition of &quot;huge&quot; is equal to mine.<br /><br />Next, let&#39;s focus on &quot;fluency&quot;. If you&#39;re smart enough to google for a few hours to find a Tcl example that looks close to what you need and hack it a bit to fit your needs, you&#39;re very far away from being fluent in Tcl. Most of the quick scripting &quot;solutions&quot; you write about are short hacks or slight modifications of existing examples.<br /><br />Just to give you an example: in every certification forum, you&#39;ll find a Tclsh script that pings numerous devices at once. Are you fluent in Tcl if you memorize the script and use it in your CCIE lab exam? You&#39;re very far from it.<br /><br />In my opinion, being fluent in a programming language means not having to open the documentation or google.com while writing a complex program. To be honest, I&#39;m very far away from being fluent in Tcl, as I don&#39;t use it on a daily basis.",

      "html": "Ivan,<br /><br />I agree with you, both on the ambiguity regarding the definition of huge, and on the definition of fluency in programming.<br /><br />Both the above caveats notwithstanding, there is still a large number of people who are fluent in TCL programming as well as know basic networking. They may not be CCIEs, or customer facing, but they do exist. They are probably hidden away in organizations&#39; testing departments, and do not communicate with the testing community in large, partly due to the fact the network testing is <br />* somewhat different from other forms of testing that are written about and discussed<br />* Is somewhat specialized, requiring higher effort to write about or discuss (for example, compared to a web testing)<br /><br />Apologies for the digression, but I just wanted to point out a &quot;latent force&quot; which is out there (here) :)",
