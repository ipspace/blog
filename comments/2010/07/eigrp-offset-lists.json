      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Can you really decrease the value of the delay metric for EIGRP updates received or sent ?<br />I think I had read the same thing about decreasing the hop count of RIP updates using offset-list but didn&#39;t find how to do it, and I am not sure you would want to do something like that. Would that not be a recipe for routing loops ?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Mat",

      "html": "Although the offset-list CLI help claims you can increase or decrease RIP hop count (even if you use it in EIGRP ;) ), you cannot enter negative offset. You can only increase hop count (with RIP) or delay (with EIGRP).<br />And, as you\u2019ve said, entering negative offset would be a nice recipe for a routing loop.",
