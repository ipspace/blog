  html: I completely agree that server virtualization is changing the data center
    significantly.  One issue I&#39;ve struggled with is that virtualized hosts that
    use VMotion require larger layer 2 domains than I&#39;d prefer.<br /><br />I did
    have a bit of expansion on the VMWare trunking issue.  Even when trunking to VMWare
    servers BPDU Guard and Portfast can be deployed.  The VMWare virtual switch doesn&#39;t
    participate in the spanning tree and there is no reason to delay bringing the
    interface up for to spanning tree states to change.  This is identical behavior
    to trunking to an HP physical server running Windows.  In these cases the only
    function the trunk interface provides is VLAN tagging.

  html: I second that. <br />One important thing that needs to be mentioned over and
    over is that IMHO it is the shift of the responsibility that is the most important
    change over here. <br /><br />Now, we as &quot;pure&quot; technical personnel
    do not really care about the chain of responsibility in whole organization up
    to the CEO, however we start to care when we see that it doesn&#39;t work, simply
    because nobody from the management point of view is aware of this shift.<br /><br
    />One example in the traditional &quot;Vertical Tower Model&quot; of management
    structure employed in almost every big organizations -  servers belong to &quot;Server
    Management Tower&quot; and network to &quot;Network Management Tower&quot; and
    in no way they manage devices for each other, or have a common budget.<br /><br
    />F.e. the usual issues:<br />What happens if the VMswitch failes? <br />Who troubleshoots?
    <br />Who opens troubleshooting tickets to VMswitch provider? <br />Whose problem
    is it, really?<br />Who &quot;owns&quot; the VMswitch?<br /><br />If you answer
    all the questions above and create procedures around it, you will find out that
    you have changed the way your IT organization works so much, that you should go
    and rearrange the whole mgmt structure in a more horizontal way....
