  html: You can control routing and you can&#39;t control bridging. <br />what is
    the criteria to choose bridging path ? only source mac address.Whole bridging
    process looks like rpf check.

  html: Couple of additional points:<br /><br />- Interface cost<br /><br />- Zero-configuration
    vs. almost universally required some sort of manual-ish configuration (at least
    for IP)<br /><br />But, stepping back a bit, I am confused - why is there a comparison
    of routing with bridging? Why not just use whatever is more optimal in a particular
    circumstance? Surely there are some cases where bridging works better (or is the
    only option), some others where there is a choice and yet others where routing
    is the only option?<br /><br />This discussion really reminds me the eternal argument
    about &quot;which is better - IP VPN or VPLS?&quot;. The answer, in my opinion,
    is &quot;use that which makes sense in the particular circumstances&quot;.<br
    /><br />Than again, I may be missing something here.

  html: Excellent work, Ivan! I think a lot of people might underestimate how difficult
    it can be to compile such a list of contrasts that we rarely ponder in our day-to-day
    work.

  html: You forgot troubleshooting and operations. It&#39;s very, very, very difficult
    to troubleshoot a broken L2 network due to the inherent stateless nature of its
    forwarding. <br /><br />So when it breaks, you don&#39;t have good tools to fix
    it.

  html: The point is that bridging is never optimal. It only looks that way.

  html: etherealmind beat me to the punch. The operational advantages of well-designed
    L3 networks can&#39;t be overlooked. L2 networks typically extend fault domains
    to the point that outages are very painful and widespread.<br /><br />Nice article,
    Ivan.

  html: '&gt; bridging is never optimal<br /><br />Yes, not &quot;by itself&quot;
    (untill TRILL comes, anyway). It can be designed to be fairly optimal by using
    hierarchical topology, multiple MST regions and bridge priorities. Agreed, this
    won&#39;t work in *all* circumstances, but when it does, cost savings often far
    outweigh the inconvenience.'

  html: There are many things yet to be invented in bridging without the need of routing
    protocols.<br />We think that transparent bridging can evolve in a pure bridging
    form, without hybridating with IS-IS protocols en layer two. <br />Our proposal
    for shortest path bridges without rooting is ARP-Path (aka FastPath), abstracted  in:<br
    /><br />http://adrian.idv.hk/doku.php/paper/icgara10-fastpath<br /><br />And implemented
    in (best demo award in LCN 2010):<br /><br />http://www.ieeelcn.org/prior/LCN35/lcn35demos/lcn-demo2010_ibanez.pdf<br
    /><br />The key new mechanism is locking for some time the address learning to
    the first port where the source address of a broadcast packet is received, discarding
    all other frames.<br />The other one is to use this mechanism with  standard ARP
    Requests and Replys to find and learn the shortest path  between two hosts when
    needed.

  html: This is additional and recent info for those interested in bridging without
    routing.<br />ARP-Path sets up low latency unicast path and multicast trees with
    the same simple mechanism. Being the paths set up when needed based on the fastest
    to reach destination, it then performs automatic load distribution among redundant
    paths. <br />This is a link to a presentation recently uploaded to IEEE 802.1
    (references at the end contain links to papers):<br />http://www.ieee802.org/1/files/public/docs2011/fyi-ibanez-arp-path-0111-v03.pdf
