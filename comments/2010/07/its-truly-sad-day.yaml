  html: 'It seems that there a lot of L2 routing protocol standards coming soon that
    do essentially the same thing: Routing Ethernet using modified IS-IS. It will
    be interesting to see how they play out.'

  html: I know it&#39;s still just bridging but since they are using IS-IS and able
    to do some things normally done at Layer 3 (no blocked ports, ECMP, SPF) it kind
    of makes sense (if you&#39;re in marketing ;) ) to call it routing at Layer 2.
