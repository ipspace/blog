  html: Dang, remember the times when reliable multicast was invented for that same
    purpose :)

  html: It would be awesome if we would see that Multicast would be used more when
    sharing large amounts of data across many computers. I don&#39;t know all the
    ins and outs of Multicast, but I see trouble with acknowledgments and resending
    of lost data.. :(

  html: You see, that&#39;s the difference between an academic solution and real-life
    engineering  :-P<br /><br />If you want to deploy reliable multicast, you have
    to deploy multicast in your network (assuming your 1000 servers are not bridged
    together), find a software package that actually supports reliable multicast and
    then troubleshoot the whole thing until you find out all the bugs and omissions.
    Of course there could be a huge hidden community of reliable multicast users that
    I&#39;m totally unaware of (I already got burnt on server-to-server FTP transfers
    and Tcl+IOS skills, so I should have learnt to shut up ... but I haven&#39;t ...
    yet).<br /><br />On the other hand, you can take software stress-tested by millions
    of users, tweak it a bit and have it up and running in a few days. Not to mention
    this solution is way more scalable and resilient than reliable multicast could
    ever be ... but, yes, it uses more bandwidth ... which might not be relevant if
    you&#39;re distributing 100MB package over 10Gb links  8-)

  html: Well the whole idea of reliable multicast was relying on NAKs (negative ACKs)
    as opposed to positive ACKs - this reduces the upstream feedback flow - and implementing
    intermediate buffering - this improves local stream recovery. The design was therefore
    relatively scalable, but never reached widespread adoption, though there is (limited)
    support in Cisco IOS.

  html: See this is why we&#39;re screwed with Internet ;) They always throw in bandwidth
    on any problem and then go on a coffee break saying how much progress we have
    made! <br /><br />I damn the Moore law every day, it just spoils people ;)

  html: I never knew https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5740 such thing existed already.
    Another day, another thing learned :-)

  html: On the subject of multicast software deployment, I thought you might find
    this interesting; we use it to deploy disk images to our Windows XPE-based point
    of sale devices. <br /><br />http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/papers/frisbee-usenix03/
