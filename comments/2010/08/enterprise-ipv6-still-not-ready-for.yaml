  html: 2001:420::/32 addresses have been hitting our v6-enabled web sites lately,
    so it looks like *someone* at Cisco is using IPv6.

  html: Sure. Nobody is saying Cisco (as a company) has any problems with IPv6. Their
    routers, switches and firewalls work as expected and I would expect no less from
    their (usually great) IT organization ... unfortunately some business units were
    asleep at the wheel.

  html: I&#39;m -7 so it isn&#39;t only the company that is myopic. ;-)<br />It is
    difficult I think to get the timing right and you could equally argue that it
    is the fault of the network operators not putting their money where their mouth
    is.<br />That be as it may, I think everyone in the network industry and I certainly
    know that we in cisco are taking the transition to IPv6 seriously and doing our
    absolute best to close any feature or platform gaps there are.

  html: 'First of all, I&#39;m honored that you&#39;ve stopped by my blog!<br /><br
    />I 90% agree with you - Cisco (the routing &amp; switching company) did a lot
    to push &amp; promote IPv6 and support its early adopters and I know all you&#39;ve
    been a market leader in this space for years (if not for decade or longer).<br
    /><br />Unfortunately, recent additions to Cisco (the corporatopolis), primarily
    in the Enterprise space, don&#39;t seem to share your enthusiasm and commitment.
    This causes significant problems to those people that also want to do their absolute
    best and provide IPv6 content. <br /><br />The worst offender (from this perspective)
    is ACE load balancer, but I&#39;m also wondering how an enterprise is supposed
    to protect itself against web/HTTP-over-IPv6 attacks considering that Ironport
    still does not support IPv6. By not deploying IPv6?<br /><br />As for the SP space:
    yet again, I absolutely agree with you.'

  html: I have been trying to get a simple questions answered that is very apropos
    for this topic with Cisco gear &#39;supporting&#39; IPv6:<br /><br />When can
    I see OSPFv3 authentication in SXI (6500) and SG (4948E/4900M) family?<br /><br
    />How can Cisco claim production IPv6 code since 2001 when I cannot even authentication
    my routing sessions?

  html: Yeah, most enterprise engineers are very fluent in IS-IS and migrating to
    another L3 protocol AND another routing protocol at the same time makes perfect
    sense  :-P
