      "html": "I would alter your first conclusion slightly:<br /><br />Non IOS-XR intermediate routers passed the unknown transitive attribute unaltered (as per the RFC) and didn&#39;t cause any problems for their peers.<br /><br />I think this, coupled with your fourth conclusion are the most likely explanation for the limited impact.<br /><br />I am not sure I agree with enabling the dropping of unknown transitive attributes. The default handling of unknown transitive attributes is the reason that BGP has been able to operate on the same major version number for 15 years and without this behaviour there is no way that 4 byte ASNs could have been deployed so quickly.  Memory consumption due to RIB growth is much more worrying to me than growth due to large path attributes.<br /><br />The ability to inject prefixes with large attributes attached in order to cause memory consumption is an interesting idea, but as a vector it seems to have limited value.  It is something that would appear to the script kiddie end of the market, who generally don&#39;t have access to unfiltered BGP sessions.  The real bad guys are much more interested in attacks such as injecting bogus prefixes in order to hijack traffic or cause a DoS which they can monetise.  The sorts of random effects seen on Friday are unlikely to appeal here.<br /><br />In my mind the real crime in BGP development is the amount of time it is taking to get a working implementation of S-BGP / SO-BGP.  Lack of basic route update security is a far greater risk to operations than optional transitive attributes...",
