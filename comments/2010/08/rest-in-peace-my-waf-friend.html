            <div class="comment-content">Ironport Web Security boxes aren&#39;t reverse proxies, which is what Cisco ACE family of products are. They protect your internal users from threats on the Internet, but do not perform content verification, SSL offload or  load balancing for the server farm in your DMZ.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />maybe Cisco realized there is not a market for these kind of appliances or was ran over by somebody else.<br /><br />Personally I believe that Cisco realized (finally) that this is not a segment they should play on,  as all web hosting designs are governed on L7 by the application folks, which usually get to choose stuff protecting their apps on their own. What I noticed they usually do is choose software based server protective mechanism, as a apache/php mod for example. <br />As the application guys speak totally different language and the world of Cisco is unknown to them, they never choose anything from Cisco, hence Cisco has no stakes in it.<br /><br />Also, to express my opinion, the network engineers do not rush into suggesting anything else, as putting L7 devices managed by network guys infront of public facing servers is a bad idea due to the &quot;it&#39;s not our fault&quot; tendency. <br />To further illustrate the concept, and to be very strict about it, putting WAN accelators in is similar in a way that you find ourself working on obscure &quot;it&#39;s the WAN Accelator fault&quot; issues 8 hours a week.<br /><br />All in all, what is your view on the older NANOG discussion http://markmail.org/thread/fvordsbnuc74fuu2</div>

            <div class="comment-content">This is walking away from their Security Products and showing how little Cisco thinks of Security. <br /><br />If cisco isn&#39;t going to deliver a full spectrum of security products, are they are viable partner ? <br /><br />Of course, if they had a camera or did videoconferencing, they wouldn&#39;t have been killed.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">This is the second product line in as many months that they&#39;re walking away from -- both are security products.  They&#39;ve made it clear that they have no interest in the SIM/SEIM market, so they&#39;ve effectively given up on CS-MARS.  They don&#39;t even recommend it any more.<br /><br />Is Cisco going to move to just offering a cursory line of security products now?  Stuff they can just bundle with other product sales when a customer wants the get it from one vendor?  I don&#39;t see them killing off the ASA or IPS, but those products aren&#39;t really leaders anymore.<br /><br />In fact, what in their security products line IS worth a crap any more?</div>
