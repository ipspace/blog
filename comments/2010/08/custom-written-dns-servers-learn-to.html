            <div class="comment-content">This recently happened to me as well, because the name server thought he was authoritative for the entire internet. Its one of those configuration mistakes that only show up if you have CNAMEs pointing to other zones not hosted on the same name server.<br />And to make it more annoying to troubleshoot, some DNS servers like BIND can still resolve the records while others such as the one included in windows returns NXDOMAIN.<br /><br />How does this happen? In my case the DNS server was PowerDNS with a mysql backend. Someone or some poorly written script, entered a blank line in the database, which caused PowerDNS to behave like this.</div>
