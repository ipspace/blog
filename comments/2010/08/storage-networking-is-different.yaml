  html: You also need to consider what happens when a peak race condition occurs.
    For example, a burst of backup traffic combined with a virus scan at the same
    time that critical service runs can cause major networking problems where queues
    can be overrun, switch fabrics overloaded, and more. <br /><br />Classic FC copes
    by using an XON/XOFF method combined with over specification of the network, while
    IP queueing and buffering handles iSCSI/NFS methods. Two methods to solve the
    same problem.
