            <p class="comment-content">You also need to consider what happens when a peak race condition occurs. For example, a burst of backup traffic combined with a virus scan at the same time that critical service runs can cause major networking problems where queues can be overrun, switch fabrics overloaded, and more. <br /><br />Classic FC copes by using an XON/XOFF method combined with over specification of the network, while IP queueing and buffering handles iSCSI/NFS methods. Two methods to solve the same problem.</p>
