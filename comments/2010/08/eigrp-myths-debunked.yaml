  html: Very interesting, I&#39;ve been trying to tell people about EIGRP not being
    &quot;hybrid&quot; for a long time, but only had a couple of reasons under my
    belt to say. I shall be referring back to this one a lot!

  html: I agree with you Ivan,  <br /> <br />EIGRP it&#39;s not a Link State, let
    me add that it relies on split horizon, that&#39;s unnecessary on links state
    protocols... <br /> <br />thanks as usual for the interesting arguments <br />

  html: Correct me if I m wrong but like a LS routing protocol, EIGRP forms adjacencies
    with his neighbors and some parameters in the hello have to match.<br /><br />For
    me this is why ppl say that EIGRP has some LS routing protocol feature.<br /><br
    />What do you think ?<br /><br />twitter.com/mcl_nicolas

  html: When I say some parameters must match I would correct myself and say that
    only the K values must match :))

  html: Like Ivan states in the last point, dynamic adjacency formation, while nice,
    isn&#39;t related to maintaining a link state database.

  html: or in other words - it is possible to design a LS protocol without having
    dynamic adjacency formation

  html: 'Just to put our debate into a historical perspective: dynamic neighbor discovery,
    adjacency formation and fast neighbor loss discovery are considered common sense
    today.<br /><br />These mechanisms were not part of any of the early DV routing
    protocols, including RIP, IPX RIP, AppleTalk, DECnet, XNS ... so having that functionality
    in EIGRP was something quite novel (as was the idea of having the same routing
    protocol for three address families).<br /><br />However, that has been 15 years
    ago and it&#39;s irresponsible to cut-and-paste from the ancient lore and resell
    those fragments as absolute truth.'

    dynamic neighbor discovery.'

  html: Hi! I have a question.<br />First. Routers configured with eigrp with same
    parameters. Then they form the neighbor table.<br />Second, they send updates.
    What are these updates? Where do they come from? From topology table or the routing
    table?

  html: I think at a more basic &quot;ccna guy on the street&quot; level (that would
    be me), the issue of whether eigrp can be thought of as either LS or DV revolves
    around what aspect of those two types you are specifically talking about.  If
    you stand up and scream &quot;distance vector protocol&quot;, most ccna level
    guys will immediately think &quot;hop count for metric&quot;.  The first thing
    you ever learned about DV. If i then say &quot;eigrp is a distance vector protocol&quot;,
    again, I think, most ccna level guys will immediately think hop count - in other
    words they are thinking about the metric aspect of eigrp simply because you said
    &quot;distance vector&quot;.  But eigrp does not use hop count to make its path
    selection, rather bandwidth and delay.  So for me, I always felt it strange to
    hear eigrp described as DV (still do), when the most prominant feature, metric,
    is not hop count, hence, not (from my perspective) what most people think of FIRST
    when they they think of DV.  Does any of that sound coherent?

  html: You sound perfectly coherent ... and obviously we&#39;re doing a very bad
    job explaining the fundamentals of the routing protocols @ CCNA level. As you
    know, hop count is just one possible metric.
