            <div class="comment-content">Dear Your Name Here!<br /><br />I&#39;m all for communities and sharing ... but this activity usually works best when it&#39;s reciprocal. So, shall we start with our names?<br /><br />Next, I&#39;ve shared an awful lot of my knowledge with you in the last few years in this blog, our wiki and my articles. I&#39;d love to know what you&#39;ve shared with us in the meantime. It could be you&#39;re one of my fellow bloggers in disguise or one of the many people who helped me make my blog better, in which case I would be delighted to buy you a beer or two.<br /><br />I understand that you believe in true sharing and don&#39;t want to attend money making events, so you could step forward, say &quot;hey, Ivan, some of us would just like to have a chat, can we sit down somewhere in the evening and enjoy ourselves&quot;, and organize the event. If you decide to do so, I would be glad to attend. In the meantime, please excuse me if I&#39;m trying to find interesting ways to pay my bills.<br /><br />Ivan</div>
