      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />A thought provoking post :)<br /><br />Server hardening may be &quot;mission impossible&quot; but it is still essential.  Very rarely is every server provisioned in a separate broadcast domain, if you rely on a big-iron firewall for your security you are going to be left at risk from the zero-day that hits the machine next to you.  Or even from the compromised administrator&#39;s laptop that connects without going through the firewall.<br /><br />I think there is an argument for defence in depth, putting a dedicated resource between you and your greatest attack vector to reduce your load is always going to be a good idea.  If your risk is great it may even be worth adding an additional firewall level from a second vendor in series.  If a stateless firewall can capture the largest threats without blocking valid content then it may be the right choice, either on its own, or in addition to the stateful firewall.  <br /><br />Of course managing layered firewalls like this comes with its own configuration management issues that could put you at more risk of outage than running without the firewalls..<br /><br />Sure some apps are hard to put behind static ACLs, but equally there are plenty of examples of where stateful firewalls get their application code wrong and can break networks just as badly as a badly written ACL (an example that immediately springs to mind is the SMTP code in early PIXes.  For years the first command I would enter in a default PIX config was &quot;no fixup smtp&quot;.  Memory leaks in SIP ALGs is a more contemporary and widespread issue.)<br /><br />Discounting endpoint security as &quot;mission impossible&quot; says to me that we need to find a new way to handle it because we sure as hell can&#39;t give up on it.  Of course I don&#39;t have an answer for *how* we deal with it or I would be running away to the patent office right now ;)",

      "html": "Stateful inspection makes zero sense when every incoming connection is unsolicited - as is the case with Web servers, DNS servers, et. al.<br /><br />Furthermore, even the largest firewalls available have state-tables which are easily exhausted either by legitimate flash crowds or by layer-7 attack traffic crafted in such a way as to appear perfectly legitimate, passing all firewall rules and &#39;inspectors&#39;.  Stateful firewalls are DDoS chokepoints, they can withstand far fewer sessions than the hosts behind them, and they always fall over during DDoS attacks.<br /><br />And of course, the firewalls themselves are merely special-purpose computers running code - and there are bugs in that code, as the list of security flaws and patches for every commercial firewall vendor demonstrates.  Add this to the fact that the code written for these devices receives much less scrutiny than OS/application/service code, and one can see that in addition to the availability threat they pose, firewalls also greatly broaden the attack surface and potentially provide obscure vectors for attackers to compromise these blackbox devices.<br /><br />None of the large-scale Internet properties with which readers are familiar put stateful firewalls (or so-called &#39;IPS&#39;) in front of their servers - at least, the ones which stay up and running.  <br /><br />Stateful firewalls have no place whatsoever in front of servers, period.  There&#39;s no state to inspect, and they greatly reduce the security posture of organizations which make the mistake of placing them in front of servers.<br /><br />Stateless ACLs in hardware-based routing/switching platforms which can handle millions of packets-per-second in hardware are the BCP for enforcing communications policy for servers. <br /><br />This NANOG presentation succinctly demolishes the myth that firewalls (and other stateful inspection devices) should be placed inline in front of servers:<br /><br />http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog48/presentations/Monday/Kaeo_FilterTrend_ISPSec_N48.pdf",

However, you&#39;re focusing at a particularly exposed and demanding market segment: large content providers. As I wrote in the post, they are one extreme of the whole spectrum, the other one being a mid-sized enterprise (don&#39;t want to go down to SMB) with very mixed server environment and application requiring dynamic ports.<br /><br />While the lessons learned in high-volume environment are definitely worth considering (and as I wrote, they are best served by router-based ACLs), not everyone has the same amount of knowledge, the team size that these content providers enjoy, the same requirements or the same exposure. These lessons are thus not directly applicable to other environments, as they can sometimes do more harm than good (see the other end of the spectrum).<br /><br />What you&#39;re talking about are F1 racing cars of the content business. That&#39;s where the technology is stressed, where we learn how to improve it and how to design it better (one can only hope the same knowledge transfer would work in the IT industry); but the methodologies used there cannot be applied directly to a commodity car (which will also not be exposed to most of the stresses an F1 racing car is).",

      "html": "Ivan,<br /><br />You mentioned TCP SYN cookie support in stateful firewalls.  Frankly, I think this is an awful feature.  It requires the firewall to intercept/terminate the TCP session, and can lead to lots of crazy failure scenarios.  Imagine, for example, if the server (or an intermediate router) doesn&#39;t know the path back to the client.  TCP 3 way handshake appears to succeed, but then the application never responds.  What has really happened is that the client has never established 2-way communication with the server.  ...and for what benefit?  TCP SYN cookie support is easy to implement.  A server that doesn&#39;t have it probably shouldn&#39;t be facing the wrath of the Internet.<br /><br />Also, about TCP fingerprinting...  You said that a stateful firewall *can* prevent fingerprinting.  I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s true -- you&#39;d need much more than just state awareness to prevent fingerprinting.  You&#39;d need to strip funny TCP options, rewrite sequence numbers...  You&#39;re getting much closer to a full-blown TCP proxy than you are a stateful firewall.  Not that it&#39;s a big deal (netcat can do it), it&#39;s just not something that I think of as a firewall function.  Do firewall vendors market this as a feature?",

This is a tacit admission that stateful inspection has no role in front of servers, as there&#39;s no state to inspect.<br /><br />The DDoS vector and increase in the overall compromise attack surface these devices bring with them are very real threats, and are additional reasons for not deploying firewalls in front of servers; but even if these weren&#39;t concerns (and they&#39;re HUGE concerns), the fundamental illogicality of inserting a stateful inspection device in the topology where there is in fact no state to inspect is the larger point.",

These machines, hence, could not be trusted to manage their own connections properly, and so a separate purpose-built appliance was needed.<br /><br />It really comes down to economics.  The marketplace (or the bazaar) has largely proven that we are unwilling to spend more time &amp; money on software to ensure it is well-audited, free of security holes.  We collectively prefer new features in our software.<br /><br />Anyway, the stateful firewalls that I prefer give me everything I need: centralized management of a well-organized security policy.  (Not to mention fulfillment of the auditors&#39; requirement that we have such a firewall in place.)<br /><br />Moreover, I&#39;m not convinced that the app &amp; OS authors have gotten any better at writing their networking code, code that is perhaps not shielded by a stateless ACL.<br /><br />DDOS is also less of a concern for me.
