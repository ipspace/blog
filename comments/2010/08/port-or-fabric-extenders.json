      "html": "one of beautiful limitations currently on the Nexus 2k or 5k is the inability to configure SPAN session that has source and destination on the same 5k FEX interface. <br /><br />So say you want to span the traffic between one server in the rack, into another server in the same rack - bad luck with your &quot;top of the rack&quot; design, you need to pull another cable from N5k directly into the server.<br /><br />Also, as a rant,  the older generation of N2k had 1000Mbps port only, so connecting servers with iLO/remote management card that is only capable of 100Mbps was not possible, you had had to pull YET ANOTHER cable from N5k....",
