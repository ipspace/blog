  html: Free devices are unsustainable without contracts (ie. prepaid) in a world
    where provider locks can be defeated for $2-20 USD. Every one they sell is likely
    to be a loss leader and may not even end up generating revenue for them if it
    is unlocked and used on another carrier.<br /><br />On the one hand, I like the
    idea of no handset subsidies because it reduces the need for contracts and gives
    lower prices because the carrier isn&#39;t put a financing charge into the monthly
    plan. On the other hand, loyalty is important to running a good carrier and customers
    are now addicted to heavily subsidized devices, so they will not go away. In fact,
    for most carriers, there is no incentive to bring your own device; they don&#39;t
    offer you a price break and in fact you may pay more for certain rate plans.
