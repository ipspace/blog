This causes significant problems to those people that also want to do their absolute best and provide IPv6 content. <br /><br />The worst offender (from this perspective) is ACE load balancer, but I&#39;m also wondering how an enterprise is supposed to protect itself against web/HTTP-over-IPv6 attacks considering that Ironport still does not support IPv6. By not deploying IPv6?<br /><br />As for the SP space: yet again, I absolutely agree with you.",
