      "html": "Free devices are unsustainable without contracts (ie. prepaid) in a world where provider locks can be defeated for $2-20 USD. Every one they sell is likely to be a loss leader and may not even end up generating revenue for them if it is unlocked and used on another carrier.<br /><br />On the one hand, I like the idea of no handset subsidies because it reduces the need for contracts and gives lower prices because the carrier isn&#39;t put a financing charge into the monthly plan. On the other hand, loyalty is important to running a good carrier and customers are now addicted to heavily subsidized devices, so they will not go away. In fact, for most carriers, there is no incentive to bring your own device; they don&#39;t offer you a price break and in fact you may pay more for certain rate plans.",
