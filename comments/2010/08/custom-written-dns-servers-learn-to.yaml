  html: This recently happened to me as well, because the name server thought he was
    authoritative for the entire internet. Its one of those configuration mistakes
    that only show up if you have CNAMEs pointing to other zones not hosted on the
    same name server.<br />And to make it more annoying to troubleshoot, some DNS
    servers like BIND can still resolve the records while others such as the one included
    in windows returns NXDOMAIN.<br /><br />How does this happen? In my case the DNS
    server was PowerDNS with a mysql backend. Someone or some poorly written script,
    entered a blank line in the database, which caused PowerDNS to behave like this.
