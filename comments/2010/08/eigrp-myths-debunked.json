      "html": "I think at a more basic &quot;ccna guy on the street&quot; level (that would be me), the issue of whether eigrp can be thought of as either LS or DV revolves around what aspect of those two types you are specifically talking about.  If you stand up and scream &quot;distance vector protocol&quot;, most ccna level guys will immediately think &quot;hop count for metric&quot;.  The first thing you ever learned about DV. If i then say &quot;eigrp is a distance vector protocol&quot;, again, I think, most ccna level guys will immediately think hop count - in other words they are thinking about the metric aspect of eigrp simply because you said &quot;distance vector&quot;.  But eigrp does not use hop count to make its path selection, rather bandwidth and delay.  So for me, I always felt it strange to hear eigrp described as DV (still do), when the most prominant feature, metric, is not hop count, hence, not (from my perspective) what most people think of FIRST when they they think of DV.  Does any of that sound coherent?",
