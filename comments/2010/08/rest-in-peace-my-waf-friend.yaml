  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Maybe Cisco wants us to migrate to the IronPort Web Security
    Appliances. They do http(s)/ftp/layer-4 inspections, ... aparently.<br /><br />Regards,<br

  html: Ironport Web Security boxes aren&#39;t reverse proxies, which is what Cisco
    ACE family of products are. They protect your internal users from threats on the
    Internet, but do not perform content verification, SSL offload or  load balancing
    for the server farm in your DMZ.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />maybe Cisco realized there is not a market for these kind
    of appliances or was ran over by somebody else.<br /><br />Personally I believe
    that Cisco realized (finally) that this is not a segment they should play on,  as
    all web hosting designs are governed on L7 by the application folks, which usually
    get to choose stuff protecting their apps on their own. What I noticed they usually
    do is choose software based server protective mechanism, as a apache/php mod for
    example. <br />As the application guys speak totally different language and the
    world of Cisco is unknown to them, they never choose anything from Cisco, hence
    Cisco has no stakes in it.<br /><br />Also, to express my opinion, the network
    engineers do not rush into suggesting anything else, as putting L7 devices managed
    by network guys infront of public facing servers is a bad idea due to the &quot;it&#39;s
    not our fault&quot; tendency. <br />To further illustrate the concept, and to
    be very strict about it, putting WAN accelators in is similar in a way that you
    find ourself working on obscure &quot;it&#39;s the WAN Accelator fault&quot; issues
    8 hours a week.<br /><br />All in all, what is your view on the older NANOG discussion

  html: This is walking away from their Security Products and showing how little Cisco
    thinks of Security. <br /><br />If cisco isn&#39;t going to deliver a full spectrum
    of security products, are they are viable partner ? <br /><br />Of course, if
    they had a camera or did videoconferencing, they wouldn&#39;t have been killed.

  html: This is the second product line in as many months that they&#39;re walking
    away from -- both are security products.  They&#39;ve made it clear that they
    have no interest in the SIM/SEIM market, so they&#39;ve effectively given up on
    CS-MARS.  They don&#39;t even recommend it any more.<br /><br />Is Cisco going
    to move to just offering a cursory line of security products now?  Stuff they
    can just bundle with other product sales when a customer wants the get it from
    one vendor?  I don&#39;t see them killing off the ASA or IPS, but those products
    aren&#39;t really leaders anymore.<br /><br />In fact, what in their security
    products line IS worth a crap any more?

  html: Give Barrier1 a try. Barrier1 uses WAF and other components as sensors thus
    inspecting ALL 7 OSI layers in near real time. Along with that Barrier1 Adv. Reporting
    and it&#39;s 736 different log formats becomes a SIEM, Log Analysis, and DLP as
    well. With the speed 1 device can and has been inspecting data, VOIP, and IP/TV
    for over 4 years.
