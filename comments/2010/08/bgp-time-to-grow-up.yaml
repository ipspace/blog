  html: Don&#39;t forget that IOS XR can also run on Cisco 12k with PRP supervisors.
    I guess this platform is much more widespread, but it would mean that a lot of
    people still use legacy IOS on it.

  html: I would totaly agree with you. <br />Finding ways to protect those transitive
    attributes is just like a FW with a &quot;permit any&quot; entry at the end, with
    the explicit deny entries before it - that&#39;s just wrong.

  html: I would alter your first conclusion slightly:<br /><br />Non IOS-XR intermediate
    routers passed the unknown transitive attribute unaltered (as per the RFC) and
    didn&#39;t cause any problems for their peers.<br /><br />I think this, coupled
    with your fourth conclusion are the most likely explanation for the limited impact.<br
    /><br />I am not sure I agree with enabling the dropping of unknown transitive
    attributes. The default handling of unknown transitive attributes is the reason
    that BGP has been able to operate on the same major version number for 15 years
    and without this behaviour there is no way that 4 byte ASNs could have been deployed
    so quickly.  Memory consumption due to RIB growth is much more worrying to me
    than growth due to large path attributes.<br /><br />The ability to inject prefixes
    with large attributes attached in order to cause memory consumption is an interesting
    idea, but as a vector it seems to have limited value.  It is something that would
    appear to the script kiddie end of the market, who generally don&#39;t have access
    to unfiltered BGP sessions.  The real bad guys are much more interested in attacks
    such as injecting bogus prefixes in order to hijack traffic or cause a DoS which
    they can monetise.  The sorts of random effects seen on Friday are unlikely to
    appeal here.<br /><br />In my mind the real crime in BGP development is the amount
    of time it is taking to get a working implementation of S-BGP / SO-BGP.  Lack
    of basic route update security is a far greater risk to operations than optional
    transitive attributes...
