  html: 'Oh, but you missed my absolute favorite myth about IPv6. The one that says
    the Internet will collapse the day IANA runs out of unassigned /8s [AKA &quot;the
    day when we &#39;run out&#39; of IP addresses].<br /><br />Personally, I think
    the whole IPv6 business is just a complete waste of time. When s..t hits the fan,
    we&#39;ll use something more compatible with IPv4 [IPv5? - read as &quot;ip 55&quot;].
    That&#39;s just me, though.<br /><br />--<br />Marko Milivojevic - CCIE #18427<br
