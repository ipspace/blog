      "html": "You can always configure your ftp server to supply a specific range of tcp ports for the data connections eg. passive ports command in wu-ftpd ftpaccess. <br />This is also true for SIP rtp ports, and it might be safer to configure static acls than place a SIP-aware firewall which might open dynamically something you don&#39;t want.",

You could use FTPS instead of course but then none of your firewalls will be able to snoop the ports and you&#39;re back at square one.  The answer of course is just to use SSH - SCP or sFTP and all of these problems are sorted.",

After spending some time thinking about FTP, its intended usages and its design limitations, one has to conclude that they did a great engineering (and a lousy architectural) job.<br /><br />The story promoted in the TED talk could have some basis in reality, but it&#39;s mostly an oversimplified fairy tale. I was truly sad to discover that; previously I took TED talks seriously, now I watch them only for their entertainment value.",
