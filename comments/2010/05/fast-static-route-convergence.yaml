  html: Mmm. Could be a good case to use an IP SLA tracking object to automatically
    remove the static route. A simple &quot;ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 &lt;next&gt;
    track 1&quot; will do that nicely. This assume &quot;1&quot; is your ip sla tracking.&lt;/next&gt;

  html: SLA tracking will obviously work, but the idea of static routes based on dynamic
    next-hop is to simplify configuration, not to make it more complex ;)
