      "html": "Hello Ivan, Digital books are ok, but they cannot be highlighted and annotated in the same easy way as a paper book, this is something that the iPad and it&#39;s competitors need to provide otherwise they will be no good for learning materials and study material.  I continually annotate my books and highlight them.  I also add little drawings and notes in all directions, arrows etc.  I have not seen a digital system provide such features using a completely natural interface like a pen.  (Apple should do something finger based, but at present I doubt it).",

      "html": "I don&#39;t like writing in books anyway, as if and when I use them for reference at a later date, all the notes and highlighting will get in the way of what I&#39;m trying to learn. Plus, I don&#39;t find this a good way of interpreting information to yourself, like making your own separate notes would.<br /><br />Therefore to me digital books are just as good as physical (analogue? :P) books",

      "html": "Ivan, printed books are inferior in every possible aspect. As soon as there are reasonable reading devices for tech publication on the market (it seems they are close) all printed materials should go away.So why anyone whould cling on them? The only reason I can imagine is that it is easy to charge for them. But actually it is the same story as the teachers talking about inattentive students, most of the time the problem is thier own incompetence as a teacher. Also please note that the current system with printed books implies that the reader is charged before it is aware of the quality of the contents, which is a little bit unfair, not to say more.",
