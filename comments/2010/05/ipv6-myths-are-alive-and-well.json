The one that says the Internet will collapse the day IANA runs out of unassigned /8s [AKA &quot;the day when we &#39;run out&#39; of IP addresses].<br /><br />Personally, I think the whole IPv6 business is just a complete waste of time. When s..t hits the fan, we&#39;ll use something more compatible with IPv4 [IPv5? - read as &quot;ip 55&quot;]. That&#39;s just me, though.<br /><br />--<br />Marko Milivojevic - CCIE #18427<br />Senior Technical Instructor - IPexpert",
