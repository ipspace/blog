  html: Hello Ivan, Digital books are ok, but they cannot be highlighted and annotated
    in the same easy way as a paper book, this is something that the iPad and it&#39;s
    competitors need to provide otherwise they will be no good for learning materials
    and study material.  I continually annotate my books and highlight them.  I also
    add little drawings and notes in all directions, arrows etc.  I have not seen
    a digital system provide such features using a completely natural interface like
    a pen.  (Apple should do something finger based, but at present I doubt it).

  html: I don&#39;t like writing in books anyway, as if and when I use them for reference
    at a later date, all the notes and highlighting will get in the way of what I&#39;m
    trying to learn. Plus, I don&#39;t find this a good way of interpreting information
    to yourself, like making your own separate notes would.<br /><br />Therefore to
    me digital books are just as good as physical (analogue? :P) books

  html: Ivan, printed books are inferior in every possible aspect. As soon as there
    are reasonable reading devices for tech publication on the market (it seems they
    are close) all printed materials should go away.So why anyone whould cling on
    them? The only reason I can imagine is that it is easy to charge for them. But
    actually it is the same story as the teachers talking about inattentive students,
    most of the time the problem is thier own incompetence as a teacher. Also please
    note that the current system with printed books implies that the reader is charged
    before it is aware of the quality of the contents, which is a little bit unfair,
    not to say more.

  html: Publishing in a pdf format and then locking it down with the FileOpen plugin
    is pretty formidable. Give it an eval.

  html: I&#39;ve grown to love e-books (purchased legitimately) - Being able to quickly
    search by keywords, scroll, highlight, print off specific pages.  To each their
    own though.<br /><br />That being said, when dad (I) get home at the end of the
    day, eBooks just aren&#39;t the same reading to my kids cuddling around me.

  html: If you ahve ever tried to read an O&#39;reilly book or other PDF on an e-reader
    (other than the iPad) it sucks. e-readers are still only good for text, not diagrams
    and tables.
