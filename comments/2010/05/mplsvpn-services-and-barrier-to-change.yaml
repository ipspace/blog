  html: Ivan,<br /><br />I want to address your point on routing changes requiring
    PE config modification. I helped design and operate a Tier I ISP&#39;s initial
    MPLS/VPN service in the early 2000s. You&#39;re right on that routing changes
    on the PE will be needed under certain VPN designs.<br /><br />Here is how I see
    SPs being able to minimize changes.<br /><br />1) Define your MPLS/VPN service
    that your Ops organization can support. For instance, you can only offer static
    (x prefixes or fewer), BGP, and vanilla OSPF PE-CE routing protocols.<br /><br
    />2) Involve tech savvy SEs in the customer VPN design. They know that BGP is
    natural fit for MPLS/VPN and other ways to create a supportable VPN.<br /><br
    />3) Don&#39;t try to be everything for everybody. Standardize your MPLS/VPN service
    and don&#39;t allow one-offs. If you attempt to support every PE-CE protocol and
    lots of tweaks, you will likely face challenges as the number of VPN customers
    grow.<br /><br />Jeff Loughridge

  html: Thank you for the comment. I absolutely agree with everything you wrote.<br
    /><br />Unfortunately, not all SPs or their large customers are willing to follow
    these recommendations ... and the vendors are required to implement more and more
    knobs and tricks to cater to their needs.

  html: 'The current SP environment I work in (although I&#39;m an optical guy) follows
    Jeff&#39;s suggestions 1 &amp; 3: standard offerings flexible enough to accomodate
    nearly every client while keeping ops and maintenance simple. Anyways, most issues
    aren&#39;t logical config troubles, but failures in the CE, access and transport
    network (90% of troubles), with occasional bugs in the router OS or mismatches
    in implementation.<br /><br />If you can make a solution that is simple and works
    for hundreds of clients, you can make sales and support much simpler. The few
    customers that really need something very specific will pay a premium price for
    it and have a dedicated helpdesk, so the complexity of their custom solution doesn&#39;t
    impact overalls ops and create burdens that extend beyond the lifetime of the
    contract. And a team of competent engineers that design the generic product template
    should be able to design and maintain the custom solution. Fortune 500 companies
    have the extra cash to burn if they insist on specific implementations.'
