            <div class="comment-content">Nice presentation, I made one about NAT64 at PLNOG conference in March in Poland. But why you haven&#39;t mentioned anything about performance of NAT64 and readiness of Cisco devices to handle NAT64? IMO it&#39;s good that we have an option of IPv6-to-IPv4 translations but performance of this solution is really poor, or at least not acceptable for SP and Enterprise customers.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">There is no NAT64 in Cisco IOS (yet). What we have is NAT-PT and its performance stinks because it has to be process-switched at the moment (and because it tries to solve too many problems).<br /><br />But still, a dedicated 2800-XM is able to push 8 Mbps through NAT-PT. Not bad, considering the amount of IPv6 traffic we see on the Internet.<br /><br />Pure NAT64 is coming to IOS XR and IOS XE within the CGv6 framework ... supposedly in CY 2010.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Good presentation but as you are aware since IPv6 roots were almost in the ISO&#39;s realm and almost casted as decnet v5 one thing to keep in mind.<br /><br />IP was around in 1980 and we didn&#39;t really touch it until 1995 on a significant level. So did we blow 15 years for IP? Not really different environments then but by the time 1995 rolled around IP was already &quot;old&quot; granted other protocols came along in the 90s but that is the consideration when v6 is discussed and some folks state hey its been 12 years(since 1999) and its old.. <br />Heck we almost had SIPP or TUBA. Thank god for the IETF!!!!!<br /><br />with all the ISIS TRILL Fabric type discussions about a non SPT L2 multipath environment would we have been better off if the ISO had won out and took full ownership of IPv6 and integreated into CLNS.</div>
