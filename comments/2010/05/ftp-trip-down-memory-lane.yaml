  html: You can always configure your ftp server to supply a specific range of tcp
    ports for the data connections eg. passive ports command in wu-ftpd ftpaccess.
    <br />This is also true for SIP rtp ports, and it might be safer to configure
    static acls than place a SIP-aware firewall which might open dynamically something
    you don&#39;t want.

  html: Don&#39;t forget that FTP sends username/password in the clear so is not the
    most secure of options!  You could use FTPS instead of course but then none of
    your firewalls will be able to snoop the ports and you&#39;re back at square one.  The
    answer of course is just to use SSH - SCP or sFTP and all of these problems are
    sorted.

    in the TED talk. <br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Want_of_a_Nail_(proverb))<br
    /><br />Why FTP is the way it is:) <br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o59mQhBiUo4

  html: Yes horrible SIP, that is why I am stuck configuring Acme Packet session border
    controllers (voip / sip firewall). Why the SIP people can&#39;t figure out a better
    protocol instead of recreating SS7 on IP is beyond mw

  html: Yeah, I believed that guy and wrote this post ...<br /><br />http://blog.ioshints.info/2010/03/ftp-butterfly-effect.html<br
    /><br />... only to be thoroughly (and deservedly) spanked in the comments. After
    spending some time thinking about FTP, its intended usages and its design limitations,
    one has to conclude that they did a great engineering (and a lousy architectural)
    job.<br /><br />The story promoted in the TED talk could have some basis in reality,
    but it&#39;s mostly an oversimplified fairy tale. I was truly sad to discover
    that; previously I took TED talks seriously, now I watch them only for their entertainment
    value.
