  html: I am also doing Wimax trails in India. If we talk about technology, it is
    wonderful and better than LTE and no one even knows when LTE will come in picture.
    My keen objectie is to use ASN-Gty as LNS server, so that we could server enterprise
    as well as home user.<br /><br />regards<br />Shivlu Jain<br />http://www.mplsvpn.info

  html: I&#39;ve got WIMaX as VPN GRE tunnel for a backup to my MPLS.  Unfortunately
    I can only get it at one site.  I&#39;ve tried the same thing with cell cards,
    but I don&#39;t think the providers are ready.  The tunnels never seem to hold,
    plus no provider that I can find has any clue on the business end of how to support
    this.
