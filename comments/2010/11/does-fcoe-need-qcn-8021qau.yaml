  html: Check out the pissing match at this blog post between Cisco and Brocade.  <br
    /> <br />http://www.networkcomputing.com/data-networking-management/brocade-first-to-market-with-native-end-to-end-fcoe.php  <br
    /> <br />FCoE = Buggy Whips.  <br /> <br />A technology so mindboggingly complicated
    that marketing people can argue over competing claims and all be correct.  <br
    /> <br />Customers and end users should see FCoE for what it is - a product that
    allows vendors to overcharge for a supposedly new technology while a perfect technology
    in NFS or iSCSI is available.  <br /> <br />Storage people should not be deceived
    by posturing from Brocade and Cisco and research the technology and realise that
    FCoE is dead end technology for legacy migration only.
