      "html": "Hi Ivan<br /><br />regarding the specific QoS bandwidth conditionning, newer PE platforms as the Cisco ASR9k, or Juniper MX or Alcatel SR7750 do allow the SP to do ingress traffic-shapping + queueing, so effectivelly the SP is able to apply an identical bandwidth conditionning for input and output traffic (older platforms will only allow output shapping and input policing only so the solution will require in this case a PATCH in the shape of a CE doing the traffic-shapping the SP is incapable of doing...)<br /><br />Omar Baceski",

We create multiple VRFs depending on the customer requirment, for example a data VRF and a voice Application VRF for VoIP. Not sure if this is ideal but just giving the forum some information on how at least one service provider does it.",

What are the main problems that can arise with the &quot;Access Network&quot; cloud shown in your first diagram?  Is that &quot;Access Network&quot; a shared network?  If so, who typically owns and controls the QoS policies on that network?",

More about what can happen across the whole path in:<br /><br />http://blog.ioshints.info/2010/10/qos-over-mplsvpn-networks.html<br /><br />The &quot;access network&quot; is owned and controlled by the SP, but sometimes consistent QoS/SLA is not enforced across all the elements in the path.",
