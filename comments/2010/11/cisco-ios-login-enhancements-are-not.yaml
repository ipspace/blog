  html: It&#39;s not just the lack of feature parity, there are more bugs in the IPv6
    version of management services.<br /><br />For the moment, managing your devices
    over IPv4 is more reliable.

  html: I have been managing some of my production devices recently over IPv6, including
    SNMP. Had no issues so far. Though, some needed the upgrade to the latest IOS
    to work well.<br /><br />I agree, to some extent not everything is ready yet,
    but it is still absolutely necessary to take the small steps so the issues could
    be identified early. I prefer to leave the IPv4 management as a backup solution.

  html: The relevance of using IPv6 for management should indeed be taken with more
    attention. Even when perhaps not so poular for techo guys, but from business perspective
    it could always be that business managent would like to consider handing the network
    monitoring or management to some other company, in which case not needing to deal
    with private Ip addresses and NAT is quite some advantage. In XaaS parlance, this
    would be NMaaS :-)<br />However, for this to work, not only the network elements
    must properly support IPv6 in all management protocols, but also management/monitoring
    tools and apps must also support IPv6.. Does anyone have more experiences in this
    respect?

  html: This issue is reported in the Sev4 bug :<br />CSCtb29296    ipv6 address not
    displayed properly in Login Success and Failure logs <br /><br />Seems like they
    have more severe bugs to work on :)<br /><br />Xavier

  html: As far as monitoring systems go, Zabbix has complete feature-parity; I think
    OpenNMS is actively developing their v6 features; Nagios is fairly agnostic, it&#39;s
    a per-plugin thing, and I suspect they&#39;re mostly compatible; last I checked
    (a year or so ago) Zenoss had no support and no plans.

  html: SNMP, SYSLOG via IPv6 are NOT vrf aware.<br />NTPv4 via IPv6 is not working
    with &amp; w/o vrf<br />BTW<br />ACS 5.2 has undocumented v6-capabilities per
    default!!!
