            <div class="comment-content">Check out the pissing match at this blog post between Cisco and Brocade.  <br /> <br />http://www.networkcomputing.com/data-networking-management/brocade-first-to-market-with-native-end-to-end-fcoe.php  <br /> <br />FCoE = Buggy Whips.  <br /> <br />A technology so mindboggingly complicated that marketing people can argue over competing claims and all be correct.  <br /> <br />Customers and end users should see FCoE for what it is - a product that allows vendors to overcharge for a supposedly new technology while a perfect technology in NFS or iSCSI is available.  <br /> <br />Storage people should not be deceived by posturing from Brocade and Cisco and research the technology and realise that FCoE is dead end technology for legacy migration only.</div>
