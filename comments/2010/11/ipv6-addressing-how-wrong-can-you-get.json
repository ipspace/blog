It is not a reason to implement NAT66 and certainly not a reason to deploy overloaded NAPT66 (what most people refer to as NAT in IPv4).<br /><br />More disconcerting to me is the idea that residential users should some how be treated as second-class end-sites and be given /56s or worse, /64s. There is no good reason not to give residential customers /48s like any other end site. There are MANY good reasons to give them /48s, not the least of which is to support likely innovation in the area of automatic prefix delegation and self-determining network hierarchies within the home.<br /><br />Sometimes it&#39;s not just about the number of possible end subnets. Sometimes it&#39;s about the number of bits available for topology and hierarchy.<br /><br />There are approximately 7 billion people on the planet with an average household being 3.2 people per household. As such, there is need for approximately 2 billion /48s to support every existing residence. Even if the population doubles, that&#39;s still only 4 billion households. All of that could be contained within a single /16 of IPv6 space, giving every household a /48. Really, if we can support double the current number of households with /48s using only 1/65,536 or 0.001% of the total address space, i don&#39;t see the problem with being that generous with addresses.",

I will just mention the fact that we&#39;ve easily thrown away half of the IPv6 address (nobody will ever persuade me that you truly need a /64 for every subnet) and that it looks like we&#39;re ready to part with another 16 bits. Obviously the 128-bit address is too mind boggling ;) and we have to cut it down to manageable size.<br /><br />As for &quot;MANY good reasons to give them /48&quot;, I would kindly ask you to give me a few - I always love to reduce my ignorance.<br /><br />Last but not least, I&#39;m somewhat tired of hearing how this-or-that is stifling innovation. There are many things that have that effect, but 8 bits in IPv6 address is definitely not on my list of those things. Even the numerous broken NAT implementations were not able to stifle innovation when people really wanted to roll out exciting new products or services.",

      "html": "One pont I will make on IPv6 NAT,<br /><br />  One of my many interests is in embedded Linux.  Just about all run-from-rom devices that use it these days (whether they admit it or not, and most do) are built around Linux, particularly modified Debian 2.4 kernels with various hacked up versions of busybox, wrapped in a webinterface.  And not just router CPEs I&#39;m talking, also NASs and a whole lot of other stuff out there.  (tv sets, cable modems, DSL modems, etc.)  The SOHO router stuff hitting the market today is more and more 2.6 kernels now but all of them chintz enormously on the amount of flash.  4MB is still almost always used but some of the better gear uses 8MB.  And 32MB of ram is usually a max also.<br /><br />Anyway, with all due respect to the OpenBSD pf NAT66 implementation, you simply aren&#39;t going to see NAT66 in these inexpensive SOHO CPE devices until it&#39;s integrated into iptables, into the standard distro.  And the only alpha-quality NAT66 implementation out there for iptables is http://map66.sourceforge.net/    That one was written more from a &quot;prove it can be done&quot; than anything else, and the developer has already said he&#39;s not going to do anything more on it for now.<br /><br />These manufactures - and you can include Cisco with it&#39;s Linksys and &quot;SOHO Business Routers&quot; like the RVS4000 - simply aren&#39;t going to put in experimental modules into iptables for their devices.  The chance of an undetected memory leak is high and it&#39;s not like your running on a PC with 4GB of ram where a few bytes of leakage can go for months if not years before it becomes a problem.  And they aren&#39;t going to sink development dollars into it either - the entire point of using Linux on these devices in the first place is to leverage other people&#39;s work, particularly the Linux developers.  Besides that they have enough problems with dealing with the chip vendors like Broadcom, Intel, Atheros, and so on, removing bugs from their hardware drivers and integrating them into the embedded linux code they are using.<br /><br />So, in summary you might possibly see a NAT66 implementation in a Cisco or Juniper $10,000.00 router or a $5K firewall from Checkpoint or some such, but you won&#39;t see it in Ma and Pa Kettle&#39;s home cable modem until the major Linux distros adopt it - and the iptables developers won&#39;t accept anything like that until the IETF has agreed on a standard and a lot of people in the community have put time into beating on someone&#39;s set of patches.  And that would be years from now even if a solid set of patches adding NAT66 into iptables existed today.",

      "html": "Well, throwing away only half of the IPv6 addresses would be more than excellent. But unfortunately this is no place for logarithmic thinking! Assuming there is a sense for 16 bits for the host in a subnet (probably it isn&#39;t, but ...), we have thrown away (2^48-1)/2^48 of addresses. That is more than 99.999999999999 % of them. Neglecting those puny 0.000000000001 % of addresses we have actually thrown away the whole IPv6 Internet. :-(",

      "html": "Well, to be honest you can run IPv6 with low lifetimes in your prefix announcements, so your hosts will forget it quickly when they don&#39;t hear news from your residential DSL router.  And, as far as I heard, it&#39;s not supposed to change every night, but it&#39;s not a contractually guaranteed fixed prefix.  So yeah, when they decide to renumber in an area, you need to adjust.  (After all, the assignment part is dynamic thanks to DHCPv6-PD.)",
