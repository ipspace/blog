            <div class="comment-content">An interesting perspective, but there are several factual errors. The biggest one is at the end. There has been no activity on 802.1Qau since the end of 2009 because we finished balloting on the draft then. IEEE Std 802.1Qau became an approved standard March 2010 and is published so there is no more work for us to do on it. <br /><br />Your first note about buffer credit is incorrect. Buffer-to-buffer credit in Fibre Channel is the credit mechanism used hop by hop to ensure that the next device has buffer available before a frame is sent. In FCoE, PFC is used instead and there is no buffer-to-buffer credit. End-to-end credit is used for some Fibre Channel classes but not by Class 3 which is the class that will generally be used with FCoE. (Class 2 is used by some protocols running over FC for establishing connections but generally not for bulk data transfer.) Therefore, the situation in your example is not prevented by FCoE.<br /><br />While practical implementation of CN generally will require some hardware support, 802.1Qau is designed to minimize the amount of state needed so it shouldn&#39;t be expensive to implement. The biggest unknown is regarding the persistence of congestion in the data center. It takes time for CN messages to be generated and slow down the sources. If congestion is very brief, the congestion could be over before CNMs arrive to quench it. If congestion is persistent, then CN will be useful.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Update: Blog post fixed ... but I simply have to point out the underlying cause of the &quot;802.1Qau is stalled&quot; error. <br /><br />Looking at various IEEE web pages (including 802.1 main web page, DCB page or 802.1Qau page) I couldn&#39;t find a way to figure out that 802.1Qau is an approved standard. Now that I know what state it&#39;s i, it was trivial to find it on GetIEEE site  :&#39;( . Lesson learned.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I dint get it. What is the difference b/w PFC &amp; CN? Take PFC: Why doesnt switch A send PAUSE to server S. Isnt PFC also moving the congestion to the edge? Storage array D sends PFC, which causes switch B to send PFC. Why does the same logic not apply to switch A?</div>
