      "html": "A concern that I would have with this configuration is what would happen if the box reloads between 17:01 and 07:59. The default state would mean that the route would be up. As the EEM is event-basedd, no event would be triggered until the next morning. Routing will then happen over the tunnel during a time frame where it shouldn&#39;t. Something like this might be a more robust solution:<br /><br />access-list 100 permit ip any any time-range time1<br /> !<br /> route-map default permit 10<br /> match ip address 100<br /> set interface Tunnel0<br /> !<br /> !<br /> time-range time1<br /> periodic daily 8:00 to 17:00<br /> !<br /> interface FastEthernet0/0<br /> ip policy route-map default",
