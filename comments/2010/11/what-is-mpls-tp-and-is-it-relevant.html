            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />How do you thing about the OTS - with enhanced ethernet services deployment in enterprise or university? Basically ROADM with integrated ethernet switch on traditional node rooms, only two powerful routes/firewalls in datacenters with ring topology to each node rooms which will be layer 2 switched.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Schilling</div>

            <div class="comment-content">On serious note, I wish you could provide some SONET/SDH vs MPLS-TP comparison. To me neither T-MPLS nor PBB-TE (it&#39;s less &quot;successful&quot; peer ;) make much sense for an operator providing circuit transportation services. Bandwidth efficiency? Come one, VCAT/LCAS make SDH circuits pretty flexible. Packet services? MPLS-TP provides PWE3 services and.. that appears to be it. How is that significantly better than TDM circuits? If a carrier is looking toward proving rich packet services then it makes more sense to run a time-proven IP/MPLS network core. Lastly, speaking of MPLS-TP OAM-P features designed similar to SONET/SDH standards: if we are making PSN that similar to TDM, maybe there is no reason to bother with it and stick with TDM in the first place?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Infinera is all based on GMPLS for the control plane - in fact you can&#39;t implement it without.  I am under the impression that Infinera is in most large carriers and web services at this point.  Their PIC technology outperforms everything else in the optical market right now.  I personally am using the equipment at a relatively large MSO and it&#39;s, hands down, the best platform out there.  All of our Nortel gear is being replaced with it.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Petr,<br /><br />Although this is a reply that comes more than half a year late, I hope you will still get to read it :)<br /><br />I believe that the point of MPLS-TP is having a telco-kind of management and control above the network. From the service point of view, there is no difference to MPLS or MPLS-TP or T-MPLS... every one of them uses the label stack precisely in the same way. In my opinion, the difference is how do the labels (and LSPs and all the stuff) get set up in the first place, and intelligence on LSRs is needed for that.<br /><br />We already have quite a lot of label-disseminating protocols: LDP, RSVP, BGP, the first two of them being heavily dependent on IGP routing protocols. Providers routinely dislike running RSVP in their networks, even if for sole purposes of MPLS-TE. So in order to actually set up a LSP, there is a lot of work to do in the control plane of a router, and synchronizing this work among lots of routers is a nontrivial task.<br /><br />The other observation is that a LSR actually does not need IP for most of its data plane operations, as it is concerned with labeled packets most of the time. All the hassle with IP-based protocols is just to create the label bindings - and then, you can theoretically get rid of the IP stuff as long as you have your LFIB populated with correct entries.<br /><br />In telco network, the idea of a management network above the managed nodes, and the managed nodes being &quot;fast and stupid&quot;, has its advantages. A central node managing the network allows for complex and extensive path creation and selection between nodes because it is performed as a centralized computation, as opposed to all nodes in the network performing this computation in a distributed manner, without having a centralized point of command. This is where I see the MPLS-TP step in: as a means of controlling the LSP creation and management and removing the IP-based control plane from the network nodes and centralizing it in a single control element who is in charge of all network nodes. For example, the MPLS-TE is a complicated thing to do if lots of tunnels are to be configured in a regular MPLS network. The MPLS-TP could solve this quite easily, as all the hassle of OSPF-TE or ISIS-TE combined with RSVP-TE would simply not be necessary.<br /><br />I also think that nobody is trying to reinvent the TDM or SDH by MPLS-TP. Surely, the underlying technology under MPLS is mostly packet-based, so it is almost impossible inherently to maintain the time division aspect of any TDM/SDH network. What we are getting at with MPLS-TP is having more controlled environment where the LSPs are built not by cooperation of network nodes like in today&#39;s MPLS networks, but rather by a centralized control. Reminds me slightly of LWAP/CAPWAP (although they centralize both data and control plane).<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Peter</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I recently started looking at MPLS-TP as part of adding OAM support for the same. Wondering just what&#39;s different from creating plain old static LSPs (say by this method on cisco: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/mpls/command/reference/mp_m2.html#wp1060671)<br /><br />Granted, MPLS-TP also says you can use GMPLS but the &#39;static&#39; way seems to be already there...?
