            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan , there are some beta projects on Junos 10.4 and XRE200 since August. I think the key challenge in &quot;virtual link aggregation&quot; techniques  is really the layer 2 forwarding part , especially when it comes to forward the traffic within the same broadcast domain. <br />Depending on the type of Ethernet frame arriving on the incoming interface of the switch the hashing is done in 2 different ways: <br />a/  If the packet is non IP, the hashing is done on src and dst MAC <br />addresses (for example FCoE snooped traffic )  , check also how many bits of the MAC address are really taken for the hash <br />b/  If the packet is IP, the hashing is done only on the L3 and L4 fields: <br />- IP Source Address <br />- IP Dest Address <br />- Src Port (L4 SrcPort)<br />- Src Dest (L4 DstPort)<br /><br />Sometimes you can run into some performance degradation issues if  the flows are not varying enough on the mentioned above values.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">That capability has been available for quite a while; the problem is that the second supervisor in the chassis has to reload once the first one fails, bringing the whole chassis (and half of VSS) down for quite a while.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan<br />do u know what happen if XRE200 is failure. I can not find any failure scenario document about this like cisco vss white paper in juniper. Juniper just recommend two XRE200 for HA, but not as a requirement. So if just equipped ONE XRE200 in virtual chassis, what happen with these two chassises? one still active and another become dead to prevent loop or .......?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">No idea. Best-case the switches would continue to forward traffic based on existing forwarding tables (and hopefully XRE200 would recover). Worst case, you&#39;d have three dead boxes.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">First of all Ivan the diagram representing the 8200 VC is incomplete, ideally there is a direct link b/w the two XREs over which only control plane information is exchanged, this gives it the true control plane redundancy and avoids the VSS like brain dead scenario that you mentioned in:-<br /> &quot;Furthermore, losing the inter-switch link between two Catalysts in a VSS system is equivalent to losing all the connections between the left- and right-hand sides in the above diagram, in which case the virtual chassis is at least as brain-dead as VSS &quot;<br /><br />also your folllowing observation is not entirely correct at least for the XRE:-<br />&quot;not only are you lobotomizing one supervisor module, you have to buy two more and lobotomize three out of four&quot;<br />Juniper VC comes  with a lot of HA features like GRES(graceful RE switchover),NSR(non-stop routing) and NSB (non-stop bridgiging) which gives you near hitless data convergence during RE failures and ISSU, the NSR and NSB features are implemented by running the same daemons responsible for routing,bridging snooping and other features parallely on the backup xre and syncing the kernel periodically with the master, so in case of a xre switchover you have all the protocol states intact in the backup which then takes over seamlessly &amp; masks this transition to its peers, so replicating  and concurrently running the daemons on the backup XRE isnt exactly same as lobotomizing it<br /><br />also w.r.t to your observation:-<br />&quot; once they manage to implement a reliable system beyond the two chassis, it will be a truly interesting solution.&quot; i would like you to know that the VC has been succesfuly tested with 4 members and is currently being tested with 8 members</div>

            <div class="comment-content">#1 - Agree with the &quot;missing link&quot; observation, although it doesn&#39;t change much. Conceptually it&#39;s still the same thing as VSS with multiple parallel links - if all links between left and right side fail, you have a problem. No way around that.<br /><br />#2 - &quot;Lobotomizing supervisors&quot;: I see your point. It would be interesting to compare that with NSF from Cisco (VSS). Any good comparison documents or technical deep dive?<br /><br />#3 - I know the 4-chassis solution is supported now (thanks for pointing that out). That will be covered in the upcoming update to the Data Center Fabric Architectures webinar.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan, a few more points that i would like to make w.r.t your reply are :-<br /><br />#1 - w.r.t the missing link we should note that there are now 2 different points of failure i.e 1. &quot;the direct link b/w the xres that is only for control traffic&quot;  &amp;  2. the intra chassis lag link b/w the chassis that is for both control+data traffic, hence for the failure you initialy pointed out to happen both these points should fail at the same time, if only the missing link fails the xres could still sync with each other through the intra chassis link,  when the intra chassis link fails in which case data traffic cannot move across chassis  both xres would still be in sync so only traffic that has to be switched across chassis is affected not the traffic that has ingress/egress on same cahssis<br />#1-1: also  with the 4 chassis implementation the intra chassis links can be fully meshed b/w each of <br />          the members therby providing multiple redundant intra chassis path<br /><br />#2 - w.r.t NSF i dont know much about it but AFAIK it still doesnt concurrently run the exact same <br />daemons on both the master and backup and hence it needs the help of NSF aware (cisco) neighbors to maintain or rather rebuild the protocol states whereas the forwarding states are maintained, plz correct me on this if i am mistaken. in case of Juniper HA the backup RE is exactly running the same processes as the master and hence there is no need for repopulating RIB or anything and the forwarding states that are maintained in the Kernel are synced across the master and backup, the PFE (packet forwarding engine) on the LC keeps forwarding the packets hitlessly in case there is no protocol triggered change during the switchover, so you actually get a 0(zero) packet drop scenario when there is no protocol triggered changes happening during switchover. <br />#2-2 Also the major difference here is that the Juniper HA mechanism is local to the system and doesnt need any awareness capability from peer , the peer can be any system be it Cisco, Juniper or HP</div>
