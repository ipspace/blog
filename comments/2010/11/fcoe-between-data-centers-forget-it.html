            <div class="comment-content">Ivan,<br />There&#39;s a fundamental problem with your argument.  The answer is not that FCoE becomes the only protocol for all environments, but that FCoE is a path to allow for a converged Ethernet infrastructure.  We&#39;re getting to the point where the line between FC and Ethernet is blurring (Cisco&#39;s Unified Ports and HP&#39;s Flex Ports) on the switch and on the adapters (CNAs), you&#39;ll be able to choose your Ethernet protocol*s* of choice whether it is FCoE, iSCSI or other IP traffic.  Replication solutions are usually separate links from the rest of the traffic, so having a different protocol (such as iSCSI rather than FCoE) from the same port is not a limitation.  Yes, FCoE is limited to layer 2 - the same companies that have created FC extension solutions are looking at stretching FCoE.  iSCSI is a good replication technology and there are many FC environments today that use iSCSI solely for replication, so having the same mix of FCoE and iSCSI seems very reasonable.<br />Stu<br />Wikibon.org</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Stuart,<br /><br />the technical part of my argument has no problem (fundamental or otherwise), PFC is not a long-distance technology ... but I admit there is a bait at the end of the post ;)<br /><br />FCoE is a great technology when you want to integrate new servers with legacy FC infrastructure, but not more than that. As for whether FCoE could scale better than iSCSI, that deserves a separate post.<br /><br />Ivan</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Supported distance for FCoE is now 3km and it will be really difficult to extend it further without hardware modification.<br />Still, nowhere near close original FC.<br /><br />K</div>

            <div class="comment-content">After years of purchasing the various flavors of WAN and Ethernet LAN Extension services from the local telco we were presented with the oppurtunity to lease pairs of (dark fiber i.e. we light it) from the Electric Utility. This utility has &quot;state: wide right of way and access and they have installed lots of fiber everywhere there is electric service.<br />The only mistake we made was to not grab as many pairs as we could get.<br />We have  4 major sites within a 100 km radius of the city that are dual fiber pair connected.<br />We also have the option to purchase &quot;Ethernet&quot; services from the Electric Utility as well as the Telco for areas that are unlikely to be long term sites.<br />We are using DWDM gear (Passive MUX) (Glorified wire extension)<br />We are able to run:<br />1)Multiple isolated instances of varying speed Ethernet using any mix of vendor ethernet gear we like. We do not need to buy DWDM optics from Ethernet Switch vendors. :)<br />2) Multiple instances of multifabric FC (4/8/16Gb does not matter)<br />3) Multiple instances of Analog Security Camera Video and camera control signalling.<br />4) Have many free lambdas for other services. If a DWDM sevice card is available for a service we can run it.<br />5) Our is passive so it does not care whoose equipment you coonnect(Right Lambda in right lambda out the opposite end. <br />6) We can spin up test instances any time we like w/o impacting production.<br /><br />So do we care about &quot;Converged Ethernet&quot;? A: No, but it is an entertaining movie.<br />Is having your own fiber cheaper? Do you really need an answer to that. Obviously this does not fit in a multi state, multi country use case scenario. It sure is entertaining to have the convergence sales dudes come knocking and try to sell us a spin.<br /><br />Do we like FC over DWDM? Yes<br />Do we like Ethernet over DWDM Yes<br />Do we like Analog Video over DWDM Yes<br />Do we like Digital Video over DWDM yes<br /><br />It was great to be in the DWDM business before the Telco was.<br />There are some very interesting DWDM service cards and devices available.</div>
