  html: An interesting perspective, but there are several factual errors. The biggest
    one is at the end. There has been no activity on 802.1Qau since the end of 2009
    because we finished balloting on the draft then. IEEE Std 802.1Qau became an approved
    standard March 2010 and is published so there is no more work for us to do on
    it. <br /><br />Your first note about buffer credit is incorrect. Buffer-to-buffer
    credit in Fibre Channel is the credit mechanism used hop by hop to ensure that
    the next device has buffer available before a frame is sent. In FCoE, PFC is used
    instead and there is no buffer-to-buffer credit. End-to-end credit is used for
    some Fibre Channel classes but not by Class 3 which is the class that will generally
    be used with FCoE. (Class 2 is used by some protocols running over FC for establishing
    connections but generally not for bulk data transfer.) Therefore, the situation
    in your example is not prevented by FCoE.<br /><br />While practical implementation
    of CN generally will require some hardware support, 802.1Qau is designed to minimize
    the amount of state needed so it shouldn&#39;t be expensive to implement. The
    biggest unknown is regarding the persistence of congestion in the data center.
    It takes time for CN messages to be generated and slow down the sources. If congestion
    is very brief, the congestion could be over before CNMs arrive to quench it. If
    congestion is persistent, then CN will be useful.

  html: You&#39;re absolutely correct. Thank you immensely for your feedback ... comments
    like yours help me keep my blog technically correct. Will rewrite the post.<br

  html: 'Update: Blog post fixed ... but I simply have to point out the underlying
    cause of the &quot;802.1Qau is stalled&quot; error. <br /><br />Looking at various
    IEEE web pages (including 802.1 main web page, DCB page or 802.1Qau page) I couldn&#39;t
    find a way to figure out that 802.1Qau is an approved standard. Now that I know
    what state it&#39;s i, it was trivial to find it on GetIEEE site  :&#39;( . Lesson
    learned.'

  html: 'I dint get it. What is the difference b/w PFC &amp; CN? Take PFC: Why doesnt
    switch A send PAUSE to server S. Isnt PFC also moving the congestion to the edge?
    Storage array D sends PFC, which causes switch B to send PFC. Why does the same
    logic not apply to switch A?'
