  html: Ivan,<br />There&#39;s a fundamental problem with your argument.  The answer
    is not that FCoE becomes the only protocol for all environments, but that FCoE
    is a path to allow for a converged Ethernet infrastructure.  We&#39;re getting
    to the point where the line between FC and Ethernet is blurring (Cisco&#39;s Unified
    Ports and HP&#39;s Flex Ports) on the switch and on the adapters (CNAs), you&#39;ll
    be able to choose your Ethernet protocol*s* of choice whether it is FCoE, iSCSI
    or other IP traffic.  Replication solutions are usually separate links from the
    rest of the traffic, so having a different protocol (such as iSCSI rather than
    FCoE) from the same port is not a limitation.  Yes, FCoE is limited to layer 2
    - the same companies that have created FC extension solutions are looking at stretching
    FCoE.  iSCSI is a good replication technology and there are many FC environments
    today that use iSCSI solely for replication, so having the same mix of FCoE and
    iSCSI seems very reasonable.<br />Stu<br />Wikibon.org

  html: Stuart,<br /><br />the technical part of my argument has no problem (fundamental
    or otherwise), PFC is not a long-distance technology ... but I admit there is
    a bait at the end of the post ;)<br /><br />FCoE is a great technology when you
    want to integrate new servers with legacy FC infrastructure, but not more than
    that. As for whether FCoE could scale better than iSCSI, that deserves a separate
    post.<br /><br />Ivan

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Supported distance for FCoE is now 3km and it will be
    really difficult to extend it further without hardware modification.<br />Still,
    nowhere near close original FC.<br /><br />K

  html: 'Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Apparently, Nexus 5xxx to 5xxx can do 3 km (which is
    still too close, but at least it *can* be a different DC now! :) Not sure if this
    is a recent change though.<br /><br />See here: https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-15882'

  html: Updating myself. Yuck.<br />F1 card (N7k) can do 20km (2.3MB buffer/port),
    will be able to do 40km.<br /><br />But for 5k - 3km. If you do the math, it&#39;s
    close to the limit (well, theoretically 5-6km could do but it&#39;d be ugly).

  html: 'After years of purchasing the various flavors of WAN and Ethernet LAN Extension
    services from the local telco we were presented with the oppurtunity to lease
    pairs of (dark fiber i.e. we light it) from the Electric Utility. This utility
    has &quot;state: wide right of way and access and they have installed lots of
    fiber everywhere there is electric service.<br />The only mistake we made was
    to not grab as many pairs as we could get.<br />We have  4 major sites within
    a 100 km radius of the city that are dual fiber pair connected.<br />We also have
    the option to purchase &quot;Ethernet&quot; services from the Electric Utility
    as well as the Telco for areas that are unlikely to be long term sites.<br />We
    are using DWDM gear (Passive MUX) (Glorified wire extension)<br />We are able
    to run:<br />1)Multiple isolated instances of varying speed Ethernet using any
    mix of vendor ethernet gear we like. We do not need to buy DWDM optics from Ethernet
    Switch vendors. :)<br />2) Multiple instances of multifabric FC (4/8/16Gb does
    not matter)<br />3) Multiple instances of Analog Security Camera Video and camera
    control signalling.<br />4) Have many free lambdas for other services. If a DWDM
    sevice card is available for a service we can run it.<br />5) Our is passive so
    it does not care whoose equipment you coonnect(Right Lambda in right lambda out
    the opposite end. <br />6) We can spin up test instances any time we like w/o
    impacting production.<br /><br />So do we care about &quot;Converged Ethernet&quot;?
    A: No, but it is an entertaining movie.<br />Is having your own fiber cheaper?
    Do you really need an answer to that. Obviously this does not fit in a multi state,
    multi country use case scenario. It sure is entertaining to have the convergence
    sales dudes come knocking and try to sell us a spin.<br /><br />Do we like FC
    over DWDM? Yes<br />Do we like Ethernet over DWDM Yes<br />Do we like Analog Video
    over DWDM Yes<br />Do we like Digital Video over DWDM yes<br /><br />It was great
    to be in the DWDM business before the Telco was.<br />There are some very interesting
    DWDM service cards and devices available.'
