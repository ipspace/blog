      "html": "I have been managing some of my production devices recently over IPv6, including SNMP. Had no issues so far. Though, some needed the upgrade to the latest IOS to work well.<br /><br />I agree, to some extent not everything is ready yet, but it is still absolutely necessary to take the small steps so the issues could be identified early. I prefer to leave the IPv4 management as a backup solution.",

      "html": "The relevance of using IPv6 for management should indeed be taken with more attention. Even when perhaps not so poular for techo guys, but from business perspective it could always be that business managent would like to consider handing the network monitoring or management to some other company, in which case not needing to deal with private Ip addresses and NAT is quite some advantage. In XaaS parlance, this would be NMaaS :-)<br />However, for this to work, not only the network elements must properly support IPv6 in all management protocols, but also management/monitoring tools and apps must also support IPv6.. Does anyone have more experiences in this respect?",
