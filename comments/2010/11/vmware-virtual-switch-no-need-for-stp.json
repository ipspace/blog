They use mac-pinning on the uplinks and you can selectively choose which VLANs actively traverse each link if you so wish. Any particular reason you didn&#39;t use the term mac-pinning?",

      "html": "I&#39;ve seen some recommendations about enabling bpduguard with ESX before, but could never get an answer to my concern...What happens with spoofed bdpu frames from a VM? Assuming ESX forwards the bpdu frame, the switch will err-disable the interface due to bpduguard, then ESX will move the VM to the next interface, which err-disables as soon as it sees a bpdu, and so on until all interfaces are err-disabled.  If the ESX host is in an HA cluster, when it becomes isolated because all interfaces are disabled, VMware HA will kick in, shutdown the VMs, and start the VMs on another host.  At that point, the VM sending bpdus would isolate that that host as well and trigger another HA event.  Soon, all the interfaces connected to the entire cluster would be err-disabled and none of the VMs would be powered up (due to the final HA event).<br /><br />Of course, if ESX doesn&#39;t forward the bpdus from a VM, then none of that happens and enabling bpduguard is safe. Definitely not worth the risk until I&#39;m sure, though! :)",
