  html: I feel like a total idiot asking this, but, where do I need to log in to gain
    access to your new webinar management system?<br /><br />I attended the DMVPN
    Crazy and Advanced Scenarios on 7/7/2010 and was hoping to gain access to the
    new content you&#39;ve added around EIGRP and BGP for today&#39;s revised webinar
    (11/3/2010). Thanks!

  html: No. Great idea, but unfortunately the sales volume is way too low to justify
    that investment.<br /><br />Would you know someone who could do subtitling as
    a service?

  html: Suggest hiring a mechanical turk over at Amazon to do the subtitling/timecoding
    work for you? https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome  If they can make SRT (subrip
    format) subtitles, there are ways to include it in the video.
