  html: Hi Ivan<br /><br />This sounds like the same technology they use in UCS integral
    nexus &#39;interconnect&#39;. They use mac-pinning on the uplinks and you can
    selectively choose which VLANs actively traverse each link if you so wish. Any
    particular reason you didn&#39;t use the term mac-pinning?

  html: Are you talking about UCS interconnect (6100) or UCS fabric extender (2100)?
    UCS interconnect can work in &quot;End host mode&quot;, which I&#39;ve mentioned
    at the beginning.<br /><br />The &quot;Mac pinning&quot; is just one of the possible
    load balancing methods vSwitch can use. VMware uses the descriptive term &quot;Route
    based on source MAC hash&quot;.

  html: I&#39;m talking about the 6100 yeah. I&#39;m not sure if they have different
    configurable load balancing methods too, I thought mac pinning was the only option
    to be honest.

  html: I&#39;ve seen some recommendations about enabling bpduguard with ESX before,
    but could never get an answer to my concern...What happens with spoofed bdpu frames
    from a VM? Assuming ESX forwards the bpdu frame, the switch will err-disable the
    interface due to bpduguard, then ESX will move the VM to the next interface, which
    err-disables as soon as it sees a bpdu, and so on until all interfaces are err-disabled.  If
    the ESX host is in an HA cluster, when it becomes isolated because all interfaces
    are disabled, VMware HA will kick in, shutdown the VMs, and start the VMs on another
    host.  At that point, the VM sending bpdus would isolate that that host as well
    and trigger another HA event.  Soon, all the interfaces connected to the entire
    cluster would be err-disabled and none of the VMs would be powered up (due to
    the final HA event).<br /><br />Of course, if ESX doesn&#39;t forward the bpdus
    from a VM, then none of that happens and enabling bpduguard is safe. Definitely
    not worth the risk until I&#39;m sure, though! :)

  html: A VM may send traffic with a different source MAC than its MAC known to vSphere
    (e. g. Microsoft NLB). In such a case, I&#39;ve experienced that Nexus 1000V learns
    it and places dynamic entries in the MAC address table.
