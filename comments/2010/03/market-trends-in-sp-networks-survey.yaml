  html: nice results.. but quick question based on human nature and certainly not
    taking anything away from your skill :-).. but I always wondered...<br /><br />Once
    in a course or similar and you get to know someone it becomes v difficult to give
    bad results, in particular, if it is life effecting in some way such as bonuses
    or future work etc. In fact one can argue that you should get high results just
    for high effort  with integrity.<br /><br />I know in ciscoland for bingos, once
    i realised bonuses were based on them I was always going to give 5s if possible
    for any competent+ work,  despite my anti communism feelings.<br /><br />maybe
    its just me?
