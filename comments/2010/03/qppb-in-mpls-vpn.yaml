    you know, sir, that the politically-correct term for this disability is &quot;differently

  html: Ivan, this is an old post, but, do you have any examples or just thoughts
    on MPLS Inter-AS Option C. Does it really saves all the operational work? Is it

  html: Inter-AS Option C is used in practice and is definitely a better option than
    (A). Whether you prefer (B) or (C) depends on what you want to ASBR routers to
    do and how much you trust the other AS.
