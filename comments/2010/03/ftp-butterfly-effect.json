It wouldn&#39;t function through a simple NAT, so I captured a few packets and searched for the hex encoding of the device&#39;s IPv4 address in the packet payload... and there it was. You would think that vendors in 2010 would at least try to use SIP or H.323 or something that firewalls can deal with, but in this case they decided to re-invent the square wheel.",

It was possible to copy files between two computers using third &quot;control&quot; computer. ex: there is a fast line between computers A and B. You are sitting on computer C with very slow line. Is there a way how to copy files from A to B fast? Guess what - FTP can do it! ;-)<br /><br />And why FTP can do it? There are 2 reasons - it uses 2 ports (20,21) AND it has destination IP address embedded in protocol! (ok, there is third reason - it uses server iniciated file transfer)",

      "html": "#1 - Agreed. However, introducing chunking would not make for a significantly more complex protocol. It&#39;s easier, though, to think about opening two sessions if your model is &quot;end-to-end connectivity with no limitations&quot;. Once that model breaks down (due to security restrictions or NAT), we&#39;re all in deep trouble.<br /><br />#2 - You might have a problem with ivory-tower &quot;professionals&quot; (so do I), but sometimes it helps to spend some time thinking about the bigger picture and have a structured model of what you&#39;re trying to do. Most &quot;senior&quot; disciplines do (for example, the architects have learned their lessons after &quot;a few&quot; broken bridges and/or buildings), in the networking world some people still think doing just-in-time hacks beat proper engineering. It does in the short term ... and causes everyone needlesss pain in the long term.<br /><br />As for FXP: it&#39;s awesome. Thanks for pointing me to this little gem. Do you have any real-life usage examples?<br /><br />#3: The problems with FTP (and my grudges against it) are 20+ years old. At the time when we had to implement the first firewalls and the first NAT devices, PASV transfers were not available everywhere. Anyhow, PASV transfer just shifts the burden to the other end.<br /><br />Last but not least, I don&#39;t care about FTP per-se; I am in this industry long enough to have some perspective (I would hope) ... you did read my CV before writing that last line, did you? My point was that the bad practices promoted by FTP were picked up by numerous other protocols and made firewalls and NAT devices way more complex than they would have to be if some people would listen to &quot;academic trivia&quot; every now and then.",

      "html": "Well, the original RFC 114 has neither PASV nor FXP functionality. Both appeared (approximately) nine years later in RFC 765, so the server-to-server copy was definitely not in the minds of people designing FTP.<br /><br />As for the later chicken-and-egg problem, it could be that someone figured out the PASV functionality is needed (to make packet filters work) and then someone else said &quot;wait, with a nice hack, we could have server-to-server transfers&quot; ... or someone wanted to have server-to-server transfers, implemented PASV and then other people figured out it could be used to make packet filters simpler.<br /><br />I have no background information whatsoever (it would be nice to have it), but I suspect the FXP was there first, as many FTP clients did not support PASV when I started implementing firewalls (you know, the &quot;traditional&quot; two-routers-and-a-host-in-between type of firewalls).",
