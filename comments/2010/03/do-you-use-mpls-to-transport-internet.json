This will help SP not to add any IGP for IPv6 traffic. <br />I have added a HLD for the same on blog http://www.mplsvpn.info/2010/03/ipv6-internet-in-vrf-over-mpls.html<br /><br />Challenges:-<br />1. The first challenge is the DNS. In that case we need to use the two interface on DNS one for forwarding and another for reverse. <br />2. Proxy.<br /><br />I am also working on the solutions. Will come up with new updates  :)",

      "html": "This seems to be an OR poll..  The previous provider I worked at did 2 of the options and  the third was considered in one of the Sub-AS. <br /><br />6PE w MPLS on P Nodes &amp;  Natively w BGP on P node. 6VPE considered but not sure of outcome.<br /><br />V4 is the same which the v6 topology followed.. In fact, in my experience (And I am pure Core guy ie. no dns/nat/cpes) deploying IPv6 was as easy as another address family.<br /><br />In mobile operators I have only seen Internet in VPN and am yet to see v6 just massive NAT boxes (which imo is bottleneck)<br /><br />In the end the decision must come down to whether you already have a BGP Free Core or not.<br /><br />As a corollary,there is an argument that we buy all the super powered CRS/T1600 etc and then remove BGP from the core. In reality if they are so super (and expensive) there surely adding BGP to the core should be a walk in the park for these big boys ;-)",
