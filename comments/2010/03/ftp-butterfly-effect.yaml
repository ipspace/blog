  html: I ran into a recently-coded version of this problem just the other day with
    a proprietary, vertical market VoIP appliance. It wouldn&#39;t function through
    a simple NAT, so I captured a few packets and searched for the hex encoding of
    the device&#39;s IPv4 address in the packet payload... and there it was. You would
    think that vendors in 2010 would at least try to use SIP or H.323 or something
    that firewalls can deal with, but in this case they decided to re-invent the square
    wheel.

  html: IPv6 will arrive when FTP will dead.<br />It&#39;s better the worst standard
    wide accpeted than the best propietary solution ever created.<br />But FTP is
    my worst nighmare from a long long time ago. Last problem with a load balancer
    was related to the balancing of this protocol.<br />I agree all the post. From
    tip to toe.

  html: 'I think you don&#39;t get the idea of FTP protocol. It was possible to copy
    files between two computers using third &quot;control&quot; computer. ex: there
    is a fast line between computers A and B. You are sitting on computer C with very
    slow line. Is there a way how to copy files from A to B fast? Guess what - FTP
    can do it! ;-)<br /><br />And why FTP can do it? There are 2 reasons - it uses
    2 ports (20,21) AND it has destination IP address embedded in protocol! (ok, there
    is third reason - it uses server iniciated file transfer)'

  html: '&gt; Command and data streams use separate sessions.<br /><br />There are
    very good reasons for having separate TCP sessions for data and control messages.  It
    allows cancelling transfers without having to tear down and reestablish the entire
    connection; doing this with a single stream requires a significantly more complex
    protocol.<br /><br />&gt; Layer-3 addresses and layer-4 port numbers are carried
    in layer-7 messages.<br /><br />It&#39;s hard to take anyone seriously who talks
    about &quot;layer 3&quot; and &quot;layer 7&quot; as if they&#39;re something
    other than academic trivia.  It&#39;s perfectly normal to pass ports and IPs through
    control sessions.<br /><br />And as davro pointed out, you completely ignored
    (and were probably ignorant of) the benefit of FXP.<br /><br />&gt; FTP server
    opens a reverse session to a dynamic port assigned by the FTP client.<br /><br
    />All sane, modern FTP clients default to PASV transfers.<br /><br />This post
    is nothing but attacking a mature protocol based on the notion that &quot;it&#39;s
    been around for a long time, therefore it must be horribly broken&quot;.  Very
    poor.'

  html: Thanks for the feedback. The server-to-server copy is awesome engineering.
    Would you have any indication that it was done by design (or was someone clever
    enough to figure out how to use existing functionality)?

  html: '#1 - Agreed. However, introducing chunking would not make for a significantly
    more complex protocol. It&#39;s easier, though, to think about opening two sessions
    if your model is &quot;end-to-end connectivity with no limitations&quot;. Once
    that model breaks down (due to security restrictions or NAT), we&#39;re all in
    deep trouble.<br /><br />#2 - You might have a problem with ivory-tower &quot;professionals&quot;
    (so do I), but sometimes it helps to spend some time thinking about the bigger
    picture and have a structured model of what you&#39;re trying to do. Most &quot;senior&quot;
    disciplines do (for example, the architects have learned their lessons after &quot;a
    few&quot; broken bridges and/or buildings), in the networking world some people
    still think doing just-in-time hacks beat proper engineering. It does in the short
    term ... and causes everyone needlesss pain in the long term.<br /><br />As for
    FXP: it&#39;s awesome. Thanks for pointing me to this little gem. Do you have
    any real-life usage examples?<br /><br />#3: The problems with FTP (and my grudges
    against it) are 20+ years old. At the time when we had to implement the first
    firewalls and the first NAT devices, PASV transfers were not available everywhere.
    Anyhow, PASV transfer just shifts the burden to the other end.<br /><br />Last
    but not least, I don&#39;t care about FTP per-se; I am in this industry long enough
    to have some perspective (I would hope) ... you did read my CV before writing
    that last line, did you? My point was that the bad practices promoted by FTP were
    picked up by numerous other protocols and made firewalls and NAT devices way more
    complex than they would have to be if some people would listen to &quot;academic
    trivia&quot; every now and then.'

  html: Well, the original RFC 114 has neither PASV nor FXP functionality. Both appeared
    (approximately) nine years later in RFC 765, so the server-to-server copy was
    definitely not in the minds of people designing FTP.<br /><br />As for the later
    chicken-and-egg problem, it could be that someone figured out the PASV functionality
    is needed (to make packet filters work) and then someone else said &quot;wait,
    with a nice hack, we could have server-to-server transfers&quot; ... or someone
    wanted to have server-to-server transfers, implemented PASV and then other people
    figured out it could be used to make packet filters simpler.<br /><br />I have
    no background information whatsoever (it would be nice to have it), but I suspect
    the FXP was there first, as many FTP clients did not support PASV when I started
    implementing firewalls (you know, the &quot;traditional&quot; two-routers-and-a-host-in-between
    type of firewalls).

  html: Sorry, but RFC 114 doesn&#39;t describe same protocol as RFC 765. This is
    completely different protocol for file transfer.<br /><br />And as for me, I believe,
    that FXP was feature authors carried in mind when creating that protocol, because
    fast links were too rare, so file copy server-client-server was a bad idea. Bad
    luck we can&#39;t ask Jon Postel. But Jon was one of the fathers of internet and
    I do believe, he was smart enough to see the need of server to server file copy.

  html: Oh my ... if only I would have waited for a day, then I could claim it was
    a joke  :-E<br /><br />You&#39;re absolutely correct. And with FXP being in the
    first incarnation of FTP, I agree with you it was there to support server-to-server
    copies. It was probably also easier to implement in those days than starting a
    telnet session to the host and doing FTP on the host.

  html: Damned, my comment disapeared in Null0 :-/<br /><br />But you are right that
    FTP has evolved from RFC 114 somehow. See RFC 430, 438 and discussions on server
    to server copy. <br /><br />But we must take care of history, I think that FTP
    we are talking about, can&#39;t be older than TCP/IP :)

    was a synonym of end-to-end connectivity and I hope someday it will be again.

  html: 'Climbing the steps to my ivory tower ... just a moment ... only a few steps
    left ... oh, this is getting harder every year ... OK, here I am: NAT does not
    break the end-to-end connectivity, the sessions are still established directly
    between the client and the server, it just destroys unique end-to-end addressing  8-)
    PAT interferes with port numbers, but the sessions are still end-to-end.<br /><br
    />Jumping through the ivory-framed window ... falling ... OUCH, reality hurts.
    <br /><br />I absolutely agree with you, NAT was a bad idea. It&#39;s yet another
    proof how quick hacks can proliferate when people refuse to consider the long-term
    view ... which brings us back to the IP addresses embedded in application data
    stream (you see, I&#39;ve learned how to use the proper engineering words).  :-P'

  html: 'NAT is a partial end-to-end. Ex: connection between 192.168.1.2 in company
    A and 192.168.1.2 in company B is a bit problem. You have to have 1:1 mapping
    between private and public addresses. So, that way of using NAT is also academic,
    because it doesn&#39;t solve IP depletion.<br /><br />But embeding L3 address
    in L7 from today&#39;s point of view causes problems when you switch from IPv4
    to IPv6. Nowadays I would use TLV representation of address to easily switch between
    different kinds of network addressing :) (as I don&#39;t see any other chance
    to do server-to-server copy)'
