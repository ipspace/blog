  html: "Strange the release notes still say:<br /><br />Advisories for Windows 7\
    \ and Vista Users<br /><br />Unsupported Features<br /><br />The Cisco VPN Client\
    \ for Windows 7 and Vista does not support the following features:<br />....<br\
    \ />\u202264-bit support<br /><br />For x-64 support, customers should explore\
    \ with their Cisco sales representative the use of the next-generation Cisco AnyConnect\
    \ VPN Client."

  html: Sort of brilliant.  After all, it&#39;s still just potential and not real.  Anyone
    have any information about the timeline for an actual public release, or how to
    get a hold of the beta client (for non-official testing)?
