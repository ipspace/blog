            <p class="comment-content">Welcome to the Internet ;) I have nothing to do with that remark. Just because I&#39;m linking to the web site where I&#39;ve found the information about the video does not mean I&#39;m endorsing everything that&#39;s written there.</p>

            <p class="comment-content">1. I like Juniper.  I like Cisco too, but JUNOS has some great things going for it.<br /><br />2. Too bad the &quot;design by pragmatism&quot; is not accepted more elsewhere.  Many technology companies think its possible to know every variable and and all costs to the penny before you even get to the purchasing phase.  All possible issues and all costs forever and on-going should be known quantities.  Of course, thats non-sense and it leads to endless meetings and a great deal of political hoopla to get meaningful work done. Its all about balance of course.  Theres risk, but theres also also work to be done and a ticking clock on the wall.<br /><br />I frequently say at work.. &quot;We&#39;ll cross that bridge when its on fire.&quot;  It scares some people, but hey... none of us are psychic.</p>
