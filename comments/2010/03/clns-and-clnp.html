            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan, thanks for answering my question. :-)<br />Kindly address me in full name, cuz my first name should be Chin Hoong instead, Yap is the surname. :-)<br />I am still in the midst of studying the theory of IS-IS (yes it is obsolete in CCNP syllabus but I studying for my own good), I haven&#39;t spend many times in labbing IS-IS stuffs, I believe I will have better visualization when I capture the packets upon the &quot;ping clns&quot; command. :-)<br /><br />thanks and have a nice day... expect more questions from me in the future. 8-)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Oh, my ... I apologize for the blunder. I&#39;m used to the surname being last; another one of those culture-specific things that I&#39;m totally unaware of. Thank you!<br /><br />When you do a capture on a LAN segment between two routers, you should see ES-IS packets (routers advertising themselves to non-existent hosts), IS-IS packets (obvious) as well as CLNP packets (when you do ping).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hey Guys,<br /><br />I was wondering if you could help me...<br />I&#39;ve been studying IS-IS because I&#39;ll be participating in a intense course in the mid August and I&#39;m trying to be a bit proactive.<br /><br />Anyways...<br /><br />I&#39;m really trying to figure out CLNS&#39;s role with IS-IS and it seems like this topic is ambiguous and no one can give me a straight answer.<br /><br />I&#39;ve read a book that says &quot;OSI suite is also referred to as the CLNS suite&quot;, that &quot;CLNS + CLNP = IP (in the TCP/IP stack)..<br /><br />You wrote: &quot;In my diagram, CLNS would be a thin line above CLNP between L3 and L4 boxes.&quot;<br /><br />However, this site shows: http://www.cellsoft.de/telecom/dcn.htm <br />that it&#39;s a thin line between layer 2 and 3.<br /><br />I need some help and if you guys could reply, that would be fantastic..<br /><br /><br /></div>
