            <div class="comment-content">nice results.. but quick question based on human nature and certainly not taking anything away from your skill :-).. but I always wondered...<br /><br />Once in a course or similar and you get to know someone it becomes v difficult to give bad results, in particular, if it is life effecting in some way such as bonuses or future work etc. In fact one can argue that you should get high results just for high effort  with integrity.<br /><br />I know in ciscoland for bingos, once i realised bonuses were based on them I was always going to give 5s if possible for any competent+ work,  despite my anti communism feelings.<br /><br />maybe its just me?</div>
