  html: I found it was expensive. I might have registered if I made the early registration
    discounted rate.

  html: I looked at the link because I&#39;m interested in service provider technologies,
    but as I&#39;m currently working in the mid-sized commercial market it wasn&#39;t
    something I wanted to pay for.

  html: 'Me: &quot;Would you pay me some money for some training on internet?&quot;<br
    />Manager: &quot;Ooh, that is tough, we don&#39;t have any training budget, except
    the one payed by customer direct. What kind of technology it is?&quot;<br />Me:
    &quot;General, about the stuff we do in networking&quot;<br />Manager: &quot;What
    do you mean by &quot;General&quot;. You mean its not about technology?&quot;<br
    />Me: &quot;Yes....err.....not really...it is generally about our SP network and
    the way to future, presented by one guy who EVEN wrote a book (trying to impress
    my manager) &quot;<br />Manager: &quot;Ah, well we don&#39;t have budget for that,
    but please send an email to nw_architects@company.com&quot;, they would certainly
    attend these.<br /><br />So, I am too low (according to my manager) to attend
    these. Now, I am 100% confident the TSAs did not attend as THEY HAVE NO INTEREST,
    from what I can tell (no offence) the TSA job is more about customer communication
    then figuring out why we don&#39;t use ATM any more........<br /><br />Therefore
    I suggest two alternatives:<br />- make the webminars low-cost, so that I can
    tell my wife I will spend a value compared to cinema ticket myself and go for
    it ..... not sure about what the wife would do in the meantime.....<br />- promote
    the webminars by making them well known to management - with this slogan &quot;DO
    YOU FEEL NOBODY SEES THE FOREST BECAUSE OF ALL THE TREES?&quot;'

  html: Too expensive unfortunately - being a one man band consultancy in todays financial
    climate - just couldnt justify it sadly.<br /><br />First reaction, is that if
    you are getting high visibility, but poor final take-up, the offering price-point
    is above the market expectation. (and the market is always right :-) )<br /><br
    />The real question for you - is the sweet point price, that cost such that you
    maximise attendance with maximum associated profit.<br /><br />Ie if you halved
    the cost, perhaps you would have more than doubled the attendance - leading to
    overall profit increase. In addition, once people have attended and bought into
    the events, you have a commited customer for life.<br /><br />Why not set up a
    poll - asking readers what they think the right price should be ?<br /><br />Good
    luck in future events ! 8-)

  html: If i could expense the seminar probably i would just go for it, but budget
    is tight and certainly this is quite out of my reach. Probably you can sell the
    recording of the seminar for the price of a movie ticket (or two) and profit from
    that. Sadly times when IT budgets were fat and generous are gone ...

  html: Well, our experience has shown that the key factor for a webinar being popular
    is making it free :) Any fee, be it 1$ or 49,95$ is the main stopping factor for
    general-type presentations. Unless people can associate some monetary value to
    the presentation (e.g. it&#39;s direct training for an exam) they psychologically
    aren&#39;t willing to spend a dime.

  html: I would pay $50, which is still steep (expensive) coming from a country where
    exchange rate favors the dollar.<br />Thats R 450.00 in South African currency.
    Also is there any material I can keep for future reference ?<br />slide show or
    word doc ?

  html: '&quot;The presentation is ideal for Service Provider account teams and sales
    engineers that have to understand the big picture...&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;m
    not sure that sales and account teams are the primary audience for a technical
    cisco blog like this.<br />I come for the configuration and stay for the witty
    comments. My take could be wrong though, so maybe you could post a poll &quot;what
    is your role within the company&quot; ranging from casual IT guy to network architecture,
    along side with the softer sales/account team and managerial roles to reach better
    conclusions about the audience clicking the link.<br /><br />I would gladly pay
    to attend a technical course where the content was of deep technical nature, but
    keep in mind that the technical deep dives are usually presented &quot;free&quot;
    by the vendor trying to sell you the technology in the form of lunch and learn
    sessions or sales sessions.<br /><br />For example, most topical books I have
    read (latest being &quot;interconnecting datacenters with VPLS&quot;) rarely have
    information that wasnt presented in greater detail by vendor engineers years prior
    on a road map, and again when it was generally available, and again when it reached
    large-scale deployment and validation, etc. They might be good introductions but
    if you are actually doing it working with a vendor they rarely bring any new exciting
    approaches as the vendor would have heard them from another customer already and
    suggested them.'

  html: Thank you for your comments. Agree with most of it (so I have to find a way
    around all these limitations  ;) ).
