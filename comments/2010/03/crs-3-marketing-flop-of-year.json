Google is talking about gigabit to the home and it gets mentioned on every news outlet in America, hell a town even renamed it self to Google for a month trying to stand out and get noticed so they could get in on the deal. If you say &quot;Here is a router&quot; in all honesty not many people will care. If you say &quot;Here is an amazing speed connection (That might be cause we have good routers)&quot; it would appear people do care.... alot<br /><br />So do people in your office care about having new good powerful routers?? If not lets try replacing them with all 2600s: if no one cares no one will complain",
