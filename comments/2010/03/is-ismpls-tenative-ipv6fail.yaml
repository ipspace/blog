  html: 6PE != VRF. That&#39;s 6VPE. Whether management over IPv6 works in 6PE environment
    is another issue (GRE tunnels over IPv6 don&#39;t).

  html: yes, for 6PE ipv6-based management (syslog/snmp) was ok (not tested in last
    two years)!<br />but for 6VPE it is still impossible. btw AAA is the next challenge...

  html: Anyhow, I would try to keep as much management as possible on IPv4. Easier
    with fewer bugs and compatibility problems.
