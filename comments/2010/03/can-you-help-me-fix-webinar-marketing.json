What kind of technology it is?&quot;<br />Me: &quot;General, about the stuff we do in networking&quot;<br />Manager: &quot;What do you mean by &quot;General&quot;. You mean its not about technology?&quot;<br />Me: &quot;Yes....err.....not really...it is generally about our SP network and the way to future, presented by one guy who EVEN wrote a book (trying to impress my manager) &quot;<br />Manager: &quot;Ah, well we don&#39;t have budget for that, but please send an email to nw_architects@company.com&quot;, they would certainly attend these.<br /><br />So, I am too low (according to my manager) to attend these. Now, I am 100% confident the TSAs did not attend as THEY HAVE NO INTEREST, from what I can tell (no offence) the TSA job is more about customer communication then figuring out why we don&#39;t use ATM any more........<br /><br />Therefore I suggest two alternatives:<br />- make the webminars low-cost, so that I can tell my wife I will spend a value compared to cinema ticket myself and go for it ..... not sure about what the wife would do in the meantime.....<br />- promote the webminars by making them well known to management - with this slogan &quot;DO YOU FEEL NOBODY SEES THE FOREST BECAUSE OF ALL THE TREES?&quot;",

      "html": "Too expensive unfortunately - being a one man band consultancy in todays financial climate - just couldnt justify it sadly.<br /><br />First reaction, is that if you are getting high visibility, but poor final take-up, the offering price-point is above the market expectation. (and the market is always right :-) )<br /><br />The real question for you - is the sweet point price, that cost such that you maximise attendance with maximum associated profit.<br /><br />Ie if you halved the cost, perhaps you would have more than doubled the attendance - leading to overall profit increase. In addition, once people have attended and bought into the events, you have a commited customer for life.<br /><br />Why not set up a poll - asking readers what they think the right price should be ?<br /><br />Good luck in future events ! 8-)",

      "html": "&quot;The presentation is ideal for Service Provider account teams and sales engineers that have to understand the big picture...&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure that sales and account teams are the primary audience for a technical cisco blog like this.<br />I come for the configuration and stay for the witty comments. My take could be wrong though, so maybe you could post a poll &quot;what is your role within the company&quot; ranging from casual IT guy to network architecture, along side with the softer sales/account team and managerial roles to reach better conclusions about the audience clicking the link.<br /><br />I would gladly pay to attend a technical course where the content was of deep technical nature, but keep in mind that the technical deep dives are usually presented &quot;free&quot; by the vendor trying to sell you the technology in the form of lunch and learn sessions or sales sessions.<br /><br />For example, most topical books I have read (latest being &quot;interconnecting datacenters with VPLS&quot;) rarely have information that wasnt presented in greater detail by vendor engineers years prior on a road map, and again when it was generally available, and again when it reached large-scale deployment and validation, etc. They might be good introductions but if you are actually doing it working with a vendor they rarely bring any new exciting approaches as the vendor would have heard them from another customer already and suggested them.",
