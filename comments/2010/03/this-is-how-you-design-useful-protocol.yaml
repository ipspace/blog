  html: Welcome to the Internet ;) I have nothing to do with that remark. Just because
    I&#39;m linking to the web site where I&#39;ve found the information about the
    video does not mean I&#39;m endorsing everything that&#39;s written there.

  html: 1. I like Juniper.  I like Cisco too, but JUNOS has some great things going
    for it.<br /><br />2. Too bad the &quot;design by pragmatism&quot; is not accepted
    more elsewhere.  Many technology companies think its possible to know every variable
    and and all costs to the penny before you even get to the purchasing phase.  All
    possible issues and all costs forever and on-going should be known quantities.  Of
    course, thats non-sense and it leads to endless meetings and a great deal of political
    hoopla to get meaningful work done. Its all about balance of course.  Theres risk,
    but theres also also work to be done and a ticking clock on the wall.<br /><br
    />I frequently say at work.. &quot;We&#39;ll cross that bridge when its on fire.&quot;  It
    scares some people, but hey... none of us are psychic.
