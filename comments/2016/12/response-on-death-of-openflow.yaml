  html: 'When I first got back to the US in 2011, I was confronted by the SDN division
    of responsibilities in the network being all the rage in the academic research
    community, that by separating networking into a control plane and a data plane
    &quot;SOLVED GREAT THINGS!&quot;. I was non-plussed. &quot;Great. Now you have
    two wires. That helps, how?&quot;<br /><br />A steaming pile of research dollars
    was out there chasing the concept.<br /><br />Cynically I put it down to finding
    a way to get a generation of grad students to write provably correct conf files,
    or that more likely everyone had lost the ability to program at a low enough level
    (hardware and software), to be able to make a difference at the dataplane. The
    algorithms we&#39;ve developed in the #bufferbloat project - all seemingly impossible
    to fund in this environment - apply at the dataplane - and are actually useful
    and deployable, today, and I can see pouring them directly into hardware, soon.
    I am glad to have mostly ignored the whole SDN thing.'

    html: Bela - BGP-FS si available in every major vendor&#39;s BGP stack as well
      as in ODL BGP stack and soon to be on ONOS, not sure about details there though.
      The focus of PCEP has always been - path provisioning, not FEC bindings, however
      there are some additions, being co-author of all the relevant drafts I can provide
      more info, if of interest.<br /><br />Wrt configuration - PBR is an ephemeral
      state that could be perfectly provisioned using any existing or new configuration
      protoocol - Netconf/Restconf/gRPC, etc

    html: 'OF, while could work quite well when used properly - policy configuration
      (ACL&#39;s, PBR, etc), and this is how it is being used in most products that
      run in production. When it is used to configure per flow forwarding it hits
      all the limitations, as described above by Ivan, and more and is absolutely
      of no use.. not every problem needs a hammer ;-) '

  html: Hybrid SDN would make sense. And yes, this dynamic ACL/PBR. <br />This is
    not tied to OpenFlow, though. BGP FlowSpec is not widely implemented yet. PCEP
    is too specific to MPLS. <br />So sometimes only OpenFlow is available. <br />But
    implementations are poor and there is no progress. Specifications are coming out,
    but noone is taking care. Certification is impractical. The ONF is under restructuring,
    because it is actually dead now...<br /><br />The biggest problem with alternative
    PBR solutions, that you could also need efficient triggering and redirecting traffic
    to the controller. This is provided by OpenFlow, but not by BGP FlowSpec. So they
    are not fully replacing each other...<br />
