    html: Hi Marc,<br /><br />How about starting with &quot;I&#39;m VP of Marketing
      @ Noviflow using a third-party blog to promote my products&quot; ;) Also, I
      did mention &quot;exceptions using NPU&quot;, which is what NoviFlow is doing.

      products. So there! And thanks, Ivan, for generating this opportunity for me
      to do so!

  html: Hello Ivan,<br /><br />As you&#39;ve remarked in one of your webinars, NoviFlow&#39;s
    NoviSwitches are the exception to the rule in having implemented the full openFlow
    1.3 spec (and most of 1.4 and even parts of 1.5), at high capacity (up to 512
    Gbps), at line rate even for 100 Gbps ports. We have also implemented a series
    of OpenFlow Experimenter extensions to provide many features not covered by the
    OpenFlow specifications to provide L2-L7 packet header AND payload matching and
    flow handling, BFD link monitoring , L2 and L3 VLAN support for GRE, VxLAN, MPLS
    and GTP, and built-in hashing and symmetric hash-of-fields, and then finally a
    whole slew of OAM oriented features such as TACACS+, RADIUS authentication, SNMP,
    full CLI, and even gRPC automated provisioning for large installations. Anyone
    interested in high-performance fully programmable SDN forwarding planes are invited
    to our website and check our our product specs to verify the above.

    html: 'Disclaimer: I&#39;m VP of Marketing @ NoviFlow a company that makes and
      sells fully-programmable, high-performance OpenFlow switches and solutions based
      on NPUs - the execution that Ivan mentions above. I have been involved in many
      new technologies during my career, and your perception of OpenFlow being dead
      is typical at this stage in the overall uptake cycle of any new technology (see
      Gartner&#39;s Hype Curves), so I understand what you&#39;re saying, but I don&#39;t
      agree your conclusion. As a vendor, in the last eighteen months we&#39;ve seen
      a massive uptake OpenFlow based solutions being deployed around the world. Some
      of these, as with Telstra&#39;s PEN network, are public. I am also involved
      with the ON.Lab merger with the ONF - further disclaimer: I am the Director
      of the Market Area of the ONF. The reason we are doing this merger is to bring
      the specification development process closer to the Open Source projects which
      are driving the evolution of the specs as well as uptake of the specifications
      by users. Our intent is to leverage this model to accelerate both in a virtuous
      circle of design as a reaction to real-world user needs. As to your claim f
      no serious disruptive device vendor, here is  a &quot;market disruptor&quot;
      report from Current Analysis about NoviFlow: http://noviflow.com/wp-content/uploads/Report_99245.pdf '

    html: Dear Marc,<br /><br />NoviFlow is too small currently to make a real influence
      on the market. This may change in the future... :-)<br />Let&#39;s see... :-)<br

    html: We also need some interoperability certifications. Current vendor statements
      are not good enough for network design. ONF is lagging behind in certifications
      and that makes life pretty difficult.<br />Only the Chinese vendors take somewhat
      serious ONF certifications, but even that does not help much...<br />

  html: OpenFlow is practically dead. Maybe it will be revived after the ON.Lab merger...
    There is no serious disruptive device vendor.

      else: we covered one of the programmable pipelines (not sure whether it&#39;s
      the same one Diego mentioned) in this podcast:<br /><br />http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/06/software-defined-hardware-forwarding.html'

  html: 'Disclaimer: I&#39;m (among other things) an R&amp;D engineer for SW and ASICs
    @ HPE-Aruba, and I personally worked implementing OpenFlow in hardware. So, I&#39;m
    shamelessly promoting something I worked on.<br /><br />If the use case is more
    about flexibility than raw performance, the latest generation of ASICs in the
    HPE-Aruba Campus product line (for Datacenter, as Ivan said, you may need to wait
    for some new ASICs coming out soon) has the ability of offer re-programable OF
    pipelines and a wide range of matches and transformations, using dedicated TCAMs
    and Hashes. Your performance millage may vary depending on your table and rule
    set.<br /><br />The &quot;HPE Switch Software OpenFlow v1.3 Administrator Guide&quot;
    has a section about &quot;OpenFlow Custom pipeline&quot; that provides all the
    technical details and constraints, so you can jump straight into the details and
    skip the marketing.<br /><br />Diego'
