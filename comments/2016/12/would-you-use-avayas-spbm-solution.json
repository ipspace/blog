          "html": "I like the concept of using unnumbered interfaces.  That takes a lot of admin overhead out of the system.  Also, I&#39;m comfortable with using BGP/MPLS/VRF.  I really want our &quot;legacy&quot; technologies to work because they have been proven stable for 10+ years.<br /><br />But we still have a couple problems with a traditional IP core.<br /><br />1. The IP/LDP/MPLS/BGP/VRF/OSPF stack is a lot of moving pieces.  I may be comfortable with each of these protocols, but I&#39;m *not* comfortable with how *many* protocols I need to get the job done.  Also, I&#39;ve been doing this for fifteen years.  A more junior person is going to have difficulty.<br />2. I&#39;m not going to get BGP/MPLS/VRF in anything but the top-end datacenter gear.  That costs a lot of money.  Ugh.<br /><br />I guess if you are building a datacenter, you might be in the price-range for the proper gear to do BGP/MPLS/VRF.  But I build a lot of enterprise networks too.  I have user-facing closet switches and enterprise core.  For Cisco people, we&#39;re talking Catalyst 4500, 3850 and 3650.  For HPE, we&#39;re talking the 5400R.<br /><br />I have many of the same needs as a datacenter.<br /><br />1. I want ECMP.  I don&#39;t want to shut off all links but one (STP).  <br />2. I&#39;d like multitenancy.  Example: My guest wireless shouldn&#39;t interact with my other traffic.  <br />3. I might want a VLAN to span across multiple different areas of a campus.  Example: I have a campus with five buildings, and each of them needs a VLAN (security partition) for the HVAC controls.  Should that be one VLAN or five?  Logically, it&#39;s only one application with one security profile.  But I don&#39;t want STP to span across the entire campus.<br /><br />It seems an SPB or TRILL type of technology would solve my problems.  If I could get one of these into the type of gear I use for enterprise builds I could get rid of STP forever!! <br />",

All unnecessary complexity just makes the whole system hard to configure &amp; maintain, and less reliable (more pieces =&gt; more bugs, more possibilities to fail).<br /><br />Thus we went for much simpler &amp; straightforward approach and built national academic network using TRILL. It&#39;s not new encapsulation, all BCM ASICs support it for several years already - just the vendors haven&#39;t enabled it in software. And of course, all programable ASICs can support it as well.<br /><br />Experience? TRILL took all the good things from routed IP world and implemented it into layer2. You configure it in a few minutes, and can forget about it - because it just works. <br /><br />For an enterprise network, I wouldn&#39;t even start thinking about MPLS or VXLAN anymore. But obviously, solutions like TRILL don&#39;t get much attention from vendors, since complex technologies could be sold for more money and you&#39;ll probably also need to buy some expert services just to get them working. But we, end-users, need to push for solutions we need, instead of blindly buying complex solutions just because they are loudly marketed.<br />",

      "html": "Something confuses me about the debate between VXLAN and other overlay technologies. VXLAN is typically initiated by hosts on the network, e.g., ESXi or HyperV.  It is an *overylay* network.  It creates a Layer-2 segment that sits on top of the underlay network.  Great.  That gives us a huge amount of flexibility.  Millions of networks could be created/removed as services are created/removed.  It can support micro-segmentation, ephemeral networks and multi-tenancy.  Those services could be VMs, containers, whatever.  <br /><br />That&#39;s fantastic and completely eliminates any limitations in the underlay network.  Also, it&#39;s controlled by the end-host, so VMWare and Microsoft are free to innovate as quickly as they like without waiting for the underlay architecture to catch up.<br /><br />But what technology do we build the underlay with?  <br /><br />1. A routed IP network is a mature technology and works great except there are a number of limitations:<br />1a. There is (possibly) a lot of manual configuration.  Do we use a truck load of /30 networks all over the place?<br />1b. There is no built-in support for multi-tenancy (for the underlay) unless we deploy VRF, MPLS, RFC2547, etc.  Those features are not available unless you start buying much more expensive gear.<br /><br />2. You can use regular VLANs with Spanning Tree.  It&#39;s 2016.  STP stinks.  We all want out of that dungeon.<br /><br />3. SDN is an option where I continue to have doubts.  My old network with standard routing protocols was distributed; failures were localized.  If I have a pair of controllers working to orchestrate everything than I have a centralized system with a single point of failure.  <br /><br />4. We have SPB and TRILL.  They support millions of segments.  They support multi-tenancy.  They support ECMP.  We have chipsets in inexpensive gear that can move these types of Ethernet frames at line rate.<br /><br />I agree that vendor lock-in should be a consideration.  I agree there are not very many engineers that know SPB and TRILL.  But I also know the IT field is staffed by capable people that can accommodate change in technology better than any other segment of the population!<br /><br />Can&#39;t I ask for a world where VXLAN sits on top of something sane?",

But there are serious design issues that are now inappropriate for modern networks.<br /><br />For instance: there twelve bytes of address information in the header.  That&#39;s 2^96 addresses.  But if we have a PTP routed link to the next switch, don\u2019t we need only two addresses?  How about no addresses; it will arrive at the other side and we don&#39;t need addresses.  Talk about bloat.  Let the upper layer do the addressing (it already does!)<br />",

The biggest argument for not using Avaya, might be that one is reluctant to learn the tech behind it.<br />As far as being forced to use Avaya end to end, that&#39;s simply not true. You can certainly mix the Avaya fabric with a traditional network.<br />You can use 2 cheap Avaya VSP 4000s to create an overlay network , connect cisco switches at either end, do a &quot;show cdp neighbor&quot; and the Cisco switches would think they are on the same LAN. And thats just one use case..<br /><br />If you plan to do any multicast on your network, then there&#39;s no discussion to be had. Avaya is flat out better.<br />I make an argument for Avaya SPBM over cisco here...I&#39;ve had a CCIE for over 15 years.<br />http://www.bluesodium.com/blog/8-reasons-to-choose-avaya-instead-of-cisco-for-your-data-network/",

I can understand Ivan is trying to be vendor neutral. <br /><br />However, the typical networking equipment life cycle is about 5 years and many of Medium sized businesses prefer single vendor during the life time of the network, larger business likely have two-vendor policy. Lock-in, maybe, for longtime, no way. <br /><br />According to Avaya SPB deployments reached 1200+ mark. I would say it is not longer an untested solution.<br /><br />In reality, VXLAN and EVPN are designed for Data Centers not campus networks.<br /><br />If there is a solution that is easy to deploy, easy to operate, automated service creation, you can enjoy it for 5 years, great. If anything better available after 5 years, go for it.<br /><br />",
