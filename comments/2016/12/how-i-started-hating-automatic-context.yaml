    html: if you are still thinking about box level commit check, it is time to change
      :)     it doesn&#39;t matter if network OS is still cmd by cmd, what you need
      is a network wide &quot;show|compare&quot; and &quot;commit|check&quot;, it
      doesn&#39;t mater if underneath is IOS or Cumulus or JUNos, EOS ....

    html: Hi Eric! I totally understand you love what your company is doing, but in
      essence it&#39;s just replacing the point of lock-in. See also http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/01/lock-in-is-inevitable-get-used-to-it.html

  html: 'Yeah they made a bunch of legacy support decisions with XR when they should
    have just thrown it all out.  Automatic context switching, ambiguous &quot;no&quot;
    statements to delete config.   Not being able to define empty prefix-lists is
    another peeve of mine.  '

  html: Speaking about &quot;automatic context switching&quot;, did it ever happen
    to you to try to apply a route-policy to a peer, but forget to mention in or out
    ? If so, have you realised what happened before or after &quot;commit&quot; ?
    :) IOS-XR case....
