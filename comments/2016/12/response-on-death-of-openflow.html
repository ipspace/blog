            <div class="comment-content">When I first got back to the US in 2011, I was confronted by the SDN division of responsibilities in the network being all the rage in the academic research community, that by separating networking into a control plane and a data plane &quot;SOLVED GREAT THINGS!&quot;. I was non-plussed. &quot;Great. Now you have two wires. That helps, how?&quot;<br /><br />A steaming pile of research dollars was out there chasing the concept.<br /><br />Cynically I put it down to finding a way to get a generation of grad students to write provably correct conf files, or that more likely everyone had lost the ability to program at a low enough level (hardware and software), to be able to make a difference at the dataplane. The algorithms we&#39;ve developed in the #bufferbloat project - all seemingly impossible to fund in this environment - apply at the dataplane - and are actually useful and deployable, today, and I can see pouring them directly into hardware, soon. I am glad to have mostly ignored the whole SDN thing.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hybrid SDN would make sense. And yes, this dynamic ACL/PBR. <br />This is not tied to OpenFlow, though. BGP FlowSpec is not widely implemented yet. PCEP is too specific to MPLS. <br />So sometimes only OpenFlow is available. <br />But implementations are poor and there is no progress. Specifications are coming out, but noone is taking care. Certification is impractical. The ONF is under restructuring, because it is actually dead now...<br /><br />The biggest problem with alternative PBR solutions, that you could also need efficient triggering and redirecting traffic to the controller. This is provided by OpenFlow, but not by BGP FlowSpec. So they are not fully replacing each other...<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">Bela - BGP-FS si available in every major vendor&#39;s BGP stack as well as in ODL BGP stack and soon to be on ONOS, not sure about details there though. The focus of PCEP has always been - path provisioning, not FEC bindings, however there are some additions, being co-author of all the relevant drafts I can provide more info, if of interest.<br /><br />Wrt configuration - PBR is an ephemeral state that could be perfectly provisioned using any existing or new configuration protoocol - Netconf/Restconf/gRPC, etc</div>

            <div class="comment-content">OF, while could work quite well when used properly - policy configuration (ACL&#39;s, PBR, etc), and this is how it is being used in most products that run in production. When it is used to configure per flow forwarding it hits all the limitations, as described above by Ivan, and more and is absolutely of no use.. not every problem needs a hammer ;-) </div>
