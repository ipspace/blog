            <div class="comment-content">Hello Ivan,<br /><br />As you&#39;ve remarked in one of your webinars, NoviFlow&#39;s NoviSwitches are the exception to the rule in having implemented the full openFlow 1.3 spec (and most of 1.4 and even parts of 1.5), at high capacity (up to 512 Gbps), at line rate even for 100 Gbps ports. We have also implemented a series of OpenFlow Experimenter extensions to provide many features not covered by the OpenFlow specifications to provide L2-L7 packet header AND payload matching and flow handling, BFD link monitoring , L2 and L3 VLAN support for GRE, VxLAN, MPLS and GTP, and built-in hashing and symmetric hash-of-fields, and then finally a whole slew of OAM oriented features such as TACACS+, RADIUS authentication, SNMP, full CLI, and even gRPC automated provisioning for large installations. Anyone interested in high-performance fully programmable SDN forwarding planes are invited to our website and check our our product specs to verify the above.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Disclaimer: I&#39;m VP of Marketing @ NoviFlow a company that makes and sells fully-programmable, high-performance OpenFlow switches and solutions based on NPUs - the execution that Ivan mentions above. I have been involved in many new technologies during my career, and your perception of OpenFlow being dead is typical at this stage in the overall uptake cycle of any new technology (see Gartner&#39;s Hype Curves), so I understand what you&#39;re saying, but I don&#39;t agree your conclusion. As a vendor, in the last eighteen months we&#39;ve seen a massive uptake OpenFlow based solutions being deployed around the world. Some of these, as with Telstra&#39;s PEN network, are public. I am also involved with the ON.Lab merger with the ONF - further disclaimer: I am the Director of the Market Area of the ONF. The reason we are doing this merger is to bring the specification development process closer to the Open Source projects which are driving the evolution of the specs as well as uptake of the specifications by users. Our intent is to leverage this model to accelerate both in a virtuous circle of design as a reaction to real-world user needs. As to your claim f no serious disruptive device vendor, here is  a &quot;market disruptor&quot; report from Current Analysis about NoviFlow: http://noviflow.com/wp-content/uploads/Report_99245.pdf </div>

            <div class="comment-content">We also need some interoperability certifications. Current vendor statements are not good enough for network design. ONF is lagging behind in certifications and that makes life pretty difficult.<br />Only the Chinese vendors take somewhat serious ONF certifications, but even that does not help much...<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">Disclaimer: I&#39;m (among other things) an R&amp;D engineer for SW and ASICs @ HPE-Aruba, and I personally worked implementing OpenFlow in hardware. So, I&#39;m shamelessly promoting something I worked on.<br /><br />If the use case is more about flexibility than raw performance, the latest generation of ASICs in the HPE-Aruba Campus product line (for Datacenter, as Ivan said, you may need to wait for some new ASICs coming out soon) has the ability of offer re-programable OF pipelines and a wide range of matches and transformations, using dedicated TCAMs and Hashes. Your performance millage may vary depending on your table and rule set.<br /><br />The &quot;HPE Switch Software OpenFlow v1.3 Administrator Guide&quot; has a section about &quot;OpenFlow Custom pipeline&quot; that provides all the technical details and constraints, so you can jump straight into the details and skip the marketing.<br /><br />Diego</div>
