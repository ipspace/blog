            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;m not sure how VMware can say they own every space, they are missing the physical servers as well as the physical switches. Disclaimer: I work for Cisco. But you can&#39;t say they own networking because they can only work with vSphere, and they can&#39;t say they own compute... Whether it&#39;s UCS or something else. Networking doesn&#39;t live in the ether. I&#39;d love to hear Ivan&#39;s take on cross cloud. Openstack is a great technology, but it&#39;s a cloud orchestration tool. And VMware only works with its own distribution of openstack to my knowledge. Feel free to correct me if I&#39;m wrong. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">Thanks for your comment, AdaptingIT. VMware is a software company, yes, and as such we rely on the various hardware vendors for our solutions to work. The value here is customer choice. I believe we have the most complete and comprehensive hardware compatibility matrix in the market. Our compute (vSphere) works on virtually anyone&#39;s servers and our networking (NSX) works on any physical network, including non-traditional vendors favored in OpenStack clouds due to cost, for example. We strongly believe in this decoupling from hardware, and that the datacenter needs to be software-defined (as it is the name of this podcast series). With that said, we have also validated our solutions on top of the leading converged and hyper-converged architectures when customers look for turnkey solutions. Let me also provide some corrections: 1) NSX has a multi-hypervisor edition that supports KVM. 2) While it is true that VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO) only works with VMware technologies (vSphere and NSX), any other OpenStack distribution (or DIY OpenStack) can leverage the upstreamed vSphere and NSX plugins for Nova, Neutron, Glance and Cinder. We have several customers who procured their OpenStack from someone else, while running it on top of VMware. If you listen to the podcast, I discuss these options around the 15 min mark. Thanks.</div>
