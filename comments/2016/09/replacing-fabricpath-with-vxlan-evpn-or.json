      "html": "There are more options to choose an automated fabric along with EVPN like Dell OS9 or Cisco NFM. More mature products than EVPN are NSX, Contrail, Nuage. This is a similar discussions we had together several years ago. Which was more mature VPLS or a new OTV which had in-built timer before a convergence starts? At that time it occurred that VPLS was better, converged faster. After 2-3 additional years OTV was better. At least for enterprise class Data Centers. The same case is with EVPN with the exception that NSX, Contrail and Nuage are still developed and providing more features than EVPN. Of course there are pros and cons as always. Depending on the business and technical requirements.",

      "html": "I keep thinking that VXLAN + BGP EVPN + HSRP Anycast combo, all of which tend to go together, are too complex for a typical enterprise to configure and maintain. For small and medium sized &quot;cloud&quot; providers may be good fit, as they can automate, and reduce some of the configuration complexity. Having worked with both NSX and ACI, and other similar products (e.g. Mirantis for OpenStack), I think they are a better fit for typical enterprise customer, that may be running 2000 or less VMs, as they hide much of the complexity. I feel that&#39;s a necessity for smaller shops that only have 5-10 people handling all of the data center infrastructure. It&#39;s like using any version of Windows, without necessarily needing to know about every single registry entry.",

You could use EVPN control plane or configure VXLAN head-end replication on the leaf switches.&quot;  EVPN control plane doesn&#39;t negate the need for multicast or head end replication, but your statement seems to read like that.  EVPN still requires ingress replication or multicast to deal with (thankfully now limited) BUM traffic.  EVPN just handles learning so there is much less BUM.
