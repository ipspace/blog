      "html": "I was thinking about something similar just recently, and a weird idea came to mind - why not run RIP between the VM and the TOR?<br /><br />I know, I know, and before you laugh and spurt coffee out your nose at the thought of such an old crusty IGP in a DC maybe think about it for a minute.<br /><br />RIPv2 supports easy summarization and route filtering for the TOR. With reduced timers (and maybe BFD) convergence could come down to a second or three. ECMP works too. Oh, and it has very few nerd-knobs for the server guys to play with.<br /><br />It just seems like a much simpler solution than BGP into the hypervisors &amp; VMs.<br />",

The route servers (reflectors) make good sense, but I&#39;d have thought peering with a daemon on the hypervisor and that reflecting it up (in the case of iBGP) would be a better solution? You can have the same IP as a loopback on every hypervisor and not worry.",
