            <div class="comment-content">I think the majority of enterprises should start with &quot;everything in area 0&quot; unless:<br />1 - Summarisation in order to make the route tables slightly more human friendly.<br />2 - Reduced failure domain.  Want to exchange routes with a firewall?  Have lots of WAN links where you expect a fair amount of churn?  Here&#39;s an area (or two) for those.<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">Mobile backhaul is a good example of an multi-area topology - suppose you have a hub (with 2 routers) and 2-3K spokes (cell sites and link going to each hub router, ie. 2 uplinks per cell site). In this scenario cell router is quite simple piece of hardware with basic OSPF NSSA support. The link between hub routers used as intra-area connection (i.e. 2-3k vlans per hub-spoke topology). Hub routers advertise summarized route to the backbone, operator have flexibility to have ECMP or active/standby configuration on a per-cell site basis. With modern routing hardware on a hub side you can enable various additional features such as non-stop routing... </div>
