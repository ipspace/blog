  html: Totally agree, and all of those are reasons why we&#39;ve moved from OSPF
    on servers...but not to BGP. RIP isn&#39;t RIP yet ! <br /><br />RIP itself is
    simple (important for server admins), summarisation is simple, route filtering
    is simple, convergence speed is even better than BGP because we don&#39;t announce
    a lot of prefixes, and trust boundary is here, you can use BFD if you want, you
    can use it in unicast mode, VM mobility between l2 networks is doable, etc etc.
    <br /><br />What&#39;s not to like ?<br /><br />

    html: Jen Rexford&#39;s students worked on that IIRC. The idea was creative, but
      alas not too practical (well, academic :)). In production environments it&#39;s
      generally easier to do BGP route injection, given reasonably broad support in
      DC/WAN devices (which, btw Jen and Albert worked on at AT&amp;T a while ago)

  html: RFC7938 gives you pretty good ideas what can be done with BGP and would be
    extremely complicated to do with an IGP. If i recall correctly, Ivan did a podcast
    with some academia guy who hacked OSPF

  html: IBM mainframes have been using RIP and OSFP for HA purposes for a long time.

  html: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fang-mpls-hsdn-for-hsdc specifies a functional
    hierarchical BGP &amp; MPLS design for 10 million hypervisors (500K servers x
    20 datacenters). I&#39;ve never seen a link-state IGP tested beyond 64K routes
    (more than 2 orders of magnitude below the scale in the draft).<br /><br />If
    they really want the convergence benefits of a link-state IGP, they should look
    in to implementing BGP-LS/BGP-TE.<br /><br />-Blake
