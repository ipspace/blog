I don&#39;t think ospf had a good start either and that was with the IETF. Good open source projects will grow and mature if they get a sufficiently large community.<br /><br />One thing is certain though. Vendors will have a hard time protecting their interests with open source projects, although that won&#39;t stop them from trying.<br /><br />in my opinion both can cohexist. Anything that wins the mass adoption race deserves to be a standard. It&#39;s called de-facto standard.",

If there was a requirement on every standard, that is adopted, to be support by open-source reference implementation then it would really help encourage adoption and also avoid vendor lock in.<br />We see a lot of standards where there are only proprietary implementations and customers have no choice but to go to one of the big vendors to solve their problem.
