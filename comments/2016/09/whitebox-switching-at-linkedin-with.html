            <p class="comment-content">Interesting discussion, thanks for sharing Ivan!<br /><br />Things I would to take from this podcast are:<br />- Technology is more important than the feature-set<br />- You should own your architecture if you wanna control your future.<br />- When a vendor pushes your architecture, hence it pushes your business!<br />- Build something around your Business architecture.<br />- It&#39;s all about sharing and caring in the networking community!<br />- You should know why and how things work rather than how to configure them.<br />- We call it Software Defined, but it&#39;s actually running on ASICs :)</p>
