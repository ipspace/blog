    html: In most cases it comes down to &quot;how much does it cost&quot; or &quot;which
      vendor will throw in the licenses for free just to get the business&quot; ;)<br
      /><br />Also, in most enterprise environments Contrail or Nuage are a non-starter.

  html: There are more options to choose an automated fabric along with EVPN like
    Dell OS9 or Cisco NFM. More mature products than EVPN are NSX, Contrail, Nuage.
    This is a similar discussions we had together several years ago. Which was more
    mature VPLS or a new OTV which had in-built timer before a convergence starts?
    At that time it occurred that VPLS was better, converged faster. After 2-3 additional
    years OTV was better. At least for enterprise class Data Centers. The same case
    is with EVPN with the exception that NSX, Contrail and Nuage are still developed
    and providing more features than EVPN. Of course there are pros and cons as always.
    Depending on the business and technical requirements.

    html: Hi Salman,<br /><br />For 2000 VMs you need two switches with simple VLAN
      trunk between them. No need for FP, VXLAN, EVPN or ACI. In that environment
      VXLAN might only be useful for people who firmly believe in L2 DCI.

    html: Well - I am thinking of a typical enterprise, 70-75% virtualized, with rest
      physical workloads (Exchange, DBs, appliances, may be even Mainframe, or other
      Unix servers) - then you&#39;ll end up needing much more than two switches :)

  html: I keep thinking that VXLAN + BGP EVPN + HSRP Anycast combo, all of which tend
    to go together, are too complex for a typical enterprise to configure and maintain.
    For small and medium sized &quot;cloud&quot; providers may be good fit, as they
    can automate, and reduce some of the configuration complexity. Having worked with
    both NSX and ACI, and other similar products (e.g. Mirantis for OpenStack), I
    think they are a better fit for typical enterprise customer, that may be running
    2000 or less VMs, as they hide much of the complexity. I feel that&#39;s a necessity
    for smaller shops that only have 5-10 people handling all of the data center infrastructure.
    It&#39;s like using any version of Windows, without necessarily needing to know
    about every single registry entry.

    html: 25 years ago I&#39;ve heard Banyan Vines was huge in Australia ;))<br /><br
      />As for Brocade, let&#39;s see how many new features we&#39;ll see in VCS Fabric
      versus IP Fabric in the next 24 months. I&#39;m not saying L2 fabrics are dead
      today, I&#39;m just seeing where everyone is running.

    html: Well, TRILL has much more use cases than DC fabric.<br /><br />2 years ago
      we implemented internet exchange point using TRILL switches (http://www.six.sk)
      and as you can check in our looking glass, we still have several BGP sessions
      with 2 years uptime.<br /><br />This year we used TRILL for 100GE national research
      &amp; educational backbone (http://www.sanet.sk/en/siet_topologia.shtm) where
      40 TRILL switches cover the whole country.<br /><br />But yes, complexity sells
      better, thus simple, straightforward and cost-effective solutions don&#39;t
      get big attention from vendors...

  html: 'Although I agree with everything mentioned, I recently heard that in Asia
    L2 fabrics are huge. Huawei seems to have pushed TRILL further than anybody expected
    and are solving real problems. Maybe somebody in the know can further comment.
    Also, Brocade hasn&#39;t stopped developing their TRILL solution, their IP fabric
    and their VCS fabric just suit different needs - the main argument being scale
    (but it is true that the new SLX platform is pure IP fabric). '

    html: I&#39;m little bit confused I think VTS is not EoL. At the link above Cisco
      suggeted to customers to migrate to VTS 2.0 that is VxLAN based overlay with
      EVPN control plane.

  html: "Agree with everytying here.  One minor correction I think:  &quot;However,\
    \ you don\u2019t need IP multicast for VXLAN to work. You could use EVPN control\
    \ plane or configure VXLAN head-end replication on the leaf switches.&quot;  EVPN\
    \ control plane doesn&#39;t negate the need for multicast or head end replication,\
    \ but your statement seems to read like that.  EVPN still requires ingress replication\
    \ or multicast to deal with (thankfully now limited) BUM traffic.  EVPN just handles\
    \ learning so there is much less BUM.  BUM still exists, can&#39;t escape that."
