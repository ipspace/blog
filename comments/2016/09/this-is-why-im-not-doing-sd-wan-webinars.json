If a vendor is not ready to publish their documentation online in 2016, I&#39;m not willing to spend my time on researching them. <br /><br />Also, I always ask for technical documentation (configuration and design guides) and it&#39;s amazing how many times the vendors who contacted me on their own don&#39;t want to hear about that.",
