            <div class="comment-content">More expensive?  Really? £11k pa will get me 100mbps point to point Ethernet circuit these days, I remember 17 years ago having a 2mbps circuit costing somewhere in the region of £16-17k pa.<br /><br />Things used to be a LOT more expensive, I remember when we were looking at a pair of Cat6509s for the datacentre back in 2002, and it made my eyes water at the price.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">You can get a 10 gig point-to-point Ethernet wave that crosses the Atlantic ocean for less ~10k per month.  Yes, networking has gotten much cheaper.  Unfortunately, we still have to deal with the same clueless, network stupid executives who spend all their money on magic beans (i.e. cloud orchestration suites), but are the first to complain with the poor performance of their network.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">To be fair sfps are still expensive, but the main reason could be due to politics. In most orgs I have worked in, I&#39;ve never seen anyone in a senior leadership role with a networking backgound, unless it was someone who had a legacy voice background. Even in IT, most leadership comes from the dev, database or PM side. So there is no one in authority to refute or at least look skeptically at the claims. Networking now, is for sure cheaper than the days of ISDN, frame relay, ATM, Token Ring, FDDI, Packet over SONET.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">And when was the last time you deployed a VM in an enterprise environment? Someone mentioned &quot;time to deploy a VM&quot; as the biggest problem they&#39;re facing in their DC.<br /><br />Just because clouderati talk about pets and cattle doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s true in typical enterprises. Likewise I could give you examples of network devices being treated like cattle (for example, every cable modem  :D).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Good points. Have you considered the costs within a limited world view though? That is, if you included the entire world of costs, relative to productivity in the past, what would the actual status of your question be? For example there is no doubt that technology increases the productive power of an economy. And this increase is relative, all else being equal. So how much did a 64k link technology increase productivity in the 80&#39;s compared to a 10G one today? I dont have a scientifically priced answer. But I remember working on 64k multiplexors and the price improvement &#39;felt&#39; as good as a 10G today. The thing which I forecast is tipping the balance against your case is the need for more security the more Internet is used. And obviating the security leviathan with some kind of radical new technology, much as the Internet did at inception is surely the objective of the likes of you and I, rather than to relax and pretend &#39;everything is fine&#39;</div>
