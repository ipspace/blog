RIP isn&#39;t RIP yet ! <br /><br />RIP itself is simple (important for server admins), summarisation is simple, route filtering is simple, convergence speed is even better than BGP because we don&#39;t announce a lot of prefixes, and trust boundary is here, you can use BFD if you want, you can use it in unicast mode, VM mobility between l2 networks is doable, etc etc. <br /><br />What&#39;s not to like ?<br /><br />",

In production environments it&#39;s generally easier to do BGP route injection, given reasonably broad support in DC/WAN devices (which, btw Jen and Albert worked on at AT&amp;T a while ago)",
