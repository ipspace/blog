In most orgs I have worked in, I&#39;ve never seen anyone in a senior leadership role with a networking backgound, unless it was someone who had a legacy voice background. Even in IT, most leadership comes from the dev, database or PM side. So there is no one in authority to refute or at least look skeptically at the claims. Networking now, is for sure cheaper than the days of ISDN, frame relay, ATM, Token Ring, FDDI, Packet over SONET.",

      "html": "Good points. Have you considered the costs within a limited world view though? That is, if you included the entire world of costs, relative to productivity in the past, what would the actual status of your question be? For example there is no doubt that technology increases the productive power of an economy. And this increase is relative, all else being equal. So how much did a 64k link technology increase productivity in the 80&#39;s compared to a 10G one today? I dont have a scientifically priced answer. But I remember working on 64k multiplexors and the price improvement &#39;felt&#39; as good as a 10G today. The thing which I forecast is tipping the balance against your case is the need for more security the more Internet is used. And obviating the security leviathan with some kind of radical new technology, much as the Internet did at inception is surely the objective of the likes of you and I, rather than to relax and pretend &#39;everything is fine&#39;",
