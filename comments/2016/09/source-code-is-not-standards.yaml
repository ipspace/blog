  html: Interesting, Jeff. I had the impression that IETF was a full-time gig for
    many folks. Essentially a way for vendors to make sure their interests are represented.

  html: '&quot;... you MUST understand how things work ...&quot;<br />Even more important
    for troubleshooting and fixing the problem is to understand how things MUST work,
    what is the proper behavior on the wire. And that&#39;s where standard comes handy.
    But one must be able to properly interpret normative language to understand and
    implement the standard the right way.'

  html: Most open source projects start with poor documentation. I wouldn&#39;t systematically
    dismiss the whole concept just because of a rough start and some bad implementations.
    I don&#39;t think ospf had a good start either and that was with the IETF. Good
    open source projects will grow and mature if they get a sufficiently large community.<br
    /><br />One thing is certain though. Vendors will have a hard time protecting
    their interests with open source projects, although that won&#39;t stop them from
    trying.<br /><br />in my opinion both can cohexist. Anything that wins the mass
    adoption race deserves to be a standard. It&#39;s called de-facto standard.

  html: I believe in running code and rough consensus. When all there is, is consensus,
    it can be the consensus of the insane. <br /><br />There are some things that
    are just too complex and fast-moving to standardize, and the best you can hope
    for is a reference implementation.

  html: 'I think the purpose of standards is to allow customers to  mix and match
    vendors knowing that if the vendors are standards complaint then the boxes will
    iterop. If there was a requirement on every standard, that is adopted, to be support
    by open-source reference implementation then it would really help encourage adoption
    and also avoid vendor lock in.<br />We see a lot of standards where there are
    only proprietary implementations and customers have no choice but to go to one
    of the big vendors to solve their problem. '
