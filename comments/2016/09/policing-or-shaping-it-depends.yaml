    html: I tried to schedule a podcast with the authors, but for whatever reason
      they weren&#39;t interested. Will wait for papers and conference talks to appear...

  html: One more promising congestion control algorithm is BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth
    RRT), which is interesting, that it pays no attention in congestion window at
    all, it uses just real bandwidth per last three RTTs and resets this time to time
    to reflect real case (bandwidth can vary with time). What do you think, Ivan,
    about this new algorithm?

  html: Shaping and policing is not an exclusive OR problem. On the egress you use
    shaping, on the ingress you use policing. They should always go in pairs to ensure
    that design contracts are implemented properly on a link.<br />However, shaping
    may introduce extra IP packet delay variation at each hop, so you may want to
    limit your shaping/policing pairs only to those links where a congestion could
    really happen.<br />Most network connections in LANs or core networks are oversized,
    so congestion would never happen there. On such links shaping/policing should
    not be configured. <br /><br />If there is a policing, but no corresponding shaping,
    then I would write a material audit finding in my audit report... :-) <br />
