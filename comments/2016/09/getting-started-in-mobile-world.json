Big mistake, things I took for granted and were well known practices for previous 10 years never penetrated the mobile world. Even the people managing the mobile voice switches in 2012 never heard of SIP. Like prvious commenters said its a closed obscure and archane world. Its like instead of developing a networking stack from a position and goal of openess it was developed from paranoia. Anyways for people starting out 5g points to a more conventional architecture, but that is 5 years out. For those stuck with 3.5g like HSPA and 4g LTE, best of luck. After 10 successful years in data networking I was out the door in 11 months of mobile/cellular carrier. ",

      "html": "The 3GPP architecture is very well designed. I have also come from generic networking. And I was surprised to the positive side, that in mobile networks they did a lot of things much much better. They were not just talking about things, but they have created working solutions. 3GPP is the most successful standardization body. <br />And all this stuff is easy to learn, very logical. You just have to look at with fresh eyes and open mind... :-) <br />There are tons of tutorial books and presentations to learn it... :-) NOT the Wikipedia. :-)<br />By the way, IMS is also a big success. VoIP done finally properly... :-) Lot of people still deny it, because they are still not able to grasp the ideas. But almost all fixed telco voice networks are moved now, and VoLTE is conquering the world. Even Apple had to surrender... :-) <br />So do not give up. It is not trivial, but it is worth to learn it. Understanding TDM, PDH, SDH, SS7, IN helps a lot. In real professions you do not just go for easy recipes, but you really study the history of the trade. You analyze how the decision were done, what failed, and what succeeded and why. And then everything is so logical... :-) <br />",

      "html": "In my opinion a good point to start with is the understanding of GPRS. This technology added the packet-switched functionality to the old GSM networks. GPRS, EDGE then 3G, 4G etc brought advances to the radio access technology by improving uplink and downlink speeds. The  Cisco GGSN devices, for instance support future 3GPP access technologies through simple software upgrades. <br />As in the pure IP world there are certain traffic flows that require be very well understood. Knowing how a terminal attaches to GPRS and how a PDP Context Activation is done is key in the initial understanding of this telecommunication world. <br />SGSN + GGSN = nodes that support GPRS - represent the core network nodes that provide data capability to different cellular networks.<br />Specific telecommunication functionalities are implemented with various interconnections (mostly signaling) between SGSN and other nodes (MSC, BSC, GGSN, HLR etc) and are represented as specific and specialized logical interfaces (Gn, Gi, Gr, etc).<br />Both Cisco and Ericson have nice documents that present the overall GPRS architecture (SGSN, GGSN)  \u2013 as well as their interaction with specific telecommunication nodes. Also the 3GPP specifications provide solid database with specific telecomm standards. <br /><br />",
