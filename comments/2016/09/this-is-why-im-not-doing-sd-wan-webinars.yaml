    html: Hi Mike, nice to hear from you!<br /><br />I agree with all you wrote, apart
      from the &quot;you can ask&quot; bit. If a vendor is not ready to publish their
      documentation online in 2016, I&#39;m not willing to spend my time on researching
      them. <br /><br />Also, I always ask for technical documentation (configuration
      and design guides) and it&#39;s amazing how many times the vendors who contacted
      me on their own don&#39;t want to hear about that.

    info for independent research, buy you can ask. All of those vendors you mentioned
    do have, I think, SD-WAN products. '

  html: Interesting to see a noted miss (in docs?) on the part of Viptela. We started
    looking at them because at least one large ISP is already offering services based
    on their products, which makes one think that they are &quot;mature&quot; enough
    to be supported at large scale...

  html: Citrix doesn&#39;t offer their technical documentation online. However, if
    you sign up for a free trial on the website, they do provide access to documentation
    to support the trial.

  html: Have you looked at Viprinet yet?<br />(https://www.viprinet.com/en/why-viprinet/sd-wan)<br
    />Quick scan on their website also does not show any documentation yet, but any
    reason they are not on the watchlist?

  html: This is really a sad subject. I agree that most people are just doing marketing
    testing with us while not putting any relevant feature out there.<br /><br />I&#39;m
    yet to find somebody with a comprehensive description of working features.<br
    /><br />They all talk about theoretical benefits, that are indeed interesting
    in some cases, but it&#39;s just an ocean of marketing crap.
