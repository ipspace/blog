          "html": "hi Ivan,<br /><br />Appreciate your insight on issues like these, as always. Of note to me was your comment that &quot;Most solutions misuse ARP requests to identify host IP addresses...&quot;, to which I have struggled with myself when deploying these things.<br /><br />For example, a limitation of LISP ESM in the past for me has been silent hosts, and I believe that Cumulus redistribute ARP suffers from a similar pain point. It seems that speak-when-spoken-to hosts (cluster IPs, VIPs), for example, require contingency plans and workarounds, sometimes painful, to deploy these solutions.<br /><br />I personally have not heard of any movements to try and deal with this by alternate fabric discovery mechanisms, but would be curious to hear. For me, this is one of the major stumbling points toward it being viable and not a nightmare to deploy.",
