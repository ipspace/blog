  html: I think the majority of enterprises should start with &quot;everything in
    area 0&quot; unless:<br />1 - Summarisation in order to make the route tables
    slightly more human friendly.<br />2 - Reduced failure domain.  Want to exchange
    routes with a firewall?  Have lots of WAN links where you expect a fair amount
    of churn?  Here&#39;s an area (or two) for those.<br />

  html: 'Mobile backhaul is a good example of an multi-area topology - suppose you
    have a hub (with 2 routers) and 2-3K spokes (cell sites and link going to each
    hub router, ie. 2 uplinks per cell site). In this scenario cell router is quite
    simple piece of hardware with basic OSPF NSSA support. The link between hub routers
    used as intra-area connection (i.e. 2-3k vlans per hub-spoke topology). Hub routers
    advertise summarized route to the backbone, operator have flexibility to have
    ECMP or active/standby configuration on a per-cell site basis. With modern routing
    hardware on a hub side you can enable various additional features such as non-stop
    routing... '
