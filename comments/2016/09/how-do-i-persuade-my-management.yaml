  html: I agree with most of the post, going guerrilla style is not only good to convince
    management but to gain experience and learn from your own mistakes.<br /><br />However,
    careful with this statement:<br /><br />&gt; touching network devices in real
    time (which should be the goal of automation)<br /><br />We are talking about
    the configuration plane. It&#39;s perfectly fine and probably desirable to not
    do things in real time and have a system that instead:<br /><br />1. Validates
    input.<br />2. Checks is doable to merge configuration.<br />3. Determines if
    change is critical and ask for approval in that case.<br />4. Applies changes.<br
    />5. Reports result of applying changes.<br /><br />Note that we are talking a
    minute maybe if step 3 is not needed and hours if it is.<br /><br />Configuration
    only defines the rules of engagement. If you need to change the behavior of your
    network in real time we are talking about the control plane and then the game
    completely changes.
