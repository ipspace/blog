      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />thank you, very good overview and &quot;problem statement&quot;. I&#39;ve a couple of comments though. Unfortunately (namely from the perspective from environments with heterogenuous clients = all large enterprise) it is yet more complex, including:<br />- starting from Win8 Windows even sends DHCPv6 Solicits when the m-Flag is *not* set (which in turn means, amongst others, that you can only prevent DHCPv6 from being used by stopping the local service!).<br />- the behavior of Linux actually varies heavily between distros (see also sources below); I&#39;ve seen/configured Linux systems using DHCPv6 address in addition to SLAAC provisioned ones.<br />- as you stated, the interaction with source address selection is a complete mess. At some point even rule 5.5 from RFC6724 might come into play and similar nasty stuff.<br /><br />There&#39;s an IETF draft on some of this (disclaimer: I&#39;m involved):<br />https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-v6ops-dhcpv6-slaac-problem-05.txt<br />also:<br />https://www.ernw.de/download/ERNW_Whitepaper_IPv6_RAs_RDNSS_DHCPv6_Conflicting_Parameters.pdf<br />https://ripe70.ripe.net/wp-content/uploads/presentations/132-ERNW_RIPE70_IPv6_Behavior_Conflicting_Environments_v0_92_short.pdf<br /><br />thanks for bringing attention to this space ;-)<br /><br />Enno",
