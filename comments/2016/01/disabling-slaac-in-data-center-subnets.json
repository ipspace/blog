      "html": "As I commented on your other article, turning off RA (and DHCPv6 relay) on server nets is exactly what I do. First hop &quot;router&quot; is an ASA 5585-X failover pair, so using RAs for redundancy isn&#39;t something I need. Not that doing that (RA as an FHRP) works all that well anyway in my experience.<br /><br />But as always, one size rarely fits all...",
