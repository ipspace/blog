  html: 'Great post, Ivan!<br /><br />It&#39;s intriguing that many people assume
    you need L2 DCI and then when you interview them about their actual needs, it
    turns out they don&#39;t really need it all. '

    html: So true, a common refrain from many up the chain is &quot;lets not get caught
      up in the weeds&quot; which is what people who have decision making power over
      technology say when the don&#39;t understand their area and don&#39;t want their
      underlings to rock the boat and jeopardize their chances of promotion.

  html: Sad truth Ivan, this post is a nice start in the y. 2016 ;)<br /><br />&quot;It
    is a big management problem in my opinion, when decisions are made while playing
    golf instead of a whiteboard session with the network team.&quot;<br /><br />The
    21st century management issue in one sentence! Sadly so true...

  html: Cloud providers are selling unicorns as well. Advertising feature sets that
    aren&#39;t fully baked or on the roadmap for next year. Documentation from last
