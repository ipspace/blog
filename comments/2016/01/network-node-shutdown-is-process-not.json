Here is a good paper of Bertrand Duvivier about this feature: http://fr.slideshare.net/bduvivie/bgp-graceful-shutdown-ios-xr, covered by the RFC Olivier mentionned.<br /><br />From a network perspective, I think everything is already covered in this post.<br /><br />From an IOS-XR system and infrastructure point of view, it&#39;s recommended to put RSP/RP in rommon (config-register 0x0 location all) and then reload the router (reload location all). This avoids potential  filesystem corruption. Once the router in rommon, you can safely proceed to the power isolation. <br />Note you&#39;ll have to manually reconfigure the config-register to 0x102 or 0x2102 when turning on the router later to boot on the committed software.<br /><br />Fred<br /><br />",

Please don&#39;t quote vendor marketing materials and don&#39;t conflate packet loss (and consequent performance issues) with session loss. <br /><br />TCP can survive for 30 seconds, so you effectively claimed SPB can converge in 30 seconds. Hooray!<br /><br />See http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/10/what-happens-when-data-center-fabric.html for actual technical details, and they apply to every single fabric architecture (the differences between various solutions are in failure detection, flooding and convergence timers).",
