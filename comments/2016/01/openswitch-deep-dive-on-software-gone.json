          "html": "Nolan,<br /><br />The equivalent of Cumulus&#39; switchd in openswitch is the the ops-switchd (also available at the git repo), that uses plugin interfaces to provide the datapath (opennsl being one of them, but there are already plugins to use ovs or p4 as data planes). All of the plugins are open, and the opennsl implementation happens to use a binary blob from the ASIC vendor, but this is their decision as it&#39;s their intelectual property. HPE actually worked along with Broadcom to ensure that their kernel drivers where release as GPL in order to enable the community to rebuild the kernel. Other plugins like the P4   for ASICs could be completely open if the ASIC vendor decides to do so.<br /><br />The statistic about binary proprietary code is quite misleading since this may vary depending of the version of the code shipping, and again this is going to vary on per-platform basis. Even most Linux distributions ship with binary firmware for certain hardware. Unlike Cumulus, anyone can download the code, build it, modify it, and even run the regression test suites. The virtual appliances from OpenSwitch came with full source code (since they don&#39;t have ASIC dependencies), where areas Cumulus doesn&#39;t make the source for VX available.<br /><br />Open Source is more than just the code, is about community and direction. OpenSwitch has open mailing lists, IRC channels, code reviews and bug trackers to enable a developer community. While they are challenges to be addressed in how to make the solutions more open with any ASIC, I think the OpenSwitch project has taken the steps in the right direction. <br /><br />Diego Dompe<br />OpenSwitch Developer/ HPE Employee<br />",

Switchd is an API server that clients program with RFC3549 netlink messages over a socket, and it in turn programs the ASIC via a proprietary SDK.  OpenNSL is an API server that clients program using OpenNSL-specific messages over a socket, and it in turn programs the ASIC via a proprietary SDK.<br /><br />Since we&#39;re using standard netlink messages, we don&#39;t need a separate &quot;ops-switchd&quot; translator to take messages from (for example) quagga to give to the code that actually programs the ASIC.<br /><br />&gt; HPE actually worked along with Broadcom to ensure that their kernel drivers where release as GPL<br /><br />We&#39;ve been working with Broadcom on that as well, as was BigSwitch.  We&#39;ve been shipping the GPLed kernel modules in Cumulus Linux since our first public release in 2013.<br /><br />&gt; Unlike Cumulus, anyone can download the code, build it, modify it, and even run the regression test suites.<br /><br />The only part of this that is true is that we don&#39;t release our regression test suite.  All the code and instructions to build it are available, so anyone interested in building a CentCumulus would just have to remove our trademarks.  And multiple people have built things using the code we&#39;ve released.<br /><br />-- <br />Nolan Leake<br />co-founder/CTO, Cumulus Networks",
