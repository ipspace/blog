  html: 'Hi Ivan,<br /><br />thank you, very good overview and &quot;problem statement&quot;.
    I&#39;ve a couple of comments though. Unfortunately (namely from the perspective
    from environments with heterogenuous clients = all large enterprise) it is yet
    more complex, including:<br />- starting from Win8 Windows even sends DHCPv6 Solicits
    when the m-Flag is *not* set (which in turn means, amongst others, that you can
    only prevent DHCPv6 from being used by stopping the local service!).<br />- the
    behavior of Linux actually varies heavily between distros (see also sources below);
    I&#39;ve seen/configured Linux systems using DHCPv6 address in addition to SLAAC
    provisioned ones.<br />- as you stated, the interaction with source address selection
    is a complete mess. At some point even rule 5.5 from RFC6724 might come into play
    and similar nasty stuff.<br /><br />There&#39;s an IETF draft on some of this
    (disclaimer: I&#39;m involved):<br />https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-v6ops-dhcpv6-slaac-problem-05.txt<br
    />also:<br />https://www.ernw.de/download/ERNW_Whitepaper_IPv6_RAs_RDNSS_DHCPv6_Conflicting_Parameters.pdf<br

    /><br />thanks for bringing attention to this space ;-)<br /><br />Enno'

  html: It looks like windows always sends DHCPv6 request as last resort regardless
    of RA message. Enno Rey has published his observations of effects of RA messages
    with different operating systems in &quot;IPv6 Router Advertisement Flags, RDNSS
    and DHCPv6 Conflicting Configurations&quot; paper.<br />I found it very interesting.

    html: Are you using DHCPv6 for server IPv6 assignments? Aren&#39;t server networks
      the one area you would prefer RAs over DHCP?<br /><br />I&#39;ve built server
      networks that relied upon DHCP before, primarily using Infoblox redundant appliances
      with DHCP reserverations, but I&#39;ve always thought of RAs as being freedom
      from an risky outside dependency.

    html: We use static assignments for all servers, so no SLAAC or DHCP. DHCPv6 is
      easy to avoid by simply not doing any DHCP server/relay on the server nets,
      but to keep servers from generating SLAAC addresses I have to disable RAs. Thank
      you Windows.<br /><br />(With SLAAC addresses creating firewall rules would
      be... difficult)

  html: Guys, maybe i&#39;m totally wrong but this problem is adressed in RFC 6724
    (that replaced RFC 3484) concerning default address selection algorithm (DAS)
    and Happy Eyeballs (RFC 6555), don&#39;t you think ?<br /><br />Maybe i&#39;m
    living in an utopian world but i always been under the impression that source/destination
    address selection has nothing to do with the method that the OS used to get one
    (SLAAC, static, DHCPv6), even if each OS has different way to react to flag bit
    inside RAs...<br /><br />Am i totally wrong ?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Martin

    html: Thanks for your reply Michael. <br /><br />I was under the impression that
      NCSI is more a replacement/modification of RFC 6724 for selecting IPv6 or IPv4
      but was not related to the selection of a specific IPv6 source address (static
      ip address preferred over SLAAC address for example).<br /><br />I think that
      i need to make some reading.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Martin

    html: Hi Martin,<br /><br />your impression is correct. I just wanted to say that
      there is not only RFC6724 but each OS seems to use it&#39;s own additional functions
      to determine what address to use. <br /><br />BR<br />Michael

  html: In theory that actually shouldn&#39;t be the case. However, reality is different
    - you just cannot rely on RFC 6724 today. For example, Windows uses an additional
    process called NCSI in order to figure out what address to use (at least for IPv4/IPv6)
    - see Ed Horleys Book on IPv6 Administration on Windows.<br /><br />BR,<br />Michael

  html: '... and all this circus instead of having a way of statically configuring
    interface ID and getting the prefix from RA. <br /><br />Let me explain : <br
    /> - server guys like static IP assignments (pretty much the same way we like
    static IPs on loopbacks).<br /> - in 99% of cases you can address a whole organisation&#39;s
    infrastructure in 64 bits (because you could do it in less than 32).<br /> - then
    how about seeing IPv6 for what it really became : 64 bit (max) routing prefix
    + 64 bit &quot;something ID&quot; (call it interface ID, host ID or whatever)<br
    /><br />There can always be an argument of how this is not good or how this can
    be accomplished otherwise (??? DHCP ??? - please NO), but change-wise IPv6 is
    sometimes already going too far (doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s in the good direction)
    to scare the hell out of most IT people. Isn&#39;t it concievable to give them
    little breaks on some issues ? Especially if we want deployment...'

  html: I always say - do as you would do with IPv4 =&gt; DHCPv6 with onlink flag
    set.<br />For datacenters same thing expect vlan where static address is needed
    =&gt; No RA<br />You don&#39;t have to explain so much and it&#39;s much easier
    to deploy it for those who is beginner in IPv6.
