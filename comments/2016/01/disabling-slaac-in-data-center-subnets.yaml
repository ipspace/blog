  html: As I commented on your other article, turning off RA (and DHCPv6 relay) on
    server nets is exactly what I do. First hop &quot;router&quot; is an ASA 5585-X
    failover pair, so using RAs for redundancy isn&#39;t something I need. Not that
    doing that (RA as an FHRP) works all that well anyway in my experience.<br /><br
    />But as always, one size rarely fits all...

  html: Apart from using plain old &quot;default routing&quot; (I don&#39;t see a
    major problem with this), you can also play with the prefix (suppress or non-/64).<br
    /><br />Besides, pushing an &quot;RA or nothing&quot; approach is very energy-consumming
    in a lot of places (where IT people barely understand IPv4).

  html: I don&#39;t think IPv6 RA is an alternative to VRRP. Fast failover does not
    work with RAs. We use static routing and do not even configure RA on our Juniper
    gateways. I know noone who does it otherwise in a server environment.
