That was called &quot;lock &amp; key&quot; in Cisco IOS, and no reasonable firewall would use something like that on traffic coming from the (untrusted) outside zone. <br /><br />Trusting source IP addresses coming from the Internet == guaranteed fail ;) I don&#39;t even have to be in the forwarding path - all I need to do is grab your prefix (or start advertising a more specific one) after you&#39;ve drilled the hole in the firewall, and I&#39;m in. Thank you very much ;))",

          "html": "Humm.. I had in mind something that requires two TCP connections like FTP where a new connection is allowed as part of an existing one but the statement you quote is unbiased, a source port changing towards a web server.<br /><br />I have heard worse things from a major firewall vendor, like SYN+ACK retransmission requiring a matching new SYN from the client.<br /><br />To the point of the article, I agree, Podcasters are in a trustable position and should think hard. Listeners: Don&#39;t believe everything people say blindly.",

I read it as &quot;same session&quot; and he may beusing more metadata to link them (DPI?).<br />Podcasters are not trustable because they post. Trust is a complicated (and abused) quality IMHO.",
