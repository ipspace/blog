  html: the most important bit is that every new magic VPN solution has to point out
    that they have better performance than OpenVPN... which sort of makes OpenVPN
    the reference, no? :-)

  html: To their credit, one of the original use cases of this technology was simply
    leveraging the remote-access VPN capability to help those in need with bypassing
    any &quot;pesky&quot; Great Firewalls (http://www.vpngate.net/). And let&#39;s
    face it, OpenVPN could use a facelift.

    html: in a single location you mean. Yes, true. Except if the software is smart
      enough to check if both VPN endpoints are not directly joinable over pure ethernet.
      Otherwise you would have to make a Ethernet VPN tunnel to a remote location,
      and then do a second VPN connection back to the host which is in the same LAN
      as you are. Life is so easier with bridging. I can die in peace now. https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/3f/6c/b7/3f6cb7f80fca58115e473560d2d43977.jpg

  html: An ethernet bridge will always be an ethernet bridge, no matter how hard the
    layer 7 application tries to hide the complexities.. the fundamentals of networking
    still apply. &quot;Just because you can, does not mean you should&quot;....

  html: Apart from right or wrong discussion, this is the only open source SSTP server
    software available today. I don&#39;t want to use PPTP for security reason. I
    don&#39;t understand why Microsoft doesn&#39;t provide SSTP on desktop version
    of Windows software. They should get rid of PPTP and provide SSTP on all versions
    of Windows as they did with the PPTP. PPTP is crap.

  html: Oh yeah Ivan, it allows ARP/IP Spoofing and Man in the middle without even
    having to be there. They&#39;re right, it makes life really easier.
