      "html": "no mention of otv :) <br />problem with all l2 dcis as you mentioned are the typical l2 challenges: broadcasts, arps, unicast floods, stp, wrong choice of fhrp gateways.<br />to the best of my knowledge otv was built from ground up with all these in mind and has in built mechanisms to  stop those control/data plane issues.<br />but as you also said most of these are just hacks around the real issues: applications need to be written correctly. If developers and network engineers go through the software dev lifecycle together and input where necessary most of these hacks would be reduced.",

They have good experience with OTV from previous deployments.<br />2. Going with L3 requires at least 1/3 more equipment (assume FW cluster in main site and single FW in DR site).<br />3. The main reason was managing FW rules between two independent FWs.<br />They are concerned that independent FW policies will be inconsistent and thus things won&#39;t work in d day.<br />I couldn&#39;t find good enough arguments to counter their arguments, so we will give their approach a try.<br />I&#39;m interested to hear your opinions on this scenario ",
