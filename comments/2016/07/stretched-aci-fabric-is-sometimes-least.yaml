  html: I agree with your thoughts 100%. I really cringe when I hear about L2 DCI.

  html: 'no mention of otv :) <br />problem with all l2 dcis as you mentioned are
    the typical l2 challenges: broadcasts, arps, unicast floods, stp, wrong choice
    of fhrp gateways.<br />to the best of my knowledge otv was built from ground up
    with all these in mind and has in built mechanisms to  stop those control/data
    plane issues.<br />but as you also said most of these are just hacks around the
    real issues: applications need to be written correctly. If developers and network
    engineers go through the software dev lifecycle together and input where necessary
    most of these hacks would be reduced.'

  html: i too am stuck at a place where they stretch layer 2.  no amount of education
    will change their minds.  when asked why they designed it this way, their answer
    is always &quot;because&quot;.  i cry myself to sleep every night

    html: When (and not if) their solution fails I bet they will still blame it on
      you!<br /><br />Anonymous and pessimistic<br />

    html: 'To address point #3, this is why you should use a firewall management system
      so your policies and objects are consistent across different firewalls.'

  html: 'I&#39;m in similar situation with a customer of mine, however few different
    factors:<br />The country is pretty small, and the customer has 2 independent
    10G circuits between the DCs.<br />They can actually have whatever circuits they
    want, as they control the fibres between the DCs.<br />They still want to stretch
    L2 across the DCs but using OTV.<br />I was preaching layer 3 and I even got their
    attention for a short while, but they had few good arguments:<br />1. They have
    good experience with OTV from previous deployments.<br />2. Going with L3 requires
    at least 1/3 more equipment (assume FW cluster in main site and single FW in DR
    site).<br />3. The main reason was managing FW rules between two independent FWs.<br
    />They are concerned that independent FW policies will be inconsistent and thus
    things won&#39;t work in d day.<br />I couldn&#39;t find good enough arguments
    to counter their arguments, so we will give their approach a try.<br />I&#39;m
    interested to hear your opinions on this scenario '
