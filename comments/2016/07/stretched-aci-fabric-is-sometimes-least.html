            <div class="comment-content">no mention of otv :) <br />problem with all l2 dcis as you mentioned are the typical l2 challenges: broadcasts, arps, unicast floods, stp, wrong choice of fhrp gateways.<br />to the best of my knowledge otv was built from ground up with all these in mind and has in built mechanisms to  stop those control/data plane issues.<br />but as you also said most of these are just hacks around the real issues: applications need to be written correctly. If developers and network engineers go through the software dev lifecycle together and input where necessary most of these hacks would be reduced.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;m in similar situation with a customer of mine, however few different factors:<br />The country is pretty small, and the customer has 2 independent 10G circuits between the DCs.<br />They can actually have whatever circuits they want, as they control the fibres between the DCs.<br />They still want to stretch L2 across the DCs but using OTV.<br />I was preaching layer 3 and I even got their attention for a short while, but they had few good arguments:<br />1. They have good experience with OTV from previous deployments.<br />2. Going with L3 requires at least 1/3 more equipment (assume FW cluster in main site and single FW in DR site).<br />3. The main reason was managing FW rules between two independent FWs.<br />They are concerned that independent FW policies will be inconsistent and thus things won&#39;t work in d day.<br />I couldn&#39;t find good enough arguments to counter their arguments, so we will give their approach a try.<br />I&#39;m interested to hear your opinions on this scenario </div>
