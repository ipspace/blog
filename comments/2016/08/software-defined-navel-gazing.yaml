  html: Loved the commentary on whether or not to transition into programming as that&#39;s
    been a nagging decision for the past few years. I&#39;d love an entire episode
    on the topic. Thanks all!

  html: Hi Ivan.<br />Long time listener, first time caller. Since you asked for suggestions
    on what listeners would like, I can&#39;t seem to find much information about
    why custom silicon (like Cisco ASICs), has less CPU power, but runs faster than
    X86 CPUs. I would love to learn more about router/switches hardware architecture,
    and ASICs and CPUs. Namely, what physical hardware is limiting SDN...<br /><br
    />I am a Linux networking sub-system fan, and am waiting for Linux to get better
    performance than proprietary solutions.<br /><br />I will be listening/waiting
    for your reply..<br /><br />Regards,<br />Justin Wilson<br />
