    html: '@Anonymous#1: Anonymous#2 totally got it.<br /><br />First, you need a
      recording crew if you want to have good recording (yeah, I did use GoPro a few
      times, but the quality is what it is). <br /><br />Next, if you want to publish
      the materials, you better get the release forms signed by every attendee...
      and them some of them won&#39;t ask any questions.'
