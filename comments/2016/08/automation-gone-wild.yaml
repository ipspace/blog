  html: 1. Canary changes and test them before...<br />2. Doing incremental rollouts
    starting on some staging environment if possibly <br /><br />that applies to any
    configuration change, code deployment, software/OS upgrade, etc you want to perform,<br
    /><br />and remember that automation doesn&#39;t mean doing things unattended.
    If you are doing risky changes you can always monitor the automated rolling update
    and abort if something smells fishy.<br />

  html: As long as &quot;Hit and Run&quot; approach will be used, nothing will be
    different.

  html: To the point about the firewall management software....sounds a lot like Panorama
    from Palo Alto Networks. I love their firewalls, but I&#39;m not aware of any
    equivalent to &quot;reload in 5&quot; or &quot;commit confirm 5&quot;, so if you
    brick it you brick it. For the engineer in that scenario, had he done the update
    as one large group, he would have just more driving.<br /><br />Having said that,
    I&#39;m all for automating certain things, and of course testing this in the lab/pre-production
    first.

  html: And the automation software should of course detect if the change was successful
    before it went on to the next device. Even RANCID could do this in 2006.

    html: Test after the change. Look at ToDD (on keepingitclassless.net) or test-driven
      network development (http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/11/test-driven-network-development-with.html)

  html: How to define successful though? Completed or committed doesn&#39;t always
    mean correct.
