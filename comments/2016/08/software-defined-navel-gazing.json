      "html": "Hi Ivan.<br />Long time listener, first time caller. Since you asked for suggestions on what listeners would like, I can&#39;t seem to find much information about why custom silicon (like Cisco ASICs), has less CPU power, but runs faster than X86 CPUs. I would love to learn more about router/switches hardware architecture, and ASICs and CPUs. Namely, what physical hardware is limiting SDN...<br /><br />I am a Linux networking sub-system fan, and am waiting for Linux to get better performance than proprietary solutions.<br /><br />I will be listening/waiting for your reply..<br /><br />Regards,<br />Justin Wilson<br />",
