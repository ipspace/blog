            <div class="comment-content">Deployement error ? I&#39;d say protocol design error.<br /><br />Their system consisted of 8 servers. Thee servers worked together as one system. So I am sure there was network communication between them. Thus there was a protocol. A proprietary protcol at the application layer.<br /><br />They changed their protocol. They changed the meaning of one bit (the power peg flag). But supposedly their 8 servers were not able to figure out that one of them was talking an old version of their proprietary protocol. This was the root of their problem.<br /><br />They could have had a protocol-version in their packet-header. They could have used TLV-encoding instead of fixed-size, fixed-location, fixed-meaning encoding. They could have done version negotiating during connection establishment. They could have done something. But it seems they did nothing at their own protocol-level to prevent these incompatabilities.<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">As it always happens in such cases: many small mistakes led to one big disaster. it is not about automation, but about proper design and supervision on all stages. if they would have installed 8th server correctly the would still have been sitting on the time bomb waiting for the right circumstances to explode</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Automation is a powerful tool just like redundancy.<br />By now most network engineers have learned that redundancy has its own challenges and is not automatically equal to robustness. Similarly, automation does not equate to correctness.<br /><br />I can&#39;t agree with Ivan on this one. More automation would not have helped at all in this case. More thinking was needed at all levels: design, planning, testing, monitoring, system integration, etc. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">I think both Hank and yourself missed the point. Yes, there are many things that could have been made more resilient (I totally agree with Hank&#39;s remarks), and who knows how many skeletons were hidden in those closets, BUT expecting a human to repeat a long and convoluted process flawlessly eight times in a row borders on insanity.<br /><br />Listen to this podcast http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/11/flipit-cloud-orchestrating-it-as.html if you want to hear more details from people who had to solve a similar problem.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Well yes, I completely agree with the part involving humans repeating complicated processes.<br /><br />I was thinking about processes at all levels, for guys managing billions of dollars it looks like they skimped almost everywhere:<br />-operational: check-lists (did we do all the servers?), verification by a second technician, supervision by a software engineer, monitoring of error messages.<br />-change management: you have a backout plan, right?<br />-system design: transaction anomaly monitoring with safe-guards (in networking has this is BPDU guard, uni-directional link detection, etc.)<br />-management oversight seems lacking<br /><br />The point I was trying to make is that automating an incorrect procedure will not help and that automation, as a software activity, has all the problems associated with software development.<br /><br /></div>
