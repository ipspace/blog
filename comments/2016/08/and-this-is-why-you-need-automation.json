      "html": "Deployement error ? I&#39;d say protocol design error.<br /><br />Their system consisted of 8 servers. Thee servers worked together as one system. So I am sure there was network communication between them. Thus there was a protocol. A proprietary protcol at the application layer.<br /><br />They changed their protocol. They changed the meaning of one bit (the power peg flag). But supposedly their 8 servers were not able to figure out that one of them was talking an old version of their proprietary protocol. This was the root of their problem.<br /><br />They could have had a protocol-version in their packet-header. They could have used TLV-encoding instead of fixed-size, fixed-location, fixed-meaning encoding. They could have done version negotiating during connection establishment. They could have done something. But it seems they did nothing at their own protocol-level to prevent these incompatabilities.<br />",

Yes, there are many things that could have been made more resilient (I totally agree with Hank&#39;s remarks), and who knows how many skeletons were hidden in those closets, BUT expecting a human to repeat a long and convoluted process flawlessly eight times in a row borders on insanity.<br /><br />Listen to this podcast http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/11/flipit-cloud-orchestrating-it-as.html if you want to hear more details from people who had to solve a similar problem.",

Similarly, automation does not equate to correctness.<br /><br />I can&#39;t agree with Ivan on this one. More automation would not have helped at all in this case. More thinking was needed at all levels: design, planning, testing, monitoring, system integration, etc. ",
