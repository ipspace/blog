If you are doing risky changes you can always monitor the automated rolling update and abort if something smells fishy.<br />",

I love their firewalls, but I&#39;m not aware of any equivalent to &quot;reload in 5&quot; or &quot;commit confirm 5&quot;, so if you brick it you brick it. For the engineer in that scenario, had he done the update as one large group, he would have just more driving.<br /><br />Having said that, I&#39;m all for automating certain things, and of course testing this in the lab/pre-production first.",
