You just have to have the right pieces in place.  I work for a very large enterprise; no startup sauce around here.",

      "html": "@crzdriver thanks for yuor respnose. Would you mind elaborating bit more on vendor mix for these 30 devics ?  Some of the environments I  am looking at have around 2000-3000 devices and 6-7 vendors for various fucntions and  15-20 different device platform from those vendors. I  am trying to understand what all environments can Ansible scale upto and what would be an idea environment enterprises should be looking at more enterprise grade automation/orchestration platforms while keeping in mind that platform allows extensibility.",

      "html": "2 platforms, compute fabric, cookie-cutter, rinse-and-repeat.  You&#39;re trying to boil the ocean.  Our data centers are large-scale as well, and I&#39;d never get anything done if I worried about automating the whole blasted thing.  Using that as an excuse for an enterprise to not adopt automation is like saying you won&#39;t adopt cloud because you still need bare-metal workloads.  It&#39;s an asinine argument at best.  Out of your 3K devices that you manage each day, do you find things that you do over, and over, and over again?  Cool, automate it.  Ansible doesn&#39;t support that platform?  Learn how to use telnetlib and Paramiko (as an aside, 90% of my tasks were in templates which are universal).  Ansible doesn&#39;t have a module to do x, y, and z?  Even better, write a [python/c/java/go/pascal] module to perform the task, and use Ansible to call it over a list of hosts.  This isn&#39;t about Ansible or any other automation tool.  It&#39;s about your perception on how you do your job.  It&#39;s about scaling yourself as a network engineer.  I&#39;m not going to waste my time trying to write scripts for a one-off build.  But if something comes across my desk that is repeatable or needs to be absolutely consistent, it needs to be done with software.  Ivan said this webinar is to get you &quot;started on your first network automation&quot; project.  I doubt his &quot;hello world&quot; of network automation is to script large-scale brownfield infrastructure build with microservices and unicorn tears.  :)",
