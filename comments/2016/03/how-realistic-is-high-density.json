      "html": "As we got denser, we began to push the limits of UCS oversubscription, but mostly due to the fiber-channel traffic. So we had to increase southbound chassis links from 2 cables to 4 cables, and increase the number of uplinks in the SAN port-channels. Other than that, its hard to outrun the 6200 series fabric interconnects.",

      "html": "@silent rider:<br /><br />Looks like you&#39;re hitting a common limitation of blade architectures. In 2016, I just don\u2019t see the point to blade servers.  Unless you\u2019re running a heavy slant of physical to virtual hosts, it just seems like more complexity, lesser scalability / performance, for little gain.  Even if you\u2019re using UCS for rackmounts, there\u2019s still little win IMO.  It adds a ton of complexity under the guise of simplicity, and it costs an arm and a leg on top of it.  Good old fashion rackmounts are just easier, faster, and more cost effective when it comes to virtualization.  The only selling point I\u2019ve heard for UCS is \u201cwhat happens if your server crashes?\u201d which is a good point for physical servers, but not so much for virtual ones. I would say the one exception might be if you&#39;re running a 100+ virtual hosts.  At that point, the automation capability you get with UCS might start paying off.<br /><br />I run the exact setup Ivan has been mentioning for a while now (4 years) and it works great.  I have two 5596\u2019s, and all our Vmhosts (32 of them) up link into those switches.  We have a number of hosts that have well over 100 VM\u2019s per and they\u2019re not even breaking a sweat.  <br />",
