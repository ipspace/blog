    html: Openswitch, although it might be an interesting idea, it&#39;s years away
      from being production ready. They don&#39;t have available builds to download
      and their hardware compatibility list only has a few TOR switches.

    html: Thanks for the input David; you&#39;re right it may be quite a ways away
      from being production ready. However if that&#39;s a valid mandate for the gentleman&#39;s
      company, then I think starting with something like OpenSwitch is a far cry better
      than trying to re-invent the wheel themselves.<br /><br />Also, I believe that
      things may have changed since you last checked, but I was able to download and
      run OpenSwitch in Virtualbox just fine. Also the build system instructions appear
      pretty complete as well (http://www.openswitch.net/develop/develophome).<br
      /><br />Last, have to agree on the current HCL but I&#39;m sure that won&#39;t
      be much of an issue here soon.

    html: I think OpenSwitch and OpenNetworkLinux both are good places to start if
      someone is interested to build their own network OS. OpenSwitch as a traditional
      L2/L3 platform and OpenNetworkLinux as a SDN - OpenFlow enabled platform.<br
      /><br />on otherhand standalone network OS such as Cumulus, Pica8 are also good
      commercial operating systems. <br />

  html: Might not have OpenSwitch been a reasonable place to recommend his company
    start instead? Sounds like they already get you partway there.<br /><br />(Software

  html: You have to wonder if that was general guidance from management or a true
    mandate. I mean, on the left hand of the slide rule, there are big-brand products
    (safe, but expensive) and on the right hand there are innovative alternatives
    (buy whitebox and write your own OS)... but there are plenty of options in between.
    Branded whitebox comes to mind, like Big Switch, Nuage and others. You can take
    advantage of the cost savings, but you still have one source for both software
    and hardware. I suspect that the overhead of paying for the branded services will
    offset the in-house development costs and technical debt of grow-your-own. Grow-your-own
    is a gamble that you can do it successfully and that the ROI isn&#39;t going to
    drag out past 3 years. I&#39;m not criticizing the idea - if it fits your business
    model, then go for it. But if you can&#39;t tie that effort directly and clearly
    to your business strategy, then I&#39;d consider something with training wheels.<br

  html: Google, Facebook, Amazon created the idea of Open Networking, and dis aggregation.  they
    created this philosophy when it did&#39;nt exist.<br /><br />At the current time,
    we have many Whitebox/ BrightBox hardware vendors (Edge-Core/ Accton , Quanta
    , Dell , HP, etc) and also Multiple opensource and commercial network OS (Big
    Switch, Cumulus, Pica8, OpenSwitch, OpenNetworkLinux, Ocnoc, Dell OS10, Nuage,
    Pluribus, ...) <br /><br />in fact if google was sleeping and suddenly wake up
    at this time, they won&#39;t go for building their own Jupiter, Firehorse, etc.
    they could use an exiting technology.<br /><br /><br />

  html: Excellent executive hubris and ambition leading a company down the garden
    path. Be wary of the people who tell you everything is easy and can be done in
    a day, they usually have no clue about what they are talking about. First problem
    the executive gave them a solution, build a google like network, but no mention
    of the problem they are trying to solve.

  html: 'Hi Ivan,<br />we&#39;re also a &quot;mid-sized European ISP&quot; and we
    do build our own network gear, although not L2 datacenter switches but edge L3
    stuff. We instal them in thousands of remote POPs with no out-of-band management.<br
    /><br />We decided an overall SoC architecture and hired an OEM to assemble our
    custom hardware (at the moment 2*10G+24*1G and 8*10G) in a few thousands units.
    <br /><br />Of course we used &quot;standard building block&quot;, as you call
    them, e.g.: Quagga for OSPF, Exabgp, OpenVSwitch, lldpd, a custom PPPoX/L2TP damon,
    etc.<br /><br />We&#39;ve opted to do dataplane in a dpkd-like way over a great
    userspace stack we licensed from 6WIND (http://www.lightreading.com/carrier-sdn/sdn-technology/italian-sp-deploys-homemade-sdn-appliance/d/d-id/713802).<br
    /><br />Also, we build our own centralised network automation tool, scripting
    tools, a monitoring GUI and even defined our own &quot;cli&quot; with its own
    syntax.<br /><br />We&#39;ve got a rather meshed backbone, so we&#39;re using
    OpenFlow-rules to loadbalance MPLS customer traffic on all the available routes
    based on opportunistic traffic class determination and realtime link capacity
    (most of them are microwave, i.e., time-varying) though a Mixed Integer Programming
    algorithm that uses the libs of a general-purpose commercial solver to find the
    optimal routing strategy. On top of that, we proactively provision backup paths
    and use BFD for fast-reroute.<br /><br />For fun, we&#39;re rewriting part of
    that central controller on GPU (on a pair of Nvidia Telsa K2).<br /><br />All
    this with a staff of 3 people, over the last 1.5 years.<br /><br />If we were
    to start this adventure again, we would honestly do a number of things differently,
    but I think we would follow the same path.<br /><br />I completely agree with
    the &quot;lack of talent&quot; you talked about! Imho networking is still a software-adverse
    field: we find it extremely hard to find networking people that have a solid software
    mentality.<br /><br />If you&#39;d like more details for a chat, feel free to
    get in touch.<br />Giacomo Bernardi (mino@ngi.it)'
