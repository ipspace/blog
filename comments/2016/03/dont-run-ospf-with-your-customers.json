You wrote about connecting Internet via NSSA: http://wiki.nil.com/External_default_route_in_NSSA_area. C&#39;mon a partner network is more trustful than this.<br /><br />Let&#39;s assume there is a mainframe area, core area (OSPF) and the WAN edge (BGP). Would you recommend BGP in the MF area? I would prefer OSPF stub or NSSA areas + floating static routes. A design would be easier comparing to the BGP solution as a double BGP-OSPF redistribution doesn&#39;t look easy to maintain. Of course someone could say &quot;migrate all areas to BGP!&quot;. This is an option in some places. Not everywhere.",

You understood it meant &quot;connecting to Internet&quot;, which might or might not be accurate. I never ever suggested _running OSPF routing protocol_ with a non-trusted entity.<br /><br />Also, &quot;importing AS external routes&quot; is definitely not equal to &quot;establishing OSPF adjacency with an external router&quot;.<br /><br />As for the second part of your question, as always the answer is &quot;it depends&quot;, and I could easily justify at least three different options. Anyway, I try not giving out generic recipes because they are so often misapplied.",

The OSPF configuration is basic and templated using unnumbered links with Vrouter loopback being assigned from IPAM as well as Docker networks host being assigned for IPAM as to avoid duplicate addressing. Lets take this further and say you are advertising docker host routes from the host to the TOR and then doing summarization at the TOR.Then using a centralized controller and fibbing for traffic engineering. <br /><br />I admit this is getting to into the weeds and fiddling with nerd knobs just to do something different. Would there be *any* possible benefit to a solution like this over say BGP and expection routing a la Lapukhov?",

Lets say you have a Docker host running Calico or maybe Contrail where you have a Vrouter shim controlling all traffic in and out of the host. Obviously both Calico and Contrail wisely use BGP but like I said hypothetical the networking team can control the host routing wouldn&#39;t then this qoute apply?<br /><br />&quot;The classic definition of an Autonomous System is a set of routers under a single technical administration&quot;<br />",

I naturally asked &quot;why the hell are you using RIP?&quot; Turns out the routers don&#39;t know anything else apart from OSPF, and the only goal of dynamic routing was to simplify configuration - the customer gets a default (or a couple of prefixes for some nets?), the hub - a prefix to the customer. RIP is easy to configure. It can be filtered by prefixes at any spot just like BGP. It&#39;s supported anywhere. In their case, convergence was not an issue, there was no redundancy, a minute or two of up/down delays didn&#39;t matter.<br /><br />It seems to me like it&#39;s a viable option in a point-to-multipoint design if the spokes are unaware of BGP and are controlled by someone else.
