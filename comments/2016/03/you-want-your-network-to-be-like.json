However if that&#39;s a valid mandate for the gentleman&#39;s company, then I think starting with something like OpenSwitch is a far cry better than trying to re-invent the wheel themselves.<br /><br />Also, I believe that things may have changed since you last checked, but I was able to download and run OpenSwitch in Virtualbox just fine. Also the build system instructions appear pretty complete as well (http://www.openswitch.net/develop/develophome).<br /><br />Last, have to agree on the current HCL but I&#39;m sure that won&#39;t be much of an issue here soon.",

      "html": "You have to wonder if that was general guidance from management or a true mandate. I mean, on the left hand of the slide rule, there are big-brand products (safe, but expensive) and on the right hand there are innovative alternatives (buy whitebox and write your own OS)... but there are plenty of options in between. Branded whitebox comes to mind, like Big Switch, Nuage and others. You can take advantage of the cost savings, but you still have one source for both software and hardware. I suspect that the overhead of paying for the branded services will offset the in-house development costs and technical debt of grow-your-own. Grow-your-own is a gamble that you can do it successfully and that the ROI isn&#39;t going to drag out past 3 years. I&#39;m not criticizing the idea - if it fits your business model, then go for it. But if you can&#39;t tie that effort directly and clearly to your business strategy, then I&#39;d consider something with training wheels.<br /><br />CWB",

Tasks like this are more of less depends on the business side than technical. You do need technical expertise but there should be enough funds to support the work. In the long run, you have to justify that running cost of your own innovation will have major advantages in comparison to off-the-shelf technology. <br /><br />I guess, because of these factors, only companies with big R&amp;D budget can afford it.",

      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br />we&#39;re also a &quot;mid-sized European ISP&quot; and we do build our own network gear, although not L2 datacenter switches but edge L3 stuff. We instal them in thousands of remote POPs with no out-of-band management.<br /><br />We decided an overall SoC architecture and hired an OEM to assemble our custom hardware (at the moment 2*10G+24*1G and 8*10G) in a few thousands units. <br /><br />Of course we used &quot;standard building block&quot;, as you call them, e.g.: Quagga for OSPF, Exabgp, OpenVSwitch, lldpd, a custom PPPoX/L2TP damon, etc.<br /><br />We&#39;ve opted to do dataplane in a dpkd-like way over a great userspace stack we licensed from 6WIND (http://www.lightreading.com/carrier-sdn/sdn-technology/italian-sp-deploys-homemade-sdn-appliance/d/d-id/713802).<br /><br />Also, we build our own centralised network automation tool, scripting tools, a monitoring GUI and even defined our own &quot;cli&quot; with its own syntax.<br /><br />We&#39;ve got a rather meshed backbone, so we&#39;re using OpenFlow-rules to loadbalance MPLS customer traffic on all the available routes based on opportunistic traffic class determination and realtime link capacity (most of them are microwave, i.e., time-varying) though a Mixed Integer Programming algorithm that uses the libs of a general-purpose commercial solver to find the optimal routing strategy. On top of that, we proactively provision backup paths and use BFD for fast-reroute.<br /><br />For fun, we&#39;re rewriting part of that central controller on GPU (on a pair of Nvidia Telsa K2).<br /><br />All this with a staff of 3 people, over the last 1.5 years.<br /><br />If we were to start this adventure again, we would honestly do a number of things differently, but I think we would follow the same path.<br /><br />I completely agree with the &quot;lack of talent&quot; you talked about! Imho networking is still a software-adverse field: we find it extremely hard to find networking people that have a solid software mentality.<br /><br />If you&#39;d like more details for a chat, feel free to get in touch.<br />Giacomo Bernardi (mino@ngi.it)",
