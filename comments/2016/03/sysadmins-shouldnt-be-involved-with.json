However, the point here is that you should provide a way for developers to consume the network as a service.

      "html": "Running BGP on an application server has a lot of advantages and it&#39;s very easy to do. For example, you could achieve [legacy] application mobility by just configuring RFC1918 addresses between your ToR and your servers, assigning an application IP to a loopback interface and announcing it. You want to move the application to another rack/pod/dc? Just start announcing that IP address from another host. And the application guys don&#39;t even have to know that BGP is involved in there. That&#39;s what puppet classes are for. Just ask them to tag their host with the required class that will take care of the loopback interface and the BGP configuration and off you go ;)<br /><br />And don&#39;t forget other use cases like anycast services or routing to a hypervisor. Think how simple your network might turn out as you could get rid of overlay protocols and just use BGP to ensure end to end connectivity and app mobility. <br />",

As Ivan pointed out several years ago (http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/12/hyper-v-network-virtualization-wnvnvgre.html) Hyper-V Server 2012 is when Microsoft really started to tackle network virtualization and scalability issues. 2012 R2 added some much needed BGP features accessible via powershell..I believe OSPF support has also been removed, as it most likely was never really used. Server 2016 (nano) added even more nice features (https://technet.microsoft.com/en-ca/library/dn890699.aspx) namely access to a programmable network controller/switch, VXLAN support and software LB. I&#39;ve been running Hyper-V on production since 2008 release without any issues, I am really looking forward to the Hyper-V 2016 and beyond. I would still not want to sprawl any VM&#39;s across to another DC, same rules applies, keep the failure domains small, here is a nice write-up from Daniel&#39;s blog - https://danielhertzberg.wordpress.com/2015/10/11/333/<br />",

Not a very cost-effective architecture, but with some advantages...<br /><br />But my point was that host routing could be feasible for just a minority of endpoints that justify it. Just not for every server. So maybe a few hundreds or thousands, and little FIB scalability impact. It&#39;s not an all/nothing decission. Could be as small as 2/3 nodes of a backend cluster anycasting... Some dozens, etc...<br /><br />Regarding the original topic, edge BGP for service announcement on a host can be so standarized (also with as much security and protection as wanted at the network side) that the server team just doesn&#39;t have to touch the configurations further than configuring the loopback and interface addresses and the gateways, as they do today.",

      "html": "Running BGP on servers is feasible, but challenging at big scale. Moving from /24 subnets to /32 host routes is difficult for recent ToR switches with small FIBs, unless aggregating on a leaf pair (which kills awesome value add services such as distant Anycast RHI or Mobility DHCP+RHI). Fortunately, moving from ARP on a /24 connected subnet to hundreds of BGP peerings can be solved via intermediary Route Servers (IXP-like) specially if we are talking about virtualized environments, but /32 host routing is definitely an scalability limitation in large deployments.<br /><br />The real solution is always the same: solve the problems with simple networking at the application layer. Maybe leaving Server Route Injection for a small number of critical clusters that really benefit from Anycasting and Multihoming.<br /><br />P.S. The server/networking silos dilemma can be solved with some work on standardization of BGP server configurations. BIRD is well suited for that. The server team ends up just configuring host /32 addresses and gateways (BGP neighbors) in an standalone text file.",
