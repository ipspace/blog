    html: 'I think another measure should be added: the effect of the removal of the
      weakest link, on the overall network.<br />Or at a further (more complicated)
      level: the effect of its removal on other services (ie the dependencies on that
      system or service.)'

  html: Identifying the weakest link is like playing a game of whack a mole, when
    you think you have all your ducks in order another appliance, piece of software
    or other dependency is unknowingly introduced creating a possible SPOF.. that&#39;s
    why I find it&#39;s important to regularly review these questions with the right
    group of people (Management, Network, Servers, Storage teams, etc) I also agree
    that there are far more cheaper/affordable ways than jumping into the L2 DCI bandwagon.
    Many applications these days have their own replication/syncing technology built-in..
    for example in the Microsoft world SQL Server mirroring has been around since
    v2005, Exchange 2007 has started it&#39;s own mailbox replication as well.. all
    of these have only improved. If possible, I would try to at least virtualize as
    many workloads as possible to make it at least possible to replicate legacy workloads
    at a VM level using software like Veeam or other form of replication. I understand
    that there will always be some super lagacy equipment which would require a forklift
    upgrade - I can think if a legacy IVR system using Dialogic cards (can&#39;t virtualize)
    tied to a bunch of analog telco lines..
