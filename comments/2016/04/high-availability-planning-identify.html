            <div class="comment-content">Identifying the weakest link is like playing a game of whack a mole, when you think you have all your ducks in order another appliance, piece of software or other dependency is unknowingly introduced creating a possible SPOF.. that&#39;s why I find it&#39;s important to regularly review these questions with the right group of people (Management, Network, Servers, Storage teams, etc) I also agree that there are far more cheaper/affordable ways than jumping into the L2 DCI bandwagon. Many applications these days have their own replication/syncing technology built-in.. for example in the Microsoft world SQL Server mirroring has been around since v2005, Exchange 2007 has started it&#39;s own mailbox replication as well.. all of these have only improved. If possible, I would try to at least virtualize as many workloads as possible to make it at least possible to replicate legacy workloads at a VM level using software like Veeam or other form of replication. I understand that there will always be some super lagacy equipment which would require a forklift upgrade - I can think if a legacy IVR system using Dialogic cards (can&#39;t virtualize) tied to a bunch of analog telco lines..</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I think another measure should be added: the effect of the removal of the weakest link, on the overall network.<br />Or at a further (more complicated) level: the effect of its removal on other services (ie the dependencies on that system or service.)</div>
