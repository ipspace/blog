It is not used for the clients, since it requires much more CPU than UDP, and for millions of devices you might not want to pay extra money for this required capacity extension. Usually, it is good enough for a single client to call again if something went wrong. However, in the IMS core you need quick seamless failover, and this is delivered by SCTP. The API changes for the Telco vendors are no problems, since they own the source code and anyhow alwayzs recompile their products.<br />",

          "html": "I&#39;m not convinced that combining loopback addresses on the servers with with unnumbered physical interfaces is the best approach because it relies too much on the network. With this approach, the network will always forward the packets along the shortest path to the loopback address of the host. If the host is connected to two different switches for redundancy, then it means that only one link will be used. If the link fails, you&#39;ll have to wait for the IGP convergence (or worse iBGP if you put BGP on the hosts) to recover from the failure.<br /><br />A different but more powerful design is to use a loopback address on the host and regular IP addresses on the physical interfaces with Multipath TCP. The loopback address is used as a rendez-vous point to establish the initial subflow but Multipath TCP advertises the addresses of the physical interfaces and traffic automatically flows along them. If there is not enough bandwidth on one interface, Multipath TCP will use the second. If one link fails, Multipath TCP will recover within a rtt. I&#39;ve heard some people using this approach with CEPH servers and they seemed to be pretty happy with it. ",
