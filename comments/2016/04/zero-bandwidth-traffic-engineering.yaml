    html: Yes, the diagram in the original post is suboptimal. You could route the
      orange path across the other link.

    html: 'My take is that the markings on the links (eg: 50 - 50 on .102 -&gt; .106)
      are metrics, so the high-priority orange is only ever going to be setup along
      .102, .105, .107, .103<br /><br />Also - LSPs are uni-directional, so the resulting
      Green Path (3rd diagram) is actually correct - it will only count BW in one
      direction.'

  html: I don&#39;t get it, in the original post the &quot;resulting green path&quot;
    is as incompatible as the sought after &quot;best one&quot;. Well, may be the
    diagram and the text are wrong, and not all links are 10G (but for the .107 -
    .103). Also, I don&#39;t see why is not .102-.106-.107-.103 a better orange path.<br
    />BTW, this is all graph theory and litle networking :)
