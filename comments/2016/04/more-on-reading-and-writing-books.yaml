  html: 'Can you make any recommendations on what we should be reading now when it
    comes to networking books? I have read everything on the old and new CCDE reading
    lists and Russ White&#39;s newer books as well. I have also read all of your books.
    I am currently reading through Patterns of Network Architecture by John Day. '

  html: I am usually a passive listener, but your link to the troopers conference
    was so valuable that I had to break my silence. I chuckled so many times while
    watching the presentation and I think the approaches speaker mentioned is applicable
    in general and just not limited to Security. Thanks again for that link.

  html: I think you&#39;re also being too idealistic. <br />Most companies want people
    who fix problems (fast).. not who understand the problem.<br /><br />Also in order
    to save money, they prefer to hire fewer people with lower quality. This kills
    the motivation for people to learn and to understand the problems and just know
    the necessary stuff to get the job..<br /><br />It is also common to make technical
    decisions on management level, leaving the engineering with the question &quot;how
    do i configure it to make it work&quot;<br /><br />This all leads to many people
    relying on google to quickly fix the problems instead of spending time and reading
    books to understand it.

    html: 'I forgot to add, I am finding more often, especially with the rise of Software
      Defined &quot;X&quot; and separate control planes, that a solid Out Of Band
      network  is a MUST. You don&#39;t want that chicken and egg situation where
      your controllers are trapped inside of your data path. '

  html: 'I find gaining years of troubleshooting skills to add to your arsenal is
    worth just as much as learning the fundamentals of new or existing deployment
    changes. I like to approach troubleshooting using the OSI model, logs and wireshark
    are always your friend.. for Layer 7 application issues I like to keep a simple
    Word document which lists the error message and its solution..easy reference for
    future errors.. that document grows by the day. Layers 1-3 debug/warning messages
    aren&#39;t so simple to just document  in Word, this is where a good network diagram
    comes in handy to map out LACP/STP/IP links and paths. I will admit, I tend to
    gravitate to the raw config and show commands first. Either way, it&#39;s no fun
    when your network is down and your scrambling to get it back up and running. My
    last case was where I had a Bladecenter chassis go down due to a prolonged power
    outage.. as soon as power was restored, the &quot;active&quot; LACP trunks would
    not come up due to STP blocking issues. Luckily we had all of our more critical
    stuff on another chassis. Sometimes, if you can, you can try to simplify the configuration
    a little more to narrow down to root cause. '
