I have read everything on the old and new CCDE reading lists and Russ White&#39;s newer books as well. I have also read all of your books. I am currently reading through Patterns of Network Architecture by John Day. ",

I chuckled so many times while watching the presentation and I think the approaches speaker mentioned is applicable in general and just not limited to Security. Thanks again for that link.",

      "html": "I think you&#39;re also being too idealistic. <br />Most companies want people who fix problems (fast).. not who understand the problem.<br /><br />Also in order to save money, they prefer to hire fewer people with lower quality. This kills the motivation for people to learn and to understand the problems and just know the necessary stuff to get the job..<br /><br />It is also common to make technical decisions on management level, leaving the engineering with the question &quot;how do i configure it to make it work&quot;<br /><br />This all leads to many people relying on google to quickly fix the problems instead of spending time and reading books to understand it.",

      "html": "I find gaining years of troubleshooting skills to add to your arsenal is worth just as much as learning the fundamentals of new or existing deployment changes. I like to approach troubleshooting using the OSI model, logs and wireshark are always your friend.. for Layer 7 application issues I like to keep a simple Word document which lists the error message and its solution..easy reference for future errors.. that document grows by the day. Layers 1-3 debug/warning messages aren&#39;t so simple to just document  in Word, this is where a good network diagram comes in handy to map out LACP/STP/IP links and paths. I will admit, I tend to gravitate to the raw config and show commands first. Either way, it&#39;s no fun when your network is down and your scrambling to get it back up and running. My last case was where I had a Bladecenter chassis go down due to a prolonged power outage.. as soon as power was restored, the &quot;active&quot; LACP trunks would not come up due to STP blocking issues. Luckily we had all of our more critical stuff on another chassis. Sometimes, if you can, you can try to simplify the configuration a little more to narrow down to root cause. ",
