    html: Hi Rob,<br /><br />Thanks for an extensive comment. We&#39;re in perfect
      agreement apart from &quot;other vendors doing the same&quot; part. <br /><br
      />I&#39;ve only seen control-plane policing of OpenFlow traffic documented in
      Cisco IOS and NEC ProgrammableFlow (of course I might have missed something).<br
      /><br />Best,<br />Ivan

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Happy to sit down with you (are you at Interop?) and chat
    about this in person but I think there&#39;s a few things worth clarifying here:<br
    /><br />1) Dataplane to control plane policing is something that all switches
    and routers (not just OpenFlow switches and controllers) have to deal with.  This
    is one of the reasons why all well-implemented switches rate limit all data plane
    traffic that can cause load on the control plane (e.g., ICMP, IP options, routing
    protocol traffic, STP control traffic, etc.).  Most folks have war stories of
    &quot;they sent a lot of X traffic and then the supervisor CPU went to 100% and
    everything stopped responding&quot;.  Mine was with packets with the IP Record
    Route option set :-)  Fortunately, modern hardware is quite good at this and has
    lots and lots of knobs to tune to exactly which traffic classes should have which
    priorities and rate limits.<br /><br />2) The bottleneck is in practice actually
    between ASIC and local switch CPU, not between switch CPU and OpenFlow controller.  In
    theory one could try to optimize this system for higher performance, but as you
    correctly call out, with the appropriate control plane policing, high data rates
    from data to control plane actually not needed.<br /><br />3) Given the above
    two points, I&#39;m fairly sure that all vendors of networking gear have some
    level of data &lt;--&gt; control plane policing.  Big Switch definitely implements
    this and certainly spends a lot of time thinking about correct policing behavior
    and testing to verify robustness here -- I can only imagine other vendors do the
    same.<br /><br />Hope this helps clear things up a bit -- happy to talk more in
    person.<br /><br />- Rob<br />.

  html: Please, look at ONOS. It can distribute the load between multiple instances
    of the same controller cluster. It can also provide full consistency for certain
    information subsets, nut just eventual consistency since it uses a modified CopyCat
    implentation of the RAFT algorithm.<br />However, this means that you should have
    minimum 3 cluster members.<br />This architecture is extremely similar to the
    Cisco Grapevine platform used in APIC-EM. I have the suspicion that Grapevine
    also uses the RAFT algorithm (or PAXOS) for full consistency.<br /><br />
