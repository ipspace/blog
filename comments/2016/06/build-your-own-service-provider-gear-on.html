            <div class="comment-content">Excellent podcast Ivan! It just goes to show, if there is a will there is a way - there were many obstacles Giacomo and his team had to go through, but with determination it shows that it is possible to build a (rather unique) network the right way - even while no off the shelf solutions existed in this case. And for the record, I hear you are often very critical when it comes to vendor network &quot;solutions&quot; or kludges as you mention many times in your blog posts. I must say, this is probably one of the first times I&#39;ve heard you commend such a great effort and design placed by this particular ISP. You gave credit to where it&#39;s due :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">(I thought I had posted this earlier, apparently my submit did not work?)<br /><br />This was quite an episode, and this infrastructure sounds comparable to the much larger &quot;SDN&quot; stuff we hear about (Google B4, LinkedIn, etc). Mind boggling that you manage to build all this on a small team and limited time.<br /><br />Thanks Ivan for recording it, congratulations to Giacomo and his team for the good work. <br />Dan.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">What an inspiration! I wholeheartedly agree with Ivan - a product/open source release of what Giacomo and his team managed to build and iterate upon has truly enormous implications for the industry. </div>
