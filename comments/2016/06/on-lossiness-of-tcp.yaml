  html: 'Very nice response. When I read the original article I was scratching my
    head as well. I guess the original author chose a wrong word - lossy. <br />Maybe
    his intention was to describe the fact that almost  any normal TCP stream has
    certain amount of drops and retransmisions. We all have been on many troubleshooting
    calls, trying to explain this little fact to everybody...<br /><br /><br />P.s.
    The picture that describes the throughput is also weird, every oscilation should
    be smaller and smaller... '

  html: It is a pretty poorly written article.  i rarely see loss on a telnet or ssh
    sessions (not running a vpn or file transfer inside), but since most people just
    look at tcp sessions running large web downloads or file transfers, they see congestion
    caused loss as the norm i guess.<br /><br />The title of the post seems like it
    would be right at home in the &quot;National Inquirer&quot;, which is a gossip
    rag here in the US.

  html: And just for clarity, i did NOT mean your article, I meant the one that you
    are responding too above.

  html: Yeah, it&#39;s poorly worded. &quot;TCP is designed to operate on a lossy
    network, and uses loss as a signal to slow down&quot; might be better.

  html: I thought the last part - that &quot;nobody cares&quot; - was the biggest
    howler of all.  What rock has the author been hiding under?

      do Skype over the Internet doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s wrong.
