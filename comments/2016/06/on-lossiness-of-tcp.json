      "html": "Very nice response. When I read the original article I was scratching my head as well. I guess the original author chose a wrong word - lossy. <br />Maybe his intention was to describe the fact that almost  any normal TCP stream has certain amount of drops and retransmisions. We all have been on many troubleshooting calls, trying to explain this little fact to everybody...<br /><br /><br />P.s. The picture that describes the throughput is also weird, every oscilation should be smaller and smaller... ",
