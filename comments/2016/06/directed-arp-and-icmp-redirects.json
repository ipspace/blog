Brocade has interpreted the RFC to indicate that if a packets arrives and leaves the same physical interface a redirect should be sent, ignoring if they are different vlans, ve&#39;s, logical interfaces, etc.  It&#39;s not something needed or wanted in modern networks.

If the router the PC is using has it off subnet destinations links down the router send icmp redirect pc to go to  other router for the off subnet destination.   <br /><br />I remember early day clients with 2 routers on same subnet and their primary off subnet destination would be on one and another off subnet service on the other router and in the traces you would see all the redirect traffic for each respective session redirected between routers, extra traffic and usually fixed with FHRP or destination parity on both routers.  but this is a good case of icmp protocol doing its job.",

RFC1122 also requires hosts to discard redirects sourced from something other than the default router. In this case (interface with secondary addresses configured), how is the router able to determine which IP address should be stamped on the redirect source IP field? HSRP/VRRP handle this by keeping track of which MAC address the objectionalbe (mis-routed) frame was destined for. How does it work in this case?<br /><br />Some digging I once did in this area: http://www.fragmentationneeded.net/2011/06/to-redirect-or-not-to-redirect-that-is.html",
