            <div class="comment-content">Pushing controller to end-host also can be done for routing. BGP for example, host will have the control to advertise the UP network required and &#39;take over&#39; the complexity from the network.<br /><br />However, it doesn&#39;t mean that the plumbing in the middle does not require BGP let alone routing protocol.<br /><br />In this case, end-host is participating but not actually taking over.<br /><br />I cannot find real-life example (probably I haven&#39;t live that long) on how multicast control can be pushed to end-host. Session control/record is required on each hop.<br /><br />Idea is good, you both are futurist.</div>

We have group communication 1 to many and it seems that multicasts are very efficient for this kind of network.

            <div class="comment-content">The mantra that the multicasts are dead and not useful is repeated in this &quot;Future of the Networking&quot; series many times. I guess that all guests (Comer, Huston) think about Internet. The Enterprise networking is somewhat different story and there are many niches where we do things differently to be efficient. They often mention CDN as the ultimate solution which kills the multicasts. Again, what works fine for the Internet (from the cost perspective) is not always good for non Internet networks</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Even with video streams, it&#39;s far easier and more reliable to setup an internal CDN which sends unicast streams to caching/re-broadcasting appliances closer to the end-users than it is to keep a multicast network working reliably. Setting up multicast routing isn&#39;t difficult, but troubleshooting a multicast network issue is a nightmare. Can you setup a debug on a production router in the middle of a production day? Can you get a packet-capture? How often can you upgrade router firmware to get in patches for buggy multicast routing?<br /><br />At a small scale (100 Mbps links, Cisco ISR routers) I&#39;m sure multicast works fine. At a large scale (10Gbps links, Cisco 6500/7600 routers), where multicast should be the most beneficial, multicast is a troubleshooting nightmare.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Sounds like FUD to me.  We do both CDN and IP multicast for different applications.  We have been doing IP multicast video distribution for many years.  It&#39;s not rocket science, it hasn&#39;t changed much in a decade, and it&#39;s not really that hard to troubleshoot.  We use it where it makes sense to use it, and much higher speeds than 10Gbps.  BIER is even new work going on to create a stateless multicast delivery method, so it&#39;s certainly not dead.  <br /><br />As for QoS, even in long-haul networks there can be bottlenecks requiring QoS.  There is also a movement towards more agile optical restoration to replace L3 capacity in long-haul/metro networks.  During the restoration events you need QoS in order to keep higher priority traffic flowing while best effort traffic is dropped.  <br /><br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">Good point Phil. Even at 10gig there&#39;s room to utilize QoS. Until the day when everyone will have all the bandwidth they&#39;d ever need, QoS will be needed to prioritize traffic.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Multicast won&#39;t die, at least for a while, but for sure its role in the networking world will diminish. <br /><br />On the DC side, for applications that are high volume and require efficient delivery, multicast will still play a key role. Perfect example is high volume market data distribution. On the WAN side, the use cases are mainly for video streaming (e.g. IPTV), broadcast, or applications that require fair delivery to recipients. <br /><br />More and more applications are now relying on unicast delivery and doing multicast in a much localized fashion. Between the application layer and the network layer, it&#39;s getting more common to have a transport layer which is responsible for delivering data to the end points. This layer running in the servers can provide more flexibility and customization of data delivery. And that could also simply be a message bus in a pub-sub fashion.<br /><br />Multicast has always been difficult to conquer. If you are involved, for example, in deploying multicast to MPLS WAN, then you should remember the fun debate related to NG-MVPN, mLDP VS RSVP-TE, etc. Why bothers if you don&#39;t have to? While multicast won&#39;t die, its future is dim. And this is not necessary a bad thing.</div>
