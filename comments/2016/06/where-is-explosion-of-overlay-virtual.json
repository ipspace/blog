      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />This is true that virtualization teams don&#39;t want an another heap of complexity. It is much harder to these teams learn networking than networking teams virtualization. That&#39;s why overlay networking is mainly for networking teams or merged teams where network guys are operating.<br /><br />In terms of the NSX price it is easier to justify on the CAPEX level where we compare a price of an East-West firewall or a L7 load-balancer.<br /><br />",

      "html": "If you measure by how many companies *use* an overlay, the numbers are quite impressive, and growing fast. The public cloud gives each customer an overlay to use, such as AWS VPC.  Sure, not many companies have *built* an overlay, but why does that matter when in fact they are using one. Overlays are awesome, like a jet airplane. It makes more sense to just use them and leave the building part to the experts.",
