  html: Excellent podcast Ivan! It just goes to show, if there is a will there is
    a way - there were many obstacles Giacomo and his team had to go through, but
    with determination it shows that it is possible to build a (rather unique) network
    the right way - even while no off the shelf solutions existed in this case. And
    for the record, I hear you are often very critical when it comes to vendor network
    &quot;solutions&quot; or kludges as you mention many times in your blog posts.
    I must say, this is probably one of the first times I&#39;ve heard you commend
    such a great effort and design placed by this particular ISP. You gave credit
    to where it&#39;s due :)

  html: (I thought I had posted this earlier, apparently my submit did not work?)<br
    /><br />This was quite an episode, and this infrastructure sounds comparable to
    the much larger &quot;SDN&quot; stuff we hear about (Google B4, LinkedIn, etc).
    Mind boggling that you manage to build all this on a small team and limited time.<br
    /><br />Thanks Ivan for recording it, congratulations to Giacomo and his team
    for the good work. <br />Dan.

  html: 'What an inspiration! I wholeheartedly agree with Ivan - a product/open source
    release of what Giacomo and his team managed to build and iterate upon has truly
    enormous implications for the industry. '
