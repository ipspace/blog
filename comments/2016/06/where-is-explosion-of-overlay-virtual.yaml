  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />This is true that virtualization teams don&#39;t want
    an another heap of complexity. It is much harder to these teams learn networking
    than networking teams virtualization. That&#39;s why overlay networking is mainly
    for networking teams or merged teams where network guys are operating.<br /><br
    />In terms of the NSX price it is easier to justify on the CAPEX level where we
    compare a price of an East-West firewall or a L7 load-balancer.<br /><br />

  html: If you measure by how many companies *use* an overlay, the numbers are quite
    impressive, and growing fast. The public cloud gives each customer an overlay
    to use, such as AWS VPC.  Sure, not many companies have *built* an overlay, but
    why does that matter when in fact they are using one. Overlays are awesome, like
    a jet airplane. It makes more sense to just use them and leave the building part
    to the experts.

    html: Haven&#39;t heard anything along these lines. They have their own solution
      and seem to be pretty happy with it ;) But then, getting VMware to interoperate
      with anyone else wasn&#39;t ever easy, right?
