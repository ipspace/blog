Setting up multicast routing isn&#39;t difficult, but troubleshooting a multicast network issue is a nightmare. Can you setup a debug on a production router in the middle of a production day? Can you get a packet-capture? How often can you upgrade router firmware to get in patches for buggy multicast routing?<br /><br />At a small scale (100 Mbps links, Cisco ISR routers) I&#39;m sure multicast works fine. At a large scale (10Gbps links, Cisco 6500/7600 routers), where multicast should be the most beneficial, multicast is a troubleshooting nightmare.",

It&#39;s not rocket science, it hasn&#39;t changed much in a decade, and it&#39;s not really that hard to troubleshoot.  We use it where it makes sense to use it, and much higher speeds than 10Gbps.  BIER is even new work going on to create a stateless multicast delivery method, so it&#39;s certainly not dead.  <br /><br />As for QoS, even in long-haul networks there can be bottlenecks requiring QoS.  There is also a movement towards more agile optical restoration to replace L3 capacity in long-haul/metro networks.  During the restoration events you need QoS in order to keep higher priority traffic flowing while best effort traffic is dropped.  <br /><br />",

      "html": "Multicast won&#39;t die, at least for a while, but for sure its role in the networking world will diminish. <br /><br />On the DC side, for applications that are high volume and require efficient delivery, multicast will still play a key role. Perfect example is high volume market data distribution. On the WAN side, the use cases are mainly for video streaming (e.g. IPTV), broadcast, or applications that require fair delivery to recipients. <br /><br />More and more applications are now relying on unicast delivery and doing multicast in a much localized fashion. Between the application layer and the network layer, it&#39;s getting more common to have a transport layer which is responsible for delivering data to the end points. This layer running in the servers can provide more flexibility and customization of data delivery. And that could also simply be a message bus in a pub-sub fashion.<br /><br />Multicast has always been difficult to conquer. If you are involved, for example, in deploying multicast to MPLS WAN, then you should remember the fun debate related to NG-MVPN, mLDP VS RSVP-TE, etc. Why bothers if you don&#39;t have to? While multicast won&#39;t die, its future is dim. And this is not necessary a bad thing.",
