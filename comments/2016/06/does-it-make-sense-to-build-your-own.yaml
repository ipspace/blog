    html: 'Counter-example? I think the guys at Eolo have confirmed the points I raised.
      Look at barefoot networks for another example of a technology that is most likely
      going to be disruptive to the existing vendors business model. Barefoot didn&#39;t
      need an army of engineers to develop a re- programmable ASIC. Most importantly
      if this development is what they claim it is, then it could very well abstract
      the hardware level entirely. Developing your own boxes with line rate performance
      will become increasingly easier. '

    html: '@Peppe: you might have noticed that the guys at Eolo deployed over a thousand
      boxes. Also, I did a podcast with Russ White and he mentioned deploying your
      own software at DC switches starts making sense at around 50K ports.<br /><br
      />Also, I never claimed OpEx will be &quot;systematically higher&quot;, I just
      said most people have no idea what it will be.<br /><br />As for Barefoot Networks
      - so far it&#39;s still vaporware (= technical whitepaper), and programmable
      ASICs (= NPUs) have been around for ages... they just tend to be more expensive
      than stripped-down versions with fixed pipeline.'

    html: "Hi Ivan. Big fan of your blog and particularly your rants. :)<br /><br\
      \ />Eolo is a medium size SP. No one is suggesting to build your own network\
      \ gear for SMEs but large enterprises and SPs can, IMO. Eolo may have deployed\
      \ over a thousand boxes but I am pretty sure they developed their solution only\
      \ on a handful of them. Anyone up to the challenge can ask OEMs to develop hardware\
      \ at given specs for a fraction of those 1000 boxes. 30-50 units is perhaps\
      \ a sufficiently large order for an OEM and certainly not a mind boggling one\
      \ for most SPs to afford. <br /><br />SDN and network hardware abstraction is\
      \ beyond DC applications. We should not deter anyone from building their own\
      \ network gear for whatever application they see fit. Some smart folks in silicon\
      \ valley understood that a while ago and now run pretty successful businesses\
      \ (acquired or as vendors). Building your own gear is not for everyone, but\
      \ some engineers with the right skills can do it. Eventually Eolo will be just\
      \ one of the many examples instead of being the exception. I am confident there\
      \ will be more and more guests at your podcasts talking about their ideas.<br\
      \ /><br />Barefoot Networks is a little special. The founder is Nick McKeown.\
      \ He is a Stanford professor, one of the founders of Nicira and arguably one\
      \ of the fathers of SDN (together with Scott Shenker and Martin Casado). Nicira\
      \ was no vaporware as we all know. <br /><br />Silicon Valley is surely home\
      \ of a lot of vaporware these days, but that\xB4s not to say it is all vapour.\
      \ Time will tell. Let\xB4s wait a few more months to see what Barefoot\xB4s\
      \ ASIC is really made of (ASIC-like performance/cost of NPU-like performance/cost).\
      \ I cross my fingers and hope for some serious innovation. Their use of the\
      \ P4 language certainly made me curious."

    html: 'I have found something more concrete about Barefoot Networks which I think
      everyone will be interested to learn about. When it comes to Barefoot, a lot
      more info can be found by looking at academic/research papers, which is what
      I believe they are building something upon.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s10XP8qdZ34<br
      />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUv43w7ZQCM<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abXezfJsqso<br
      /><br />Nick McKeown mentioned that Barefoot Networks is working on a flexible-function
      ASIC. Traditionally ASICs were custom developed according to specific functions
      (match + action, e.g. match specific header field and replace it). If I understood
      it correctly, Nick is suggesting to perform pipeline insertion &amp; manipulation
      in a a way that is protocol independent (i.e. arbitrary bit by bit manipulation
      instead of protocol hierarchy-specific pipelines). Also a significant amount
      of complexity in ASIC development comes from microcode programming, which Nick
      seems to suggest we can all forget about. Protocol Independent Forwarding and
      higher level (abstraction) level languages like P4 will be used to code pipelines
      in an abstracted (and easier) manner. <br /><br />Nick also makes some excellent
      points:<br />a) The vast majority of source code to run network functions is
      open source and most modern Network Operating Systems run on Linux.<br />b)
      Performance ratio of ASIC:NPU:CPU=100:10:1<br />c) all sort of new applications
      at 100G line rate per port could be enabled.<br />d) Software will eat the world
      (Marc Andreessen).<br />e) network vendors have been hindering technology development
      for years and a lot of things will change in our industry if the network hardware
      layer is fully abstracted. Google, FB, Spotify and others companies with competent
      technology-focused leadership have understood that a long time ago.<br /><br
      />Of course price-performance ratio will be the key aspect but I think Barefoot
      is going to surprise everyone. '

      on a handful of them.<br /><br />No, virtually *all* their radio towers host
      one of those SDN boxes discussed in the podcast. It&#39;s cheaper and simpler
      to have a homogeneous network. Multiple thousands of these boxes have already
      been built and deployed.<br /><br />I agree with point d) above. Also, I&#39;d
      add: <br />f) Do not aim for line-rate all the time. This and realistic traffic
      patterns on moderately multiplexed traffic allows you to use CPU-only processing.
      This is exactly what we did in that Eolo project.<br /><br />Giacomo'

    html: '@Giacomo. First and foremost, thank you so much for sharing your work and
      your ideas. This is true open source spirit and I look forward to see the details
      of your work once they are published.<br /><br />Previously I wrote that Eolo
      deployed over a thousand boxes but only developed on a handful of them. This
      bit may have been misunderstood. I used the word developed referring to development
      stage after design/research (R&amp;D). I would expect you first made a small
      order from the OEM and tested the solution for a while before going into full
      blown deployment and ordering over a thousand of units. The point I was trying
      to make is that one does not need to order 1000 units to get an OEM to build
      something based on custom specs. Or in other words, smaller companies than Eolo
      could well try to build their own gear too. Even better if your reference design
      is published. <br /><br />Unfortunately line rate performance is used by vendors
      to set themselves on a different league and sadly, many (if not most) customer
      decision makers can only compare boxes by datasheet/marketing numbers instead
      of their actual use/need. Fair enough, if line rate performance is what one
      is after (surely DCs and Carrier Networks are) then an ASIC is the only way
      to deliver Tbps worth of processing power. Custom and expensive ASIC designs
      were blamed for high development costs and that reason is likely to disappear
      once barefoot releases what I think they are planning to. <br /><br />I fully
      agree with you that CPU-based solutions can fit most use cases and barefoot
      is not going to change that. However barefoot may add to it by enabling something
      quite new and extraordinary. An ASIC could be flexibly programmed by a controller
      to perform all sort of advanced tasks even at the edge or even access layer
      (e.g. DPI as NG-FWs and DDoS detection &amp; filtering) and I don&#39;t technically
      need a vendor to code that if an open source community sets on the task to write
      that code for everyone (see OpenStack as example). <br /><br />More clues on
      this 2014 paper published by Stanford in collaboration with Barefoot Networks,
      Google, Intel, Microsoft and Princeton University:<br />http://www.sigcomm.org/sites/default/files/ccr/papers/2014/July/0000000-0000004.pdf'

  html: 'Everything is possible provided the right skills and leadership are available.
    Recipe:<br />a) a few engineers who know exactly what they are doing.<br />b)
    management who understands (and support) the problems the engineers are trying
    to solve + shield them from politics.<br />c) A and B usually never come together.
    When they do, the result is  companies like Google, FB, etc.<br /><br />I don&#39;t
    think anyone can say OpEx will be systematically higher until someone actually
    does it. So far everyone is just too scared to even try. '

  html: Peppe, I agree with Ivan&#39;s article and I definitely agree with your comment.
    Item &quot;b&quot; strikes home. When your leadership says that budget is tight
    and we need to deliver XYZ, I read this as an opportunity to innovate. When the
    same leadership makes comments like &quot;Who is Big Switch?&quot; or &quot;What
    is whitebox?&quot; or &quot;Dell makes switches?&quot;, my innovation spark fizzles.
    Better to line up with the &quot;never get fired for buying X&quot; crowd. I have
    found it very difficult to open hearts and minds in leadership... when they hear
    &quot;innovation&quot; they translate that as &quot;risky nightmare&quot;. To
    be fair, it can be.<br /><br />I have worked briefly with some &quot;visionary&quot;
    leadership over the years and they were not only open minded, they were informed
    and looking at some innovative solutions on their own. It was refreshing, but
    short-lived.
