Look at barefoot networks for another example of a technology that is most likely going to be disruptive to the existing vendors business model. Barefoot didn&#39;t need an army of engineers to develop a re- programmable ASIC. Most importantly if this development is what they claim it is, then it could very well abstract the hardware level entirely. Developing your own boxes with line rate performance will become increasingly easier. ",

No one is suggesting to build your own network gear for SMEs but large enterprises and SPs can, IMO. Eolo may have deployed over a thousand boxes but I am pretty sure they developed their solution only on a handful of them. Anyone up to the challenge can ask OEMs to develop hardware at given specs for a fraction of those 1000 boxes. 30-50 units is perhaps a sufficiently large order for an OEM and certainly not a mind boggling one for most SPs to afford. <br /><br />SDN and network hardware abstraction is beyond DC applications. We should not deter anyone from building their own network gear for whatever application they see fit. Some smart folks in silicon valley understood that a while ago and now run pretty successful businesses (acquired or as vendors). Building your own gear is not for everyone, but some engineers with the right skills can do it. Eventually Eolo will be just one of the many examples instead of being the exception. I am confident there will be more and more guests at your podcasts talking about their ideas.<br /><br />Barefoot Networks is a little special. The founder is Nick McKeown. He is a Stanford professor, one of the founders of Nicira and arguably one of the fathers of SDN (together with Scott Shenker and Martin Casado). Nicira was no vaporware as we all know. <br /><br />Silicon Valley is surely home of a lot of vaporware these days, but that\u00b4s not to say it is all vapour. Time will tell. Let\u00b4s wait a few more months to see what Barefoot\u00b4s ASIC is really made of (ASIC-like performance/cost of NPU-like performance/cost). I cross my fingers and hope for some serious innovation. Their use of the P4 language certainly made me curious.",

          "html": "I have found something more concrete about Barefoot Networks which I think everyone will be interested to learn about. When it comes to Barefoot, a lot more info can be found by looking at academic/research papers, which is what I believe they are building something upon.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s10XP8qdZ34<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUv43w7ZQCM<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abXezfJsqso<br /><br />Nick McKeown mentioned that Barefoot Networks is working on a flexible-function ASIC. Traditionally ASICs were custom developed according to specific functions (match + action, e.g. match specific header field and replace it). If I understood it correctly, Nick is suggesting to perform pipeline insertion &amp; manipulation in a a way that is protocol independent (i.e. arbitrary bit by bit manipulation instead of protocol hierarchy-specific pipelines). Also a significant amount of complexity in ASIC development comes from microcode programming, which Nick seems to suggest we can all forget about. Protocol Independent Forwarding and higher level (abstraction) level languages like P4 will be used to code pipelines in an abstracted (and easier) manner. <br /><br />Nick also makes some excellent points:<br />a) The vast majority of source code to run network functions is open source and most modern Network Operating Systems run on Linux.<br />b) Performance ratio of ASIC:NPU:CPU=100:10:1<br />c) all sort of new applications at 100G line rate per port could be enabled.<br />d) Software will eat the world (Marc Andreessen).<br />e) network vendors have been hindering technology development for years and a lot of things will change in our industry if the network hardware layer is fully abstracted. Google, FB, Spotify and others companies with competent technology-focused leadership have understood that a long time ago.<br /><br />Of course price-performance ratio will be the key aspect but I think Barefoot is going to surprise everyone.

It&#39;s cheaper and simpler to have a homogeneous network. Multiple thousands of these boxes have already been built and deployed.<br /><br />I agree with point d) above. Also, I&#39;d add: <br />f) Do not aim for line-rate all the time. This and realistic traffic patterns on moderately multiplexed traffic allows you to use CPU-only processing.

          "html": "@Giacomo. First and foremost, thank you so much for sharing your work and your ideas. This is true open source spirit and I look forward to see the details of your work once they are published.<br /><br />Previously I wrote that Eolo deployed over a thousand boxes but only developed on a handful of them. This bit may have been misunderstood. I used the word developed referring to development stage after design/research (R&amp;D). I would expect you first made a small order from the OEM and tested the solution for a while before going into full blown deployment and ordering over a thousand of units. The point I was trying to make is that one does not need to order 1000 units to get an OEM to build something based on custom specs. Or in other words, smaller companies than Eolo could well try to build their own gear too. Even better if your reference design is published. <br /><br />Unfortunately line rate performance is used by vendors to set themselves on a different league and sadly, many (if not most) customer decision makers can only compare boxes by datasheet/marketing numbers instead of their actual use/need. Fair enough, if line rate performance is what one is after (surely DCs and Carrier Networks are) then an ASIC is the only way to deliver Tbps worth of processing power. Custom and expensive ASIC designs were blamed for high development costs and that reason is likely to disappear once barefoot releases what I think they are planning to. <br /><br />I fully agree with you that CPU-based solutions can fit most use cases and barefoot is not going to change that. However barefoot may add to it by enabling something quite new and extraordinary. An ASIC could be flexibly programmed by a controller to perform all sort of advanced tasks even at the edge or even access layer (e.g. DPI as NG-FWs and DDoS detection &amp; filtering) and I don&#39;t technically need a vendor to code that if an open source community sets on the task to write that code for everyone (see OpenStack as example). <br /><br />More clues on this 2014 paper published by Stanford in collaboration with Barefoot Networks, Google, Intel, Microsoft and Princeton University:<br />http://www.sigcomm.org/sites/default/files/ccr/papers/2014/July/0000000-0000004.pdf",

When your leadership says that budget is tight and we need to deliver XYZ, I read this as an opportunity to innovate. When the same leadership makes comments like &quot;Who is Big Switch?&quot; or &quot;What is whitebox?&quot; or &quot;Dell makes switches?&quot;, my innovation spark fizzles. Better to line up with the &quot;never get fired for buying X&quot; crowd. I have found it very difficult to open hearts and minds in leadership... when they hear &quot;innovation&quot; they translate that as &quot;risky nightmare&quot;. To be fair, it can be.<br /><br />I have worked briefly with some &quot;visionary&quot; leadership over the years and they were not only open minded, they were informed and looking at some innovative solutions on their own. It was refreshing, but short-lived.",
