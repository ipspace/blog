    html: Dear Anonymous,<br /><br />As you don&#39;t have the chutzpah to use your
      real name (or at least a long-term alias) I won&#39;t even start arguing the
      technical points with you.<br /><br />Anyway, let me reiterate:<br /><br />A)
      no major vendor is significantly better or worse than others;<br />B) Ethernet
      fabrics and SDN are as messed up as any other networking technology if not more.<br
      /><br />As for who&#39;s paying my bills, you couldn&#39;t be more wrong. And
      who&#39;s paying yours?

  html: The author does have many good points and your counter points aren&#39;t that
    strong. You missed out in Cisco hardware lock in for most of their solutions.
    What about ripping 5ks for 9ks? Proprietary protocols like EIGRP and VTP? Every
    vendor is going to have some form of secret sauce of proprietary but Cisco just
    takes it to the next level. And seeing how you use Cisco to pay your bills I can
    see your bias.

    html: "In summary: &quot;why Cisco can get away with this better than $vendor?\u201D\
      \ ;))<br /><br />Because they consistently invested in building mindshare for\
      \ the last 25 years:<br /><br />* Publicly available documentation and release\
      \ notes;<br />* Design guides and technical whitepapers that are more than blatant\
      \ self-promotion;<br />* Reasonably-good training (don&#39;t get me started\

      \ with high-quality presentations;<br />* Conference presentations and videos\
      \ being publicly available<br />* ...<br /><br />If you do that just 5% better\
      \ than the average, the compound effect over 25 years reaches 240% (1.05^25-1).\
      \ I&#39;d say that Cisco (overall) is way more than 5% better than average.<br\

    html: Btw. webscale companys still buy from Cisco.<br /><br />Apple just bought
      something like 5000x NCS5500 ....  Web scale companys just care about uptime
      and capex and put their own software on it.

  html: I understand the frustration of the person who wrote the article. In my work
    experience, I have faced the challenge of the 800 lb gorilla to one degree or
    another. I have provided solution options based on requirements for large and
    small efforts and I am baffled by how often Cisco is selected despite the fact
    that they are clearly the most expensive, sometimes by a large margin. When I
    ask why, they essentially quote the &quot;never get fired for buying Cisco&quot;
    line. I even had one VP shrug and say that he&#39;s never even heard of the other
    vendors (he doesn&#39;t follow the industry). So, gripe about their technology,
    their approach, the complexity... it doesn&#39;t matter. It doesn&#39;t even matter
    if you have a legitimately better/cheaper/faster product. Cisco has successfully
    waged their marketing/culture/perception campaign and THAT is where your challenges
    lie. If you can&#39;t counter this, then best of luck to you. Arista and others
    have successfully nibbled at this in carrier/cloud/trading markets, but not so
    much in enterprise markets.<br /><br />On a positive note, with more and more
    webscale companies going white box (or branded whitebox) and writing their own
    OS, I&#39;m at least seeing more decision-makers asking &quot;why&quot;, and that
    is the first step. Revolutions begin like this...

    html: I would say that what you&#39;ve seen in your crystal ball has already happened
      at large cloud providers/web properties and is slowly trickling down toward
      the mass adoption.<br /><br />However, I doubt we&#39;ll see any significant
      change in the way networking works (there are only so many ways to solve a problem
      given external constraints) as long as we have to keep at least the socket API
      intact. Would love to be surprised but remain skeptical...

    html: Good catch.  I was trying to make the point that moving packets between
      two endpoints (two sockets interfaces seen by application components) in a data
      center is a lot simpler than what NICs and switches do today.  <br /><br />Google
      has the resources to reinvent that complexity, while my hypothetical graduate
      students simply cannot.<br /><br />For example, imagine a data center plumbed
      with Sockets Direct Protocol, using Calico-like microsegmentation, and using
      a DNS-like service to find endpoints (sockets).  The application wouldn&#39;t
      care whether the underlay was good old Ethernet, ACI, InfiniBand, Omni-Path,
      or whatever gets invented next.<br /><br />And yes, you are right about the
      external constraints.  A Google data center has millions of north/south connections
      to the outside world (and that&#39;s just to serve the ads) as well as inter-data-center
      traffic.  The place where &quot;dumb and simple&quot; inside the data center
      meets &quot;real networking&quot; at the data center edge is challenging, but
      doable, as InfiniBand has shown.<br /><br />Will be interesting to watch over
      the next 20 years and see how this plays out.<br /><br />-steve

  html: 'First, want to be extraordinarily clear that what I say here is my own opinion,
    and is not the position of my employer (which happens to be Hewlett Packard Enterprise).<br
    /><br />Observation: HPE did create a very simple network edge in Virtual Connect,
    which has been on the market for almost a decade.  Being simple meant it was in
    a server paradigm and not a network paradigm.  This works for some people and
    not for others.<br /><br />Crystal ball (at which my track record is mixed): I
    believe that in some university somewhere in the world, a couple of graduate students
    will be trying to integrate data center networking into yet another Ansible/Puppet/Chef
    type application deployment framework, will get frustrated trying to deal with
    networking as we know it, and will write a little shim that runs over the Broadcom
    SDK (or one of its competitors) which solves their problem deploying and running
    applications (is a good enough underlay for Calico, for example).  They&#39;ll
    use white box switches because there were a few sitting around (they were cheap).  This
    software will turn out to be generally useful in Ethernet-backbone supercomputers
    and in an interesting subset of data centers.  It is not networking as we know
    it.  Bridging this to the real network is an &quot;interesting&quot; problem,
    with precedents in InfiniBand to Ethernet gateways.<br /><br />-steve<br />@FStevenChalmers<br
