      "html": "Arista has support for the OC BGP model I believe in their 4.1 software.  I&#39;m not sure about other YANG models they support.  They have a few blog posts on it out there if you search around.  <br /><br />Junos&#39; entire configuration has been modeled in proprietary YANG for a few releases now.  The engine they are working on for 16.1 will allow people to write/install their own YANG modules that translate into native Junos ones, from the best of my recollection.  They certainly have working prototypes of support for the OC BGP model.  <br /><br />I am a member of the OC consortium and I think we&#39;ll continue to see more vendor adoption as providers push/require their support.  <br /><br />",
