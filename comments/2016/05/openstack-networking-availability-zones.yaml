  html: I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve missed anything, separating each datacenter into
    regions is something future users of this cloud will appreciate. As a customer
    driving APIs it doesn&#39;t really matter in cost if separation is implemented
    as AZs or regions. As an operator and for simplicity of design, it DOES matter.
    A lot.<br /><br />There is so many things that can go wrong though :-) Hopefully
    the team building this will know and understand that they will need a &quot;code-defined&quot;
    way of building x regions - and still share common configuration data across regions.
    This ability should include _all_ the network setup.<br /><br />For cross-region
    traffic I normally recommend routing dedicated internal-only Neturon networks
    through GRE tunnels secured with IPsec. IPsec is not hard when you only need to
    deal with policy for the two endpoints :)

  html: With regards to your AWS VPC peering comment and link, is this in relation
    to VPC peering across regions? If so, it is not supported and is listed as one
    of the limitations;<br /><br />&quot;You cannot create a VPC peering connection
    between VPCs in different regions.&quot;

  html: 'Hi Ivan,<br /><br />You are spot on.   We at CPLANE NETWORKS, the other SDN
    controller company you didn&#39;t mention,  provide Multi-Domain Networking by
    tying together Multiple OpenStack instances across regions using Other WAN technology
    VLAN, VPN MPLS.   Subnets are isolated to OpenStack instances.  We also provide
    an Orchestration layer above OpenStack to manage these domain on a global scale.   We
    have a lot of experience in this and have looked at the problem many ways and
    as you say, anyone trying to do this purely under OpenStack is a fools errand.   <br
    /><br />Thanks again for your insightful commentary and alignment of ideas.  '

  html: 'Another way to keep tenant networking but link those networks together is
    using VPNaaS.  This will allow the tenant to create the network connection across
    both regions and still stay within the tenant space, unlike having to use provider
    networks and other methods.  This is more multi-tenant friendly and probably a
    bit more self-service than the other options.  '

  html: Hi Ivan,<br />Thanks for the article. It is probably the closest to what I
    need, of all the ones I came across on this topic.<br />Can/will a provider network
    be common across availability zones? How are the network boundaries defined in
    openstack with respect to Regions and Availability zones? <br /><br />Hope I can
    get this clarified.<br />
