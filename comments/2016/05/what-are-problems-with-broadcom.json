      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />You are completely right, while the internal design could be secret, ASIC designers and switch vendors should clearly define the capabilities and limitations of their products. <br /> <br />The Mellanox report that you link is really interesting and insightful. While I don&#39;t know the internal architecture of the ASIC, the unfairness problems in Tomahawk seem to come from a hierarchical organization of the switch. One such organization was presented by Kim <i>et al</i> in &quot;Microarchitecture of a High-Radix Router&quot;, ISCA&#39;05 (<a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1070005\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a>). The design proposed in the paper organizes the ports in groups of 8 ports in the same &quot;row&quot;, with different groups connected by &quot;columns&quot;. <br /><br />The problem of hierarchical organizations is global fairness. While a simple round-robin (RR) arbitration mechanism is locally fair, a multi-level RR mechanism is not globally fair. This problem is clearly presented by Abts <i>et al</i> in &quot;Age-based packet arbitration in large-radix k-ary n-cubes&quot;, SC&#39;07 (see Figure 4 in this <a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5348862&amp;tag=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a>), and seems to be related to the fairness issues of the Tomahawk.<br /><br />The results in Figures 2 and 3 of the report are consistent with a hierarchical switch organization, in which ports are divided into two groups of 16 ports. In particular, with the following division: group 1 containing ports 1-8 and 25-32, and group 2 with ports 9-24. If you observe carefully the results, you can notice that each of the two groups always get 50% of the bandwidth, which is later divided evenly between the active ports of each group (this may not be obvious at first sight since the number of ports in group 1 is not consecutive, particularly in test 2 in Figure 3, but it holds in all cases). The other latency and packet loss results highlight that Tomahawk employs an internal architecture which is lossy, while Mellanox probably inherits the design from its lossless Infiniband switches. <br /><br />It is very interesting to consider that solutions designed to provide fairness at L2 (such as DCB QCN, which converges to fair shares between flows) will fail if the individual switches are not fair. Related to this, there was a European company called Gnodal (from Bristol, UK) which designed an Ethernet solution with global fairness. It employed a proprietary overlay encapsulation mechanism within its fabric, which included an &quot;Age&quot; field in the frame header used to provide per-port global fairness. Too bad they went bankrupt and their IP assets were bought by the American HPC company Cray (which had already used age-arbitration in its XC supercomputer series), maybe in a near future we might find some HPC solution from them using Ethernet with global fairness.<br /><br />If Broadcom didn&#39;t have such a dominant market share, these types of issues could cause a significant loss. Let&#39;s see if some more companies enter the 100G ASIC market. ",

Periodic packet management details, bgp flowspec, event scripts, helpful hints for traffic capture, well everything. ",
