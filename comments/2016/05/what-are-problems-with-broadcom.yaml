  html: 'Hi Ivan,<br /><br />You are completely right, while the internal design could
    be secret, ASIC designers and switch vendors should clearly define the capabilities
    and limitations of their products. <br /> <br />The Mellanox report that you link
    is really interesting and insightful. While I don&#39;t know the internal architecture
    of the ASIC, the unfairness problems in Tomahawk seem to come from a hierarchical
    organization of the switch. One such organization was presented by Kim <i>et al</i>
    in &quot;Microarchitecture of a High-Radix Router&quot;, ISCA&#39;05 (<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1070005"
    rel="nofollow">link</a>). The design proposed in the paper organizes the ports
    in groups of 8 ports in the same &quot;row&quot;, with different groups connected
    by &quot;columns&quot;. <br /><br />The problem of hierarchical organizations
    is global fairness. While a simple round-robin (RR) arbitration mechanism is locally
    fair, a multi-level RR mechanism is not globally fair. This problem is clearly
    presented by Abts <i>et al</i> in &quot;Age-based packet arbitration in large-radix
    k-ary n-cubes&quot;, SC&#39;07 (see Figure 4 in this <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5348862&amp;tag=1"
    rel="nofollow">link</a>), and seems to be related to the fairness issues of the
    Tomahawk.<br /><br />The results in Figures 2 and 3 of the report are consistent
    with a hierarchical switch organization, in which ports are divided into two groups
    of 16 ports. In particular, with the following division: group 1 containing ports
    1-8 and 25-32, and group 2 with ports 9-24. If you observe carefully the results,
    you can notice that each of the two groups always get 50% of the bandwidth, which
    is later divided evenly between the active ports of each group (this may not be
    obvious at first sight since the number of ports in group 1 is not consecutive,
    particularly in test 2 in Figure 3, but it holds in all cases). The other latency
    and packet loss results highlight that Tomahawk employs an internal architecture
    which is lossy, while Mellanox probably inherits the design from its lossless
    Infiniband switches. <br /><br />It is very interesting to consider that solutions
    designed to provide fairness at L2 (such as DCB QCN, which converges to fair shares
    between flows) will fail if the individual switches are not fair. Related to this,
    there was a European company called Gnodal (from Bristol, UK) which designed an
    Ethernet solution with global fairness. It employed a proprietary overlay encapsulation
    mechanism within its fabric, which included an &quot;Age&quot; field in the frame
    header used to provide per-port global fairness. Too bad they went bankrupt and
    their IP assets were bought by the American HPC company Cray (which had already
    used age-arbitration in its XC supercomputer series), maybe in a near future we
    might find some HPC solution from them using Ethernet with global fairness.<br
    /><br />If Broadcom didn&#39;t have such a dominant market share, these types
    of issues could cause a significant loss. Let&#39;s see if some more companies
    enter the 100G ASIC market. '

    html: 'David Roy is not a Juniper employee though, he basically debugged MX internal
      structure by himself as a customer (and continues to do so). But yes, it&#39;s
      an incredible booklet, really helpful, and I wish every vendor would write something
      like that from time to time.<br /><br />PS: David Roy&#39;s blog is just as
      incredible, I love his posts. Periodic packet management details, bgp flowspec,
      event scripts, helpful hints for traffic capture, well everything. '

  html: Juniper has an amazing &quot;An Expert Packet Walkthrough on the MX Series
    3D ...&quot; publication by David Roy. Comparable to or even better that ones
    from  Cisco.

  html: All of the Juniper books (MX, QFX) always have an amazingly detailed packet
    walk through. I believe the Juniper QFX5100 book was the first to have a very
    detailed Broadcom walk-through.

  html: Cisco has also found that Tomahawk is unable to NOT drop pause frames. So
    much for PFC, FCoE and RoCE!

  html: At Broadcom there seem to be different ASIC lines:<br />- Trident+ =&gt; Trident
    II =&gt; Tomahawk<br />- Broadcom DNX<br /><br />So, what about that DNX Qumran
    MX+? Does this ASIC have the same Problems?<br /><br />=&gt; http://community.hpe.com/hpeb/attachments/hpeb/switching-a-series-forum/7787/2/H3C-2016.pdf

  html: '&quot;Intel publishes all of their documentation.&quot;<br />Is not a true
    statement. They also require a NDA/SLA for their newest silicon.'
