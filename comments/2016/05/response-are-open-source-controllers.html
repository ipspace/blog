            <div class="comment-content">Exactly down to the point...:-)<br /><br />I have seen these slides before and I agree that it is useless marketing bla-bla.<br /><br />This is just an attempt to redirect service providers back to ODL from ONOS. It will not happen. Even academic networks are starting using ONOS on a global scale.<br /><br />The important differences between ODL and ONOS are in development philosophy. <br /><br />Performance does not matter that much, since small scale-out clusters will be used that should be organized into a hierarchy. So how an individual controller instance performs is totally unimportant.<br /><br />Huawei is also a too big organization, so the right hand does not know what the left hand does. The departments are not talking to each other, redeveloping the same things multiple times, they do not ask help from each other, even they fight against each other. I have seen a lot of this...<br /><br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Ixia is just a testing tool and if you&#39;re an experienced tester then you can simulate and test practically anything. As a former system test engineer I used Ixia to simulate T1 scale of routers and test every possible protocol. I agree that a 500x500 grid of ISIS routers doesn&#39;t look like any real network, but if you want to see if your brand new router is capable of handling such database of nodes, then it&#39;s a very good test it.<br /><br />IMO, in this case the physical topology is meaningless because the Device Under Test (DUT) is the controller. With Ixia you can send million topology change messages while having a single simulated switch with one port. It&#39;s just a CPU generating packets, nothing more. The idea is to simulate mass event, send control packets to DUT, verify correct response and measure the response time. This can be a pretty good indication whether the controller is capable of handling carrier-grade tasks or not.<br /><br />With different types of events, messages and scale one can test most of controller&#39;s functionalities in a pretty good way and compare between different types of controllers.<br /><br />If you have better suggestion how to do benchmark tests to SDN controller, please share.<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Tim,<br /><br />I agree with everything you wrote. However, my points were that:<br /><br />A) some of the tests were ridiculous and have nothing to do with real life (for example, there&#39;s no need to ever establish a flow across a sequence of 1000 switches controlled by a single controller);<br /><br />B) claiming anything about readiness for carrier-grade services based on the tests described in the presentation makes no sense.</div>
