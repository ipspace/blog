          "html": "Hi Ivan,<br />had this query for too long. Layer 2 networks are bad because of the fact that the broadcast domain extends to multiple switches. The way to overcome is to use Layer 3 routing right from the switch connecting to the hosts all throughout. Even in this such a case, let us assume a host misbehaves sends out ARP flood packets, the edge switch CPU will be burdened on processing these ARP requests. It is true though that the other switches in the network aren&#39;t affected, but the ToR connecting tot he host is affected in its CPU performance.  <br />Do you think this kind of scenario could occur (or) this is the best that can be done in the presence of a misbehaving host.",

          "html": "Yes, this can occur. You have to protect the switch CPU with Control Plane Protection (CoPP or however your vendor calls it). <br /><br />Obviously a host could DoS all adjacent hosts but at least you&#39;d protect the switch.",
