  html: Arista has support for the OC BGP model I believe in their 4.1 software.  I&#39;m
    not sure about other YANG models they support.  They have a few blog posts on
    it out there if you search around.  <br /><br />Junos&#39; entire configuration
    has been modeled in proprietary YANG for a few releases now.  The engine they
    are working on for 16.1 will allow people to write/install their own YANG modules
    that translate into native Junos ones, from the best of my recollection.  They
    certainly have working prototypes of support for the OC BGP model.  <br /><br
    />I am a member of the OC consortium and I think we&#39;ll continue to see more
    vendor adoption as providers push/require their support.  <br /><br />

    html: Pallavi, nobody ever doubted the data-driven approach the designers of Junos
      took, and I often emphasize it in my webinars, workshops and other materials.<br
      /><br />As for Junos support of OpenConfig etc, could you please point me to
      Junos documentation explaining how to configure it?<br /><br />Thank you!

  html: 'Junos has been data driven from day one. The Junos YANG models are shipped
    as part of the Junos release posting. This whitepaper elaborates how Junos supports
    OpenConfig and other standard YANG models: http://www.juniper.net/assets/us/en/local/pdf/whitepapers/2000632-en.pdf'
