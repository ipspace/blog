    html: I might be wrong, but it&#39;s my understanding that in Arista&#39;s case
      you see what&#39;s going on (at least you can look at the resulting switch configuration).

  html: If you choose Cisco ACI, you don&#39;t choose the overlay i.e. evpn... Not
    sure about Arista.  This is one of my concerns with vendors all in one solutions
    is you don&#39;t choose underlying protocols for encapsulation,  routing, etc...It
    is just supposed to work, leaving you with primarily only the controller to interact
    with.  I still think there is much to be said about rolling your own vs. just
    trusting that a vendor did all the hard work for you and the customer gets a pristine,
    always on &quot;black box&quot; which ops manages as a network fabric i.e. clos

  html: Use OpenStack on top of either one of these solutions to get away from many
    of the &quot;manual&quot; headaches of VLAN/VXLAN mapping.

    html: I know that works with OpenStack or NSX controller, but does the same functionality
      exist in the standalone CVX deployment?

    html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />With Standalone CVX - it does adv and withdraw MAC-vtep
      binding. With plugins like Openstack &amp; NSX on cvx helps one to deploy with
      different orchestration.<br />

    mac to vtep binding, just like bgp. Only problem for cvx is it is proprietary.  '

  html: Provisioning goes hand in hand with inventory, having a good and flexible
    inventory model here would be the key. So :) actually neither cisco nor arista
    could convince me that they are good in provisioning service fulfillment kind
    of business.

  html: Ivan.. Pls look at Cisco VTS controller.<br /><br />It does all the overlay
    provisioning for you, with integration to vCenter or OpenStack. It even comes
    with a software forwarder for doing the VTEP all the way on the host, called VTF
    (based on XR code and VPP dataplane), which increases scale om leaf VNI mappings,
    as well as increases flexibility.<br /><br />VTS also acts as EVPN route-reflector
    for VTEP&#39;s to overcome scaling issues on the switches RIB and controlplane
    in very large deployments. Further it can provision the DCI routers (if ASR9K)<br
