  html: 'One important thing to note is different behavior of &#39;implicit deny&#39;
    rule, from Cisco website: &#39;Once a route is matched in a route map permit entry
    with a continue command clause, it will not be processed by the implicit deny
    at the end of the route-map.&#39; So generally it&#39;s a good idea to add explicit
    deny rule as the last entry in route-map with &#39;continue&#39; statements.'
