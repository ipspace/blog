      "html": "I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve missed anything, separating each datacenter into regions is something future users of this cloud will appreciate. As a customer driving APIs it doesn&#39;t really matter in cost if separation is implemented as AZs or regions. As an operator and for simplicity of design, it DOES matter. A lot.<br /><br />There is so many things that can go wrong though :-) Hopefully the team building this will know and understand that they will need a &quot;code-defined&quot; way of building x regions - and still share common configuration data across regions. This ability should include _all_ the network setup.<br /><br />For cross-region traffic I normally recommend routing dedicated internal-only Neturon networks through GRE tunnels secured with IPsec. IPsec is not hard when you only need to deal with policy for the two endpoints :)",

      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />You are spot on.   We at CPLANE NETWORKS, the other SDN controller company you didn&#39;t mention,  provide Multi-Domain Networking by tying together Multiple OpenStack instances across regions using Other WAN technology VLAN, VPN MPLS.   Subnets are isolated to OpenStack instances.  We also provide an Orchestration layer above OpenStack to manage these domain on a global scale.   We have a lot of experience in this and have looked at the problem many ways and as you say, anyone trying to do this purely under OpenStack is a fools errand.   <br /><br />Thanks again for your insightful commentary and alignment of ideas.

      "html": "Another way to keep tenant networking but link those networks together is using VPNaaS.  This will allow the tenant to create the network connection across both regions and still stay within the tenant space, unlike having to use provider networks and other methods.  This is more multi-tenant friendly and probably a bit more self-service than the other options.  ",

It is probably the closest to what I need, of all the ones I came across on this topic.<br />Can/will a provider network be common across availability zones? How are the network boundaries defined in openstack with respect to Regions and Availability zones? <br /><br />Hope I can get this clarified.<br />",
