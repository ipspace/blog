    html: Of course you could do that (and get 4x the number of ports in the ideal
      case), but the wiring tends to be a mess.

  html: I see that the smaller example uses 6 spines. Wouldn&#39;t it be possible
    to use 24 spines with 40G to 4x10G breakouts (40gbase-lr4 to 4x10gbase-lr)?<br
    />Counting for the Trident  II limit of 104 interfaces we should reach 4992 10G
    ports out of 104 leaf and 24 spines?
