            <div class="comment-content">The author does have many good points and your counter points aren&#39;t that strong. You missed out in Cisco hardware lock in for most of their solutions. What about ripping 5ks for 9ks? Proprietary protocols like EIGRP and VTP? Every vendor is going to have some form of secret sauce of proprietary but Cisco just takes it to the next level. And seeing how you use Cisco to pay your bills I can see your bias.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I understand the frustration of the person who wrote the article. In my work experience, I have faced the challenge of the 800 lb gorilla to one degree or another. I have provided solution options based on requirements for large and small efforts and I am baffled by how often Cisco is selected despite the fact that they are clearly the most expensive, sometimes by a large margin. When I ask why, they essentially quote the &quot;never get fired for buying Cisco&quot; line. I even had one VP shrug and say that he&#39;s never even heard of the other vendors (he doesn&#39;t follow the industry). So, gripe about their technology, their approach, the complexity... it doesn&#39;t matter. It doesn&#39;t even matter if you have a legitimately better/cheaper/faster product. Cisco has successfully waged their marketing/culture/perception campaign and THAT is where your challenges lie. If you can&#39;t counter this, then best of luck to you. Arista and others have successfully nibbled at this in carrier/cloud/trading markets, but not so much in enterprise markets.<br /><br />On a positive note, with more and more webscale companies going white box (or branded whitebox) and writing their own OS, I&#39;m at least seeing more decision-makers asking &quot;why&quot;, and that is the first step. Revolutions begin like this...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">In summary: &quot;why Cisco can get away with this better than $vendor?‚Äù ;))<br /><br />Because they consistently invested in building mindshare for the last 25 years:<br /><br />* Publicly available documentation and release notes;<br />* Design guides and technical whitepapers that are more than blatant self-promotion;<br />* Reasonably-good training (don&#39;t get me started on Cisco training, but I&#39;ve seen some others);<br />* Certifications that have actual career value;<br />* Above-average support;<br />* Conferences with high-quality presentations;<br />* Conference presentations and videos being publicly available<br />* ...<br /><br />If you do that just 5% better than the average, the compound effect over 25 years reaches 240% (1.05^25-1). I&#39;d say that Cisco (overall) is way more than 5% better than average.<br /><br />Makes sense?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">First, want to be extraordinarily clear that what I say here is my own opinion, and is not the position of my employer (which happens to be Hewlett Packard Enterprise).<br /><br />Observation: HPE did create a very simple network edge in Virtual Connect, which has been on the market for almost a decade.  Being simple meant it was in a server paradigm and not a network paradigm.  This works for some people and not for others.<br /><br />Crystal ball (at which my track record is mixed): I believe that in some university somewhere in the world, a couple of graduate students will be trying to integrate data center networking into yet another Ansible/Puppet/Chef type application deployment framework, will get frustrated trying to deal with networking as we know it, and will write a little shim that runs over the Broadcom SDK (or one of its competitors) which solves their problem deploying and running applications (is a good enough underlay for Calico, for example).  They&#39;ll use white box switches because there were a few sitting around (they were cheap).  This software will turn out to be generally useful in Ethernet-backbone supercomputers and in an interesting subset of data centers.  It is not networking as we know it.  Bridging this to the real network is an &quot;interesting&quot; problem, with precedents in InfiniBand to Ethernet gateways.<br /><br />-steve<br />@FStevenChalmers<br /><br /><br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">I would say that what you&#39;ve seen in your crystal ball has already happened at large cloud providers/web properties and is slowly trickling down toward the mass adoption.<br /><br />However, I doubt we&#39;ll see any significant change in the way networking works (there are only so many ways to solve a problem given external constraints) as long as we have to keep at least the socket API intact.

            <div class="comment-content">Good catch.  I was trying to make the point that moving packets between two endpoints (two sockets interfaces seen by application components) in a data center is a lot simpler than what NICs and switches do today.  <br /><br />Google has the resources to reinvent that complexity, while my hypothetical graduate students simply cannot.<br /><br />For example, imagine a data center plumbed with Sockets Direct Protocol, using Calico-like microsegmentation, and using a DNS-like service to find endpoints (sockets).  The application wouldn&#39;t care whether the underlay was good old Ethernet, ACI, InfiniBand, Omni-Path, or whatever gets invented next.<br /><br />And yes, you are right about the external constraints.  A Google data center has millions of north/south connections to the outside world (and that&#39;s just to serve the ads) as well as inter-data-center traffic.  The place where &quot;dumb and simple&quot; inside the data center meets &quot;real networking&quot; at the data center edge is challenging, but doable, as InfiniBand has shown.<br /><br />Will be interesting to watch over the next 20 years and see how this plays out.<br /><br />-steve</div>
