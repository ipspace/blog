      "html": "I think RR as a VM makes a lot of sense. With traditional IP forwarding we had the possibility of route deflection so the RR&#39;s should be placed in path of the topology.<br /><br />At this point in time I would assume that all ISP&#39;s do label switched forwarding for Internet traffic also though so it should not be an issue even in that case.<br /><br />MPLS VPNs don&#39;t have this problem of course since the egress exit point is determined at ingress and there is no hop by hop decision on forwarding.<br /><br />By running it in a VM you could shift the workload while you are patching one of the RR&#39;s. It&#39;s trivial to add memory and CPU which would not be the case for a physical router.<br /><br />The drawback seems to be the licensing which is more expensive than one would imagine (isn&#39;t that always the case?).",

      "html": "Decoupling the compute-centric function of RR from the expensive forwarding hardware is sensible, but the assumption that it&#39;s also then right to go all-in centralised rather than distributed can be more of a per-address family question.<br /><br />It works for private VPN address families where NLRIs are relatively unique, but BGP&#39;s lack of ability to communicate more than the active path is a hindrance for the Internet table, since any moderately geographically-diverse network with peering ends up requiring quite localised route selection.<br /><br />BGP ORR is an interesting option to address this problem, but I can&#39;t help thinking that the fixation on centralisation of what is a crucially a distributed compute problem is the main issue.",

      "html": "ORR and add-path are tools you could use together or independently to create a few clusters of RRs on a larger network to simulate what is fully distributed.  ORR is available from both Juniper and Cisco, albeit via the most bleeding edge software and Juniper only supports IS-IS today.<br /><br />On my network for instance I have 20+ sites today in a full mesh, and they act as RRs for downstream routers.  I could likely replace all of that with 3 pairs of servers running multiple vRR VMs for different domains along with ORR for true best path selection.  ",

Obviously, they still should sit in a spot of the network where it makes sense. In addition, this gives agility and fault domain containment to operators who can now easily deploy multiple vRR for different address families, such as IPv4, VPNv4, MVPN, IPv6, etc.",
