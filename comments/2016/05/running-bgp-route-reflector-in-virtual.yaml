  html: I think RR as a VM makes a lot of sense. With traditional IP forwarding we
    had the possibility of route deflection so the RR&#39;s should be placed in path
    of the topology.<br /><br />At this point in time I would assume that all ISP&#39;s
    do label switched forwarding for Internet traffic also though so it should not
    be an issue even in that case.<br /><br />MPLS VPNs don&#39;t have this problem
    of course since the egress exit point is determined at ingress and there is no
    hop by hop decision on forwarding.<br /><br />By running it in a VM you could
    shift the workload while you are patching one of the RR&#39;s. It&#39;s trivial
    to add memory and CPU which would not be the case for a physical router.<br /><br
    />The drawback seems to be the licensing which is more expensive than one would
    imagine (isn&#39;t that always the case?).

    html: BGP Add-path could be a tool to use for this, no?<br /><br />Not that I
      am advocating a centralised RR setup.

    html: Add path could definitely be used. There is an interesting presentation

  html: Decoupling the compute-centric function of RR from the expensive forwarding
    hardware is sensible, but the assumption that it&#39;s also then right to go all-in
    centralised rather than distributed can be more of a per-address family question.<br
    /><br />It works for private VPN address families where NLRIs are relatively unique,
    but BGP&#39;s lack of ability to communicate more than the active path is a hindrance
    for the Internet table, since any moderately geographically-diverse network with
    peering ends up requiring quite localised route selection.<br /><br />BGP ORR
    is an interesting option to address this problem, but I can&#39;t help thinking
    that the fixation on centralisation of what is a crucially a distributed compute
    problem is the main issue.

  html: the big issue is still fault domain separations. if the vrr is down you need
    a team to check the hypervisor(HDD,network interfaces,etc) and another team to
    check/debug the protocol; not sure how many noc teams have both skill sets at
    the moment.

  html: 'ORR and add-path are tools you could use together or independently to create
    a few clusters of RRs on a larger network to simulate what is fully distributed.  ORR
    is available from both Juniper and Cisco, albeit via the most bleeding edge software
    and Juniper only supports IS-IS today.<br /><br />On my network for instance I
    have 20+ sites today in a full mesh, and they act as RRs for downstream routers.  I
    could likely replace all of that with 3 pairs of servers running multiple vRR
    VMs for different domains along with ORR for true best path selection.  '

  html: This makes total sense. Running BGP RR in some x86 servers brings in a lot
    of benefits, including a separation of control plane and forwarding plane, cost
    reduction and flexibility. Obviously, they still should sit in a spot of the network
    where it makes sense. In addition, this gives agility and fault domain containment
    to operators who can now easily deploy multiple vRR for different address families,
    such as IPv4, VPNv4, MVPN, IPv6, etc.
