      "html": "Yes one of the first steps of the recovery plan should be doing a manual shutdown at the edge of the DC being recovered - even physically pulling the cables if power is not available.  Even if IP addresses don&#39;t conflict plenty of clustering / replication solutions will break if not resynchronized very carefully.",

      "html": "I find another gotcha is when you have a DR server in &quot;hot standby&quot; mode (turned on and accessible in another DC/Subnet) where you may have forgotten to disable certain services from running.. only to find out the next time the DR server is rebooted, the DR services set to &quot;automatic&quot; begin to run, when they should not have. In this case we had an enterprise job scheduler accidentally start tasks against our banking systems which had already been run hours ago.. causing duplicate entries in the banking database.. I guess you know where the rest of the story leads.. accounting staff and customers not being very happy. ",
