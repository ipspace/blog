      "html": "It seems the pendulum in the last 10 years is swinging back to the giant centralized systems. There are many enterprises that used to, and still do, minimize the risk of a physical server failure by spreading workloads across dozens of small servers (4 cores &amp; 8GB ram). With low end brand name servers starting a 8 cores and 64GB ram and customers unwilling to take the &quot;risk&quot; of putting more than 2 virtual machines on a hypervisor, I&#39;ve contemplated recommending these customers start using mini-PCs like Intel NUCs. I think there is a big section of the market that doesn&#39;t need or want the scale.",
