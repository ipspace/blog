Both &quot;path&quot; and &quot;plane&quot; seem to be used, we don&#39;t have a source of truth yet as nobody has written out the acronym in the kernel source yet ;-)<br /><br />Regarding origin: I meant to say that the origins of the XDP discussion come from a CloudFlare preso at NetDev0.1 which illustrated the problem and use of BPF to determine how to program the NIC tuple filters to drop. This lead to the discussions evolving into XDP and XDP_DROP. As usual, many have been involved, it wouldn&#39;t be fair to say that this is entirely a Facebook development either.",

      "html": "Small correction - XDP is &quot;Express Data Path&quot; and it wasn&#39;t really started by Cloudfare. Rather, Cloudfare used a specific kernel bypass techniques (bifurcated driver) that (among other reasons) stimulated interest in building &quot;kernel bypass inside kernel&quot;.  Original initiators were Alexei Starovoitov and Tom Herbert (both work at Facebook), but lots of work has been also done by other folks (e.g. Brenden Blanco).<br /><br />https://github.com/iovisor/bpf-docs/blob/master/Express_Data_Path.pdf<br />https://lwn.net/Articles/682538/<br /><br />In few words, eBPF and XDP are kinda hot in Linux networking right now and Cilium is definitely using a lot of the new machinery :)",
