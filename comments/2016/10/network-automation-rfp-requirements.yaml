    html: Donatas, you know that for big networks, having agents won&#39;t make automation
      scale. Agentless is still better in that it uses the built-in/existing protocol.
      Also, from a cost perspective, agents can be expensive.

    html: 'There are a few problems with this request in that you are asking network
      vendors to <br />A.) Support &quot;CM&quot; tools that were created for server
      systems and their state, not configuration <br />B.) Use these tools to provide
      &quot;CM&quot; for configuration - which is what you are mostly concerned with
      on network devices. <br />C.) Idempotency for configuration, without context,
      is much harder than idempotency for state - i.e. is service X running, is pkg
      Y installed, etc.<br />D.) As Leke mentioned, scaling the disposition and logistics
      of these agents is very tough when you get into the thousands of devices.<br
      /><br />All that being said, there are several vendors that support both Puppet
      and Chef in one form or another.  Junos supports them on all but the SRX and
      PTX platforms as of their latest release.  <br /><br />Both Ansible and Saltstack
      are much better ways of attacking network state/configuration management than
      Puppet and Chef.  Ansible doesn&#39;t require agents at all and SaltStack has
      a great proxy system that allows for their proxy agents to work without much
      configuration at all and work against any device you want it to, regardless
      of vendor.  You just have to have the modules - the same way you do for Ansible
      anyway.  <br /><br />This is a case of missing the forest for the trees.  You
      are narrowing down your focus for automation based on the set criteria of a
      product.  And, that product wasn&#39;t even meant to do what you want in the
      first place.  To really get the most out of automation, what Ivan has put together
      is a base set of must haves or don&#39;t even attempt it.  If you are not looking
      at the capabilities of the vendor OS from the perspective of what you need to
      accomplish business (not technical) objectives via automation, then you are
      missing said forest.  '

  html: What I&#39;m actually missing today from network OS is seamlessly running
    automation software agents, for instance chef-client, puppet slave, etc.. OpenSwitch
    tried that, but still missing this. Cumulus doesn&#39;t have this too, only agent-less
    is supported. Of course, you can make it work, but it would be workaround, not
    just built-in solution.

  html: 'No intermediate abstract software from OEM for automation. We tried doing
    automating Alteon SLB using vDirect. But the catch is you have to create template
    residing in vDirect and API calls to be built in our automation software. Moreoever
    template should be built in a specific language - Apache Velocity. This counter-intuitively
    complicates the entire automation process, so we rolled back to CLI based screen-scraping
    automation. '

    with documentation, if possible in YANG since it seems to be current way.<br />Also
    we are talking about devops, telemetry is to be supported with support of http

  html: "I came across this, while preparing something similar, but at a higher level\
    \ and had posted requesting comments in the network to code slack team:<br /><br\
    \ />\xFC  The device should lend itself to virtualization, as deployed in production\
    \ - so, if it is a firewall, it should be &#39;virutalizable&#39; with all production\
    \ features (multi-context, transparent firewall etc)<br />\xFC  The device should\
    \ be created with an api-first approach (especially if it is a closed vendor).\
    \ If there is a feature on the product, it should be accessible via an API<br\
    \ />\xFC  If the enterprise intends to manage the device using a centrallized\
    \ controller (BigIQ, CSM etc), every feature on that management platfrom should\
    \ be available as a north-bound API, consumable by automation tools<br /><br /><br\
    \ />====<br />However, since then, I have been rethinking the API piece. Given\
    \ that we look up to our *nix pioneers as standard bearers for system automation,\
    \ why do we demand it? I am now more inclined to think, that the API mandate should\
    \ only be if the vendor OS is a closed system. If an open system vendor, creates\
    \ APIs for applications running on their system (say for BGP configs) - kudos\
    \ to them, but no longer think that should be mandated. Something like Ansible\
    \ could be the &#39;API broker&#39; for higher level workflow tools, to interact\
    \ with the services on that platform....<br /><br />Thoughts?"

    html: Dear Anonymous,<br /><br />Thanks for a marketing manifesto ;) If you&#39;d
      have shared your contact details or contacted me offline, we could add IOS XR
      to the lists. Alas...<br /><br />Now for the details:<br /><br />&quot;Cisco
      is big time into Model Driven Manageability&quot; &lt;&lt; what counts for me
      is what&#39;s shipping and documented. Big-time statements and visions are nice,
      executing on them is even better.<br /><br />&quot;Retrieval of Structured Operational
      data on IOS-XR and Nexus&quot; &lt;&lt; Nexus OS is in the list. See above for
      IOS-XR.<br /><br />Streaming telemetry - interesting, but not the topic of this
      blog post.<br /><br />Open Config and IETF models - mentioned.<br /><br />Structured
      configuration data - Cisco has at least four different network operating systems,
      so please specify which one(s) support it. The last time I checked Nexus OS
      didn&#39;t even have &quot;get-config&quot; NETCONF command. I know that has
      been added, but I haven&#39;t tested what it returns yet. Checking how XML configuration
      looks in latest versions of IOS XE is already on my to-do list.

  html: 'Cisco is big time into Model Driven Manageability, with support for well
    defined data models for both configuration and operational data. Cisco provides
    development kits that allow for manipulation of the data models programmatically.<br
    /><br />Cisco does support retrieval of Structured Operational data on IOS-XR
    and Nexus platforms in the recent releases. The operational data can be streamed
    out from the router and received by a client with a push model, rather than the
    pull model normally supported with SNMP.  The telemetry stream can formatted in
    JSON, Google Protocol Buffers or Google KeyValue Protocol Buffer formats. The
    streaming telemetry is supported using the non-proprietary Open Config Telemetry
    model for subscribing to the operational data that the user is interested in.
    Most of the Open Config models are supported and Cisco native models are supported
    for other areas that don&#39;t have either OC models or the OC models are still
    being worked out. The subscriptions can themselves be made over Netconf/XML or
    Google RPC session to the router.<br /><br />Cisco also supports structured configuration
    data by the way of ITEF/Open Config/Cisco Native Yang Models over a Netconf session.<br
    />Cisco also supports Google RPC mechanism to push a config change structured
    as a JSON object to the router.<br /><br />Cisco also has built and open sourced
    a framework called YDK (Yang Development Kit) that allows a user to compile the
    yang models into objects in a language like python (other language bindings are
    being worked on). The user is then able to manipulate the config on the router
    by programmatically setting attributes on the config objects and performing a
    CRUD operation  to write the data to the router to have the config take affect. '

  html: 'Hello Ivan! First of all thank you for the post. It is very good idea to
    make the structured list of requirements to classify the current situation with
    the vendors gear. And it is important to the community to have got the minimally
    adequate list of the requirements to be able further to automate device configuration
    in the right manner.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I am not represent/work for any vendor
    of the equipment. It is just my experience. If any of my thoughts are not right,
    may be I have used not right tool for this or I have not enough information about
    the vendor devices, because it is not publicly available.<br /><br />So having
    netconf is good. But devices also must publish all the configuration modules,
    as the capabilities in the netconf hello messages. I have tried IOS-XR and JunOS.
    It is not true f.e. for JunOS. But works for IOS-XR.<br /><br />The next key thing
    is the ability to get YANG modules out from the device for declared capabilities
    (ietf-netconf-monitoring RFC6022). it works well for both JunOS and IOS-XR.<br
    /><br />And the last but not least. The obtained YANG modules must be able to
    be compiled ;-). F.e. with publicly available pyang, but more than that better
    with &quot;pyang --ietf&quot;. So this not true for both of them IOS-XR for several
    modules. And for JunOS YANG models gotten out from device.<br /><br />So industry
    is heading further for the bright future and this good for all of us. But clear
    some marketing hype sometimes also very important.'

  html: We need much more. NETCONF is not designed for real-time control loops. As
    usual network devices are so bad compared to real-life needs that we would need
    a hybrid SDN architecture to have the possibility of correcting what the vendors
    are not motivated to do. But none of the big vendors support this. They have some
    fake implementations of programmibility. But when you really want to use them,
    you recognize it is unfinished, not enough fast, not scalable, etc. In safety
    critical network it is still better to stick to TDM (PDH/SDH) and wait for some
    reasonable solutions to come out. New generation of SD-WAN is a step into the
    right direction, but still a lot to do...<br />

  html: I disagree that streaming telemetry/statistics aren&#39;t relevant to this
    hypothetical RFP.  In recent years, network devices have become far less responsive
    as API&#39;s are decoupled from OS&#39;s, and OS&#39;s are decoupled from ASICs.
    For example, CLI/SNMP counters are no longer real-time but instead refreshed every
    5-15 seconds. Meanwhile, SNMP TRAP &amp; Syslog events are lazily dispatched (though
    their embedded timestamps are largely accurate). This loss of &quot;tactility&quot;
    can be a real problem for a modern network tuned for millisecond control plane.
    It&#39;s worth pressing your vendor on this topic.
