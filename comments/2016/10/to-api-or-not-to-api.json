      "html": "The remainder of the original comment rephrased here was,&quot;...Something like Ansible could be the &#39;API broker&#39; for higher level workflow tools, to interact with the services on that platform....&quot;<br /><br />Given the context of this extended comment, I think I may have to disagree and assert that an API (or something like it) should be required. (Maybe I&#39;m just misunderstanding the &quot;open&quot; vs &quot;closed&quot; system piece?)<br /><br />Driverless vehicles come to mind. As ain initial POC, maybe the steering wheel, accelerator, brakes, and gear selectors are fitted with clunky &quot;sticks and servos&quot;, engineered to dial in just the right combination of kinetic output to command the vehicle. In practice, however, such modifications would be more tightly integrated with the underlying controlling mechanisms, instead of struggling to control the abstractions.<br /><br />While something like Ansible as an &quot;API broker&quot; might be a feasible short- to mid-term solution, might we not be incurring more technical debt in the future by being so loose on the standards requirements in the present?",
