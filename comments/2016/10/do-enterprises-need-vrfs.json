      "html": "We have three different zones. External datacenter networks, internal datacenter networks, office networks. Some sites have all three of them. We use different VRFs for that, exactly because we don&#39;t want to use stretched VLANs, and use RIP on VMs to announce their location for VM mobility. And firewalls with interfaces in all three VRFs for inter-VRF traffic.<br /><br />Can&#39;t say it&#39;s simple but it works with less headaches than one routing domain.",

You call PBR simple, I consider VRFs simpler than distributed PBR, which you&#39;d have to have in virtualized environments with VM mobility. <br /><br />Also, in your case you&#39;d need devices that allow you to configure PBR on L2-only interfaces (or you&#39;d be back in VRF world).",
