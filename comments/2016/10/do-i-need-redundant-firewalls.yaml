  html: 'Of course, budget and RTO are kings here.<br /><br />I think that if &quot;designs
    involving several more than 2 DCs spread over different locations&quot; involves
    something like good timed &quot;anycast&quot; for example, it can be a pretty
    good solution in case of mostly static webserver contents (like free wordpress
    blogs!). But on the other hand, a webapp/mobile app server for like online work/don&#39;t
    know what but relied to work, would be disastrous: the sessions have to be retained
    as long as possible, that means :<br /><br />-highly redundant hardware (multiple
    PSUs, high quality DC, high quality components)<br />-highly redundant hardware
    architecture (multiple clustered FWs with intelligent clustering techniques/protocols)<br
    />-highly redundant uplinks<br />-etc<br /><br />THEN only you can start thinking
    about a disaster recovery plan. Which is meant, as you know, for real disasters,
    not for &quot;FW uplink port failure&quot; scenarios.<br /><br />So as always,
    it depends. But people mix things up if they think a disaster recovery plan  can
    be used in case of a &quot;SPOF&quot; failure.'

  html: 'State sharing imho is not worth the complexity it adds to the system. This
    complexity is what causes the software to become way more senstive and increases
    the risk with a whole new can of problems. Catching non-cluster software faults
    with a twin-brother that has the same software doesn&#39;t make sence as well.
    <br />Running a secondary unit from maybe a different SW train or another vendor
    AND make sure that the config definition is maintained on an external system that
    configures a change on the secondary only if it&#39;s been running succesfull
    on the first for X-time is way better imho.<br /><br />Also: who needs a stinking
    firewall:)'
