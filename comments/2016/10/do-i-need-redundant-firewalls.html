            <div class="comment-content">Of course, budget and RTO are kings here.<br /><br />I think that if &quot;designs involving several more than 2 DCs spread over different locations&quot; involves something like good timed &quot;anycast&quot; for example, it can be a pretty good solution in case of mostly static webserver contents (like free wordpress blogs!). But on the other hand, a webapp/mobile app server for like online work/don&#39;t know what but relied to work, would be disastrous: the sessions have to be retained as long as possible, that means :<br /><br />-highly redundant hardware (multiple PSUs, high quality DC, high quality components)<br />-highly redundant hardware architecture (multiple clustered FWs with intelligent clustering techniques/protocols)<br />-highly redundant uplinks<br />-etc<br /><br />THEN only you can start thinking about a disaster recovery plan. Which is meant, as you know, for real disasters, not for &quot;FW uplink port failure&quot; scenarios.<br /><br />So as always, it depends. But people mix things up if they think a disaster recovery plan  can be used in case of a &quot;SPOF&quot; failure.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">State sharing imho is not worth the complexity it adds to the system. This complexity is what causes the software to become way more senstive and increases the risk with a whole new can of problems. Catching non-cluster software faults with a twin-brother that has the same software doesn&#39;t make sence as well. <br />Running a secondary unit from maybe a different SW train or another vendor AND make sure that the config definition is maintained on an external system that configures a change on the secondary only if it&#39;s been running succesfull on the first for X-time is way better imho.<br /><br />Also: who needs a stinking firewall:)</div>
