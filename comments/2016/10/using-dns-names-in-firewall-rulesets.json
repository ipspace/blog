Otherwise you will have traffic blockholing every time someone changes the IP address of the website.<br />As a side node, since Cisco&#39;s ASAs follow the similar approach (resolve hostnames when rules are created and install IP addresses), it makes it really difficult to create firewall rules for SaaS services (O365, Salesforce). And the official workaround is to include huge ranges (/18, /19) that those SaaS services use(hoping that they use them exclusively). Needless to say that it requires update every time they add a new hosting location.",

In our case we didn&#39;t use DNS though, we used instead puppet classes (we were using puppet for server mgmt). So developers could express what they needed in the form of &quot;src: frontend_svca, dst: backend_b, port: tcp/12345&quot;. Ansible then would expand frontend_svca and backend_b using the data in puppetdb and deploy the address-book and the policy in the firewall. Every time a new frontend or backend was deployed/decomissioned the playbook would be run and the address-book would be updated. In this scenario only new policies had to be approved. If a new server was deployed everything could be deployed automatically.",

I&#39;ll argue that now the best way I see is container micro-services where developers are responsible to define their policies for IP communications. It&#39;s not perfect because devs were big fans of &quot;chmod -R 777&quot; on unix, so I fear they are not to be completely trusted for defining security policies.<br /><br /> - On another side, most comments are asking for filtering &quot;*.download.windowsupdate.com&quot; on the firewall. This particular issue, filtering websites domains, can be easily managed with a good old web proxy. It&#39;s way better than any firewall tricks. Moreover, you can authenticate the requests at the proxy level.",

But how long does it takes? 4 hours? 24 hours? More? On the one hand, client&#39;s TTL may times out faster than firewall control plane&#39;s TTL. Clients will try to connect to new IP - and fail! On the other hand it&#39;s an issue vice-versa, too. Anyway, the DNS approach ends in a multifaceted issue for changes.<br />I guess the only valid &quot;dynamic&quot; way for internal destinations is to use a service discovery system like Consul etc. These directories have an clear view of instances available for a service (plus used tcp/udp port). If an instance is removed, firewall control plane can update the rule.<br />In case of external destinations looking into certificate details is a valid approach but only for TLS/SSL secured connections.",
