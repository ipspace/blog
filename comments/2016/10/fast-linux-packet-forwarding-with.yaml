    html: 'Thanks Petr. Both &quot;path&quot; and &quot;plane&quot; seem to be used,
      we don&#39;t have a source of truth yet as nobody has written out the acronym
      in the kernel source yet ;-)<br /><br />Regarding origin: I meant to say that
      the origins of the XDP discussion come from a CloudFlare preso at NetDev0.1
      which illustrated the problem and use of BPF to determine how to program the
      NIC tuple filters to drop. This lead to the discussions evolving into XDP and
      XDP_DROP. As usual, many have been involved, it wouldn&#39;t be fair to say
      that this is entirely a Facebook development either.'

  html: Small correction - XDP is &quot;Express Data Path&quot; and it wasn&#39;t
    really started by Cloudfare. Rather, Cloudfare used a specific kernel bypass techniques
    (bifurcated driver) that (among other reasons) stimulated interest in building
    &quot;kernel bypass inside kernel&quot;.  Original initiators were Alexei Starovoitov
    and Tom Herbert (both work at Facebook), but lots of work has been also done by
    other folks (e.g. Brenden Blanco).<br /><br />https://github.com/iovisor/bpf-docs/blob/master/Express_Data_Path.pdf<br
    />https://lwn.net/Articles/682538/<br /><br />In few words, eBPF and XDP are kinda
    hot in Linux networking right now and Cilium is definitely using a lot of the
    new machinery :)

    html: Absolutely. We just need to find someone to invest in transcribing and editing
      the transcript, and I&#39;ll be more than glad to publish it along with the
      podcast ;)

  html: Hi Ivan, is it possible to publish the podcast with the corresponding transcript?
    It makes great sense to listen to podcast, and it will be greater if user could
    also select to read the transcript alone or together with podcast.
