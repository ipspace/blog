    html: If VRF = L3 virtualization technologies, than I saw that link. (however
      VRFs are again just a tiny piece of the whole story).<br />Nevermind my jabbering
      ... great post, thanks for sharing!

    html: If you want to have a L3 virtualization technology, you need a separate
      forwarding table for each virtual L3 domain (like you need a separate MAC table
      for each virtual L2 domain).<br /><br />You also need some way of populating
      that table, usually a routing protocol. VRF (regardless of how you call it)
      is thus a fundamental building block of every L3 virtualization technology.

  html: Great post - thank you for that.<br />However, the initial question bugs me
    a little. MPLS is not a solution to a problem - it&#39;s a packet encapsulation
    and forwarding method.<br /><br />From my opinion the question is, do enterprises
    need layer-3 virtualization technologies. If yes, MPLS (along with some additional
    protocols and features) could be the right choice.<br /><br />But this is only
    a helping tool for a problem (e.g. separation of security zones). Maybe there
    are other technologies like VRF lite (as you said), LISP, proprietary stuff like
    SGT.

  html: Like DWDM, MPLS is a fantastic solution if you need to keep traffic flows
    separate, but like DWDM it typically requires some initial capital investment
    and re-architecture. (Not all vendor hardware supports true CE/PE/P MPLS infrastructure
    in their code, many just do VRF lite). You need to spend some time pondering the
    TCO/ROI.<br /><br />For instance, if your current $employer has multiple campuses
    or data centers and someone asks to deploy a &quot;test&quot; environment comprised
    of multiple isolated VLANs at each location, that&#39;s easy. If they then ask
    you to have them all talk to each other (and ONLY to each other due to security
    concerns) then you are doing ACLs (ugh), firewalls, L2 tunnels or L3 tunnels.
    The firewall solution is fine but it doesn&#39;t scale... every site you add will
    require one. Also firewalls don&#39;t give you the flexibility of Layer-1, 2 and
    3 tunnels. <br /><br />If you invest in an MPLS infrastructure then you can spin
    up that VRF everywhere you need it. I think a good example of this is a lot of
    educational institutions run separate VRFs across a common infrastructure to keep
    the faculty traffic 100% separated from all the young blackhats on the student
    networks. Most educational IT staff don&#39;t have the budget to purchase and
    refresh large firewall populations, so VRF&#39;ing it all to a centralized pair
    is cost effective. It should definitely be considered anytime you have a &quot;keep
    this from talking to that, but let it talk to other things&quot; challenge. Yes,
    there are other alternatives such as DMVPN but these again become problematic
    as they scale up, and they don&#39;t give you the Layer 1-3 options.<br /><br
    />The documentation, adoption and operational handoff isn&#39;t any worse than
    other solutions. I recommend at least considering it even for small/medium efforts.

  html: Also worth noting:<br /><br />MPLS can help in designing a simple and stable
    core that isn&#39;t subject to the volatility of routing / topology changes at
    the edge.  I agree these objectives can be satisfied with other solutions, but
    as autarch01 says, implementing MPLS doesn&#39;t have to be worse than other options.
    I would argue that MPLS is in a similar place to where BGP was in many enterprises
    a few years ago ... perceived as prohibitively complex and scary, when it doesn&#39;t
    have to be.<br /><br />There are some significant advantages to MPLS when it comes
    to upgrading or expanding the core (P) routers as you don&#39;t have to consider
    &#39;customer&#39; routes.<br /><br />Using 6VPE you can implement IPv6 without
    having to re-engineer the core (P) routers.<br /><br />If running multicast, some
    nice options for minimising the amount of multicast state information the core
    has to maintain.<br /><br />Some security advantages as well, in terms of options
    for protecting the core control plane if the design maintains separacy of &#39;customer&#39;
    and global routing tables.<br />
