      "html": "SSL doesn&#39;t make your internal network more reliable, it makes it less reliable because you are now susceptible to SSL issues in addition to TCP issues, IP issues, and network issues.  HOWEVER, SSL makes your internal network more secure.  If a Bad Guy gets into your data center somehow, but is not in your servers or load balancers yet, then SSL protects your data from the Bad Guy.  Your Bad Guy could be a DC staff member.<br />So it depends on if your DC is trustworthy or not.  If not, then definitely use SSL",

      "html": "The bad guys are already in your network. If you think that they aren&#39;t then you are most likely deluding yourself. Building things and then not being able to take measurements means that you are operating at least in part by faith. How many days so your systems wait to be patched? Do you use configuration management to catch configuration drift? Do you at least audit configuration drift? The things that actually cause breaches are slow patching tempo and administrative shortcuts. Yes the NSA can bust a buffer overflow in some device. Most large breaches cone from one of your admins taking a shortcut to meet a crazy arbitrary deadline and then going home before &quot;fixing&quot; the shortcut. (On a system that can only be patched once a quarter so that no one gets yelled at.)<br /><br />We need to stop pretending that we are doing this well.",

      "html": "More and more apps do SSL by default and it&#39;s getting trickier to turn off redirects. So as a matter of practicality, we do SSL on the back end. The security is a nice bonus, but it&#39;s really so we can stick to standard/default app set up to get stuff done faster.<br /><br />It&#39;s also worth mentioning that we pay one (actually small) fee for unlimited certificates and can generate one in about 5 minutes. Our entire infrastructure team is pretty well practiced in getting real SSL certs generated and installed.",

      "html": "In my experience attacks at app level can go hidden a lot easier with encryption turned on end-2-end. That&#39;s why, when I was still a network engineer we decrypted at the SLB (ADC if you entered networking around 2006) - sent traffic through a FW/IDS/AMP (directly or call-out) - sent it back to the SLB/ADC and re-encrypted with a weaker cipher if needed or left it in clear if somehow possible. It&#39;s amazing how many designs I&#39;ve seen where TLS/SSL across a FW was deemed secure enough. Security is always a holistic affair and I&#39;m no security guy by any stretch of the imagination.",
