      "html": "Preamble: I have filled the survey.<br /><br />In my opinion that paper is full of wrong assumptions:<br />&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />1. &quot;Despite the fact that such a RS service eases the management of BGP sessions and facilitates peering, its usage is not widespread&quot;                                                                               <br />&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />That is not true, most (if not all) the IXPs that i am aware of have RSs and many of the participants connect to them.<br /><br />&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />2. &quot;One of the main barriers is that the export policy of each member must be revealed to the IXP in order to correctly forward the BGP announcements.&quot;<br />&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />There are tons of tools that can tell you who is announcing what and where. <br />Privacy is not really an issue.<br /><br />Most of the times you don&#39;t want to peer with the RS because that would cost you money. Either because you hope to be paid for peer/transit by the other peers or because peering will affect your ratio with the tier1/large-eyeball of choice<br /><br />Marco",
