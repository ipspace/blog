  html: 'We are using Ansible for network automation at Hostinger and we are happy
    with it. We tried to use Chef with Cumulus, but the effect was the same, because
    Cumulus&#39;s Chef version doesn&#39;t have support with chef-zero, only chef-solo,
    which is not compatible with chef-server together. I meant, that Ansible vs. Chef-solo
    is the same. We solved this running Ansible from Jenkins + Github. We push some
    changes (new BGP neigbors, change firewall rules, change bridge settings, etc.)
    in Github and Jenkins just runs Ansible on every change in Github. '

  html: The issue of configuration that exists outside of ZTP is very irritating.
    In Juniper-world, for example, virtual chassis configuration exists outside of
    the configuration - in Cisco parlance it is an enable command to enable VC, rather
    than a configuration command. Irritating as it means it is difficult to fully
    automate the build (although we have worked around it).

    html: Problem with &quot;central points&quot; can be solved by using distributed
      key/value stores, for e.g. Consul.

    html: Which is OK if you do it correctly, re my 2) above :)

  html: It is quite interesting seeing this discussion and knowing how my old self
    went through all the same when I started automating application server builds
    a long time ago.<br /><br />The real choice here, that you should spend some time
    thinking about, is whether you want your devices to be &quot;as capable of self-healing
    as possible&quot; or if you just don&#39;t care. No secret that I certainly DO
    care, I want all my parts of my infrastructure to be autonomous, if at all possible.
    Autonomy leads to greater certainty, and if there&#39;s one attribute you want
    inherent in your networks, it&#39;s certainty. http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920036289.do<br
    /><br />Backing up, if you are doing network automation because you need to solve
    problems you have _right now_, then something like Ansible using the push model
    is likely your only option. However, if you are designing future infrastructure
    networks choosing a model that builds on the autonomous actors pattern is a massive
    benefit. At smaller scales than you&#39;d think, is my experience.<br /><br />Puppet
    masters and chef servers mostly confuse people as it again strongly couples your
    devices to a central point, which you don&#39;t really want. Fix it by 1) Ship
    (most, if not all) your configuration out to every device and let agents converge
    devices to their known state 2) Use service discovery mechanisms for any runtime
    dynamic data<br /><br />There, saved you 100s of consulting hours, go make greatness
    :D

  html: Not *really* ZTP/router configuration, but.. Puppet doesn&#39;t need to have
    an agent installed on the node. <br /><br />Here&#39;s an example I dealt with
    just in the last few days that does exactly that - uses Puppet and a plug-in that
    uses REST to send config commands to apply configuration to a Brocade Virtual
    Traffic Manager with a bare-minimum configuration applied (has an IP, login/pass
    and REST enabled):<br /><br />https://github.com/dkalintsev/Brocade/tree/master/vADC/CloudFormation/Templates/Variants-and-experimental/Configured-by-Puppet<br
    /><br />In this example, I have a server that&#39;s external to the vTM being
    configured, where I inject parameters into a Puppet manifest, including the target
    node config (IP, login/pass), and then run &quot;puppet apply &quot; to push it,
    as opposed to more traditional &quot;pull&quot;. There&#39;s no puppet installed
    on the vTM - it simply gets API calls.<br /><br />I&#39;m guessing a similar approach
    should probably work just fine with some router with NETCONF over ssh or something.
