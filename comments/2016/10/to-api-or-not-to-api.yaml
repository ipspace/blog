  html: The remainder of the original comment rephrased here was,&quot;...Something
    like Ansible could be the &#39;API broker&#39; for higher level workflow tools,
    to interact with the services on that platform....&quot;<br /><br />Given the
    context of this extended comment, I think I may have to disagree and assert that
    an API (or something like it) should be required. (Maybe I&#39;m just misunderstanding
    the &quot;open&quot; vs &quot;closed&quot; system piece?)<br /><br />Driverless
    vehicles come to mind. As ain initial POC, maybe the steering wheel, accelerator,
    brakes, and gear selectors are fitted with clunky &quot;sticks and servos&quot;,
    engineered to dial in just the right combination of kinetic output to command
    the vehicle. In practice, however, such modifications would be more tightly integrated
    with the underlying controlling mechanisms, instead of struggling to control the
    abstractions.<br /><br />While something like Ansible as an &quot;API broker&quot;
    might be a feasible short- to mid-term solution, might we not be incurring more
    technical debt in the future by being so loose on the standards requirements in
    the present?

    html: 'NETCONF is API (actually the session layer). API != HTTP (REST).<br /><br
      />As for what NETCONF really is: http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/06/netconf-expect-on-steroids.html.
      The data models are slowly being implemented by some vendors (see http://blog.ipspace.net/2016/10/network-automation-rfp-requirements.html)<br
      /><br />It&#39;s about time the networking engineers wake up and realize NETCONF+YANG
      is not an aspirin.'

  html: Hi! Why don&#39;t you like NETCONF so? It&#39;s standard protocol, but API
    is like SNMP MIB. Every vendor does it like it&#39;s want. Am I right?
