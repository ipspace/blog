    html: Totally agree about reboot tests. What does Netflix by creating random failures
      is even better. But this can be a real challenge with databases and any software
      that need manual resync/downtime for recovery.<br /><br />The issue is that
      most people don&#39;t get that it costs something, and are not ready to pay
      for regular tests.<br />

  html: 'Proper deployment design and operations could make the difference. The trick
    with clusters is preventive maintenance. You have to exercise the reboot of cluster
    members regularly. This could reduce your risk significantly.<br /><br />The measure
    of success is not the up-time of a server! :-) It is the reliability of the real
    services.<br />As an auditor, if I see a long up-time clustered server, I would
    be immediately suspicious, that this organization has a bad operational practice.
    :-)<br /><br />Of course, if you have basic bugs in the cluster software, nothing
    could help out... '

  html: As far as firewall goes my experience is that a cluster is not less stable
    if I account for the environment of the customers.<br /><br />The networks on
    single firewall sis mostly less complex. And a good failover setup can in fact
    kee a firewall cluster alive where a single firewall would have an outage due
    to the reboot required to fix issues.<br /><br />My main experience is with Check
    Point firewalls but there I found that a good firewall cluster will save the day.<br
    /><br />As always poor management is something a cluster won&#39;t protect you
    against.<br />

  html: In my opinion there is some thruth in the foregoing statement that clustered
    systems will fail more often than standalone ones. This is based on the fact,
    that complexity is one factor causing a higher probability of failure.<br /><br
    />But we have to differentiate a bit, as allways when our statements are based
    more on feelings than on mesurement.<br /><br />In the past we had to deal with
    a series of decayed software - as well in Switches or Router plattformas as in
    Firewall systems. And especially on Firewall systems the possibility to do an
    upgrade at runtime was a good thing, for we had not to plan doing the work at
    off-times.

    html: It&#39;s still true in the latest version (6). Sure, the ESXi itself doesn&#39;t
      crash anymore since the release 5 when there is a storage issue.<br /><br />But
      the webservice that allows the vCenter to discuss with the hypervisor will freeze
      until the failing paths are removed (meaning you don&#39;t have any partial
      failure, with input/output error for instance).<br /><br />With the webservice
      being unresponsive, you lose the ability to migrate your VM. And if you forgot
      to enable SSH, your host won&#39;t be reachable until you solve the storage
      issue. If you stop a VM, or a VM crashes, you then won&#39;t be able to restart
      it even if the data is not on a datastore affected by the issue.<br /><br />Even
      the tech guys from VMWare admit there is still a lot of improvements to be done
      in this area.<br />

  html: 'not sure which version of vSphere is being referred to, but with APD and
    PDL handling those problems seem to be an issue of the past. With APD handling
    we fast fail IOs so you won&#39;t hit that issue any longer, I think that was
    introduced in vSphere 5.1 even. '
