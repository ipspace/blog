  html: Some blue sky thinking... BGP-LU AF between border routers, redistribute IGP
    into BGP-LU (loopbacks only) and set AIGP attribute. Would need to advertise labelled
    VPN routes also (assume it is option A now).

    global table though.<br /><br />http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_bgp/configuration/15-s/irg-15-s-book/bgp-accumulated-igp.html

  html: You could use ExaBGP as SDN controller, but you will need some coding to extend
    to this functionality :)

    html: It might work for Inter-As Option B as well.

  html: Dear,<br /><br />If you are using Inter-AS Option A between ASes, you can
    try to change route-type for all prefixes advertised from A1 to C1 via eBGP from
    EGP to IGP ( Origin = IGP). I had similar task for Huawei routers and it&#39;s
    works fine. Create a route-map and apply it eBGP neighbor at export direction.

  html: It is my understanding that in Cisco IOS, the MED sent to an eBGP peer is
    derived from the IGP metric by default.

  html: "I&#39;ve stumbled across a similar issue / demand some time ago:<br />As\
    \ already pointed out, MED or BGP Accumulated IGP might be an option, but that\
    \ greatly depends on the boxes and their operating systems that are in place right\
    \ now.<br />With Junos, I believe you have the option to copy the IGP costs into\
    \ MED through a route-policy but they don\u2019t support BGP A-IGP for VPN (yet),\
    \ I think.<br />In the current IOS-XR and IOS XE releases, BGP A-IGP should be\
    \ supported, also for VPN whereas there is no way to copy the IGP metric into\
    \ MED up to now.<br /><br />Some kind of an overlay through the core network might\
    \ also be an option but that might not scale, depending on the size of the network.<br\
    \ />"

  html: 'Without know the protocol running at the core interlinks I would suggest
    using summarization. For example A1 would advertise specific prefixes for E1 but
    A2 and A3 would only advertise a larger summary for those prefixes this techniques
    should be protocol agnostic and thus resulting in choosing the path advertising
    the most specific prefix but retaining the failover properties. '

  html: I&#39;m making some assumptions here based on the diagram, requirements and
    limitations, one assumption is that there is an iBGP full mesh with the IGP as
    an underlay as transport for the iBGP sessions, vpnv4 AF is used between E and
    A devices in the access network? The A devices therefore have peerings to all
    other A devices and E devices? If so this should be simple, create session templates
    on all A devices, 1 for peerings to E and 1 for peerings to Other A, for A peer
    group set all to a higher MED and for E peer set all to a lower, all NLRI will
    be in adj-rib-in but only those with lower MED will be in loc-rib and therefore
    only the path direct to E devices will go into adj-rib-out to be advertised to
    the C devices, this will mean that the NLRI that the C devices receive are only
    the ones for direct A to E paths(unless there is a failure) this removes the need
    for the C devices to support MED which is optional-non transitive anyway. That&#39;s
    the simplest way I can think of without more detail and having labbed this up!
