    html: Agree (added EVPN to the list of technologies doing that). However, that&#39;s
      misusing L2 address resolution protocol as a host reachability protocol. Bad
      form.

    html: I view ISIS and ESIS as 2 totally different protocols.<br /><br />So people
      don&#39;t like OSPF on their hosts. One reason is that you don&#39;t want your
      host to become a transit-hop in your network. I am sure there will always be
      some weird corner-cases where a partitioned network will try to route through
      a host, if it sees the opportunity. Any other reasons ?<br /><br />If the &quot;risk
      of having your host act as a transit router&quot; is your biggest fear, then
      ISIS might be a good alternative over OSPF. ISIS has the &quot;overload-bit&quot;.
      This bit was intended to be used when a router runs out of memory. By setting
      the overload-bit, all other routers in the network will know that this router&#39;s
      RIB and FIB can not be trusted anymore. And therefor they will router traffic
      around that failing router.<br /><br />So a host could run ISIS and always set
      the overload bit. The host would see all prefixes in the network. The host can
      advertise just its own ip-address. Without any risk that the host would ever
      be used for transit. OSPF can&#39;t do that. (Setting all metrics to MAX_METRIC
      wouldn&#39;t do the trick).<br /><br />Still, I think someone should do a proper
      ESIS version for IPv4 and IPv6. To replace IPv6-ND. And so we can get rid of
      VRRP/HSRP, redistribute-arp, running routing protocols on hosts, and a bunch
      of other kludges.

  html: with EVPN (even on vxlan) the local hosts for which vtep has identified the
    IP address via arp or dhcp can be redistribute in BGP as type-5 host-route. Combining
    this feature with evpn mac-mobility you can get fast convergent on IP migrations
    also among different data centers.

  html: Speaking of the OL bit has its uses. I used it exclusively in a Fabricpath
    design a couple of years back for  traffic control when needed but primarily for
    maintenance uses. Created an ops menu in NXOS so the ops, with one key, can put
    the switch into OL, FP routes around it, no impact to users activity(heavily tested)
    and the ops can work on the switch.  Very fast. ISIS has some interesting knobs.<br

  html: Ivan, Ivan...your question about EIGRP feasibility successor made me laugh.
    I am referring to Pierres&#39;s warble in EuroNOG - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFm4gPKo9RE.<br
