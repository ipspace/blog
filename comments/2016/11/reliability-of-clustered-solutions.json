But this can be a real challenge with databases and any software that need manual resync/downtime for recovery.<br /><br />The issue is that most people don&#39;t get that it costs something, and are not ready to pay for regular tests.<br />",

      "html": "Proper deployment design and operations could make the difference. The trick with clusters is preventive maintenance. You have to exercise the reboot of cluster members regularly. This could reduce your risk significantly.<br /><br />The measure of success is not the up-time of a server! :-) It is the reliability of the real services.<br />As an auditor, if I see a long up-time clustered server, I would be immediately suspicious, that this organization has a bad operational practice. :-)<br /><br />Of course, if you have basic bugs in the cluster software, nothing could help out...

And a good failover setup can in fact kee a firewall cluster alive where a single firewall would have an outage due to the reboot required to fix issues.<br /><br />My main experience is with Check Point firewalls but there I found that a good firewall cluster will save the day.<br /><br />As always poor management is something a cluster won&#39;t protect you against.<br />",

      "html": "In my opinion there is some thruth in the foregoing statement that clustered systems will fail more often than standalone ones. This is based on the fact, that complexity is one factor causing a higher probability of failure.<br /><br />But we have to differentiate a bit, as allways when our statements are based more on feelings than on mesurement.<br /><br />In the past we had to deal with a series of decayed software - as well in Switches or Router plattformas as in Firewall systems. And especially on Firewall systems the possibility to do an upgrade at runtime was a good thing, for we had not to plan doing the work at off-times.",

          "html": "It&#39;s still true in the latest version (6). Sure, the ESXi itself doesn&#39;t crash anymore since the release 5 when there is a storage issue.<br /><br />But the webservice that allows the vCenter to discuss with the hypervisor will freeze until the failing paths are removed (meaning you don&#39;t have any partial failure, with input/output error for instance).<br /><br />With the webservice being unresponsive, you lose the ability to migrate your VM. And if you forgot to enable SSH, your host won&#39;t be reachable until you solve the storage issue. If you stop a VM, or a VM crashes, you then won&#39;t be able to restart it even if the data is not on a datastore affected by the issue.<br /><br />Even the tech guys from VMWare admit there is still a lot of improvements to be done in this area.<br />",
