            <div class="comment-content">Ivan, the whole networking community knows you for your immense knowledge, great webinars, vendor neutrality and I love your &quot;shipping features not futures&quot; mantra. I am glad you set the record straight anyways, but, I think you can safely ignore the ignorant anonymous commentators - probably 99% of your readers/subscribers know better :)<br /><br />BTW, I always thought that the sponsored webinars were also awesome (VMware NSX and Cummulus come to mind), in addition to your regular webinars. You have always been very transparent about them being &quot;sponsored&quot;. <br /><br />I would vote for you to continue them, with the same transparency. <br />Many of the past sponsored webinars were of great quality and had great content. I would love to see webinars similar to NSX webinar for the following technologies: Cisco ACI, Arista CloudVision, and HPE VAN SDN Controller.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Some people and vendors might not realize this but building a community around your product is important. Cisco did a great job with that 10-15 years ago with awesome documentation and materials but then they got greedy and disconnected from their customer base. Building a community and convincing people that their product is great (rather than &quot;sponsoring&quot; bloggers) should be more important than marketing.</div>
