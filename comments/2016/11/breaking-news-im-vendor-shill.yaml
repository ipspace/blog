  html: 'Ivan, the whole networking community knows you for your immense knowledge,
    great webinars, vendor neutrality and I love your &quot;shipping features not
    futures&quot; mantra. I am glad you set the record straight anyways, but, I think
    you can safely ignore the ignorant anonymous commentators - probably 99% of your
    readers/subscribers know better :)<br /><br />BTW, I always thought that the sponsored
    webinars were also awesome (VMware NSX and Cummulus come to mind), in addition
    to your regular webinars. You have always been very transparent about them being
    &quot;sponsored&quot;. <br /><br />I would vote for you to continue them, with
    the same transparency. <br />Many of the past sponsored webinars were of great
    quality and had great content. I would love to see webinars similar to NSX webinar
    for the following technologies: Cisco ACI, Arista CloudVision, and HPE VAN SDN
    Controller.'

  html: Some people and vendors might not realize this but building a community around
    your product is important. Cisco did a great job with that 10-15 years ago with
    awesome documentation and materials but then they got greedy and disconnected
    from their customer base. Building a community and convincing people that their
    product is great (rather than &quot;sponsoring&quot; bloggers) should be more
    important than marketing.

  html: This was quite an entertaining read. A shill you are not. You certainly keep
    me on my toes and I&#39;m always proud to be associated with you. Nice response.
