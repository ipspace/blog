          "html": "I view ISIS and ESIS as 2 totally different protocols.<br /><br />So people don&#39;t like OSPF on their hosts. One reason is that you don&#39;t want your host to become a transit-hop in your network. I am sure there will always be some weird corner-cases where a partitioned network will try to route through a host, if it sees the opportunity. Any other reasons ?<br /><br />If the &quot;risk of having your host act as a transit router&quot; is your biggest fear, then ISIS might be a good alternative over OSPF. ISIS has the &quot;overload-bit&quot;. This bit was intended to be used when a router runs out of memory. By setting the overload-bit, all other routers in the network will know that this router&#39;s RIB and FIB can not be trusted anymore. And therefor they will router traffic around that failing router.<br /><br />So a host could run ISIS and always set the overload bit. The host would see all prefixes in the network. The host can advertise just its own ip-address. Without any risk that the host would ever be used for transit. OSPF can&#39;t do that. (Setting all metrics to MAX_METRIC wouldn&#39;t do the trick).<br /><br />Still, I think someone should do a proper ESIS version for IPv4 and IPv6. To replace IPv6-ND. And so we can get rid of VRRP/HSRP, redistribute-arp, running routing protocols on hosts, and a bunch of other kludges.",

      "html": "Speaking of the OL bit has its uses. I used it exclusively in a Fabricpath design a couple of years back for  traffic control when needed but primarily for maintenance uses. Created an ops menu in NXOS so the ops, with one key, can put the switch into OL, FP routes around it, no impact to users activity(heavily tested) and the ops can work on the switch.  Very fast. ISIS has some interesting knobs.<br /><br /><br /><br />",
