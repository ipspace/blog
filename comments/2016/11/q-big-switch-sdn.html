            <div class="comment-content">van,<br />When I look at opennetworking.org and or sdncentral I see SO many many vendors. Is there that much of &quot;SDN&quot; buy in happening ie in terms of business? All of them seem to have active customer use cases etc...What am I missing? Second question (more of a comment) is not matter how smart, organized or resourceful, I doubt anyone has the ability to compare contrast so many. Is there that big of a gap with current supply and demand (of features I guess) that justifies this? For context sake, I&#39;m at a VAR in NYC, in the industry for 25+ years, technical, have attended a lot of your SDN seminars incl one in Miami(maybe I was on a bio break when you may have been explaining this madness)...so by no means a novice. This just intrigues me.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Short answer: No. Most of that is marketing and posturing. Like with ATM in the old days, most of SDN is still a zero trillion dollar business.<br /><br />I know of several NSO deployments and a few NSX and ACI deployments. Supposedly people are deploying Contrail, Nuage VSP and SD-WAN. Beyond that? Not really.</div>
