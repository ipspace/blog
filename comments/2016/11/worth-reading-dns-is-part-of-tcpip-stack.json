      "html": "1980? Too early, a large telco was using /etc/hosts file on a Solaris box to do name resolution for their network mgmt devices, inthe high hundreds of devices back in 2003. I left in 2003 so dont know if its still the case. At least they were using RCS for versioning the file. My lack of proficiency with vi/vim and rcs resulted in me deleting a large number of entries and committing the changes. Yikes the HP Openview lit up. Took me 15 minutes to man rcs and figure out how to recover the previous version. Hindsight says DNS is better.",
