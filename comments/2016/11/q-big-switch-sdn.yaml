  html: van,<br />When I look at opennetworking.org and or sdncentral I see SO many
    many vendors. Is there that much of &quot;SDN&quot; buy in happening ie in terms
    of business? All of them seem to have active customer use cases etc...What am
    I missing? Second question (more of a comment) is not matter how smart, organized
    or resourceful, I doubt anyone has the ability to compare contrast so many. Is
    there that big of a gap with current supply and demand (of features I guess) that
    justifies this? For context sake, I&#39;m at a VAR in NYC, in the industry for
    25+ years, technical, have attended a lot of your SDN seminars incl one in Miami(maybe
    I was on a bio break when you may have been explaining this madness)...so by no
    means a novice. This just intrigues me.

  html: 'Short answer: No. Most of that is marketing and posturing. Like with ATM
    in the old days, most of SDN is still a zero trillion dollar business.<br /><br
    />I know of several NSO deployments and a few NSX and ACI deployments. Supposedly
    people are deploying Contrail, Nuage VSP and SD-WAN. Beyond that? Not really.'
