Frankly its harder to find and keep premium people than it is to choose and install pretty-decent $vendor_product.<br /><br />The advantages $vendor_product have are their relatively consistent quality and their infinite scale.  For most businesses, that&#39;s an easier and more sensible trajectory than trying to gather up all the unicorns and have them build the rainbow palace.<br />",

      "html": "+1 to Jason comment.<br /><br />It is great to work with &quot;premium people&quot;. I had a pleasure to work with such individuals. I like this kind of work. But on the other hand, people management is usually much harder than management of technologies. Especially commoditized  technologies. That&#39;s the main reason for generalization, abstraction, virtualization, automation which leads to commoditization and usage simplification. Of course, all this leads to bigger complexity under the cover therefore if customer does not have competency for it then he has just two options. <br /><br />1/ investment into vendor&#39;s products developed and supported by their &quot;premium people&quot; or <br />2/ buy IT products as a services. That&#39;s actually what cloud services means for me. <br /><br />&quot;Premium people&quot; is limited resource thus these people will work mainly for vendors or service providers. <br /><br />Therefore non-IT companies, in my humble opinion, will have to rely on technology vendors or service providers. Investment into &quot;premium people&quot; must be calculated in TCO and ROI and only ROI can prove if such investment makes sense.  <br /><br />Just my $0.02.",
