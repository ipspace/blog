      "html": "I&#39;m making some assumptions here based on the diagram, requirements and limitations, one assumption is that there is an iBGP full mesh with the IGP as an underlay as transport for the iBGP sessions, vpnv4 AF is used between E and A devices in the access network? The A devices therefore have peerings to all other A devices and E devices? If so this should be simple, create session templates on all A devices, 1 for peerings to E and 1 for peerings to Other A, for A peer group set all to a higher MED and for E peer set all to a lower, all NLRI will be in adj-rib-in but only those with lower MED will be in loc-rib and therefore only the path direct to E devices will go into adj-rib-out to be advertised to the C devices, this will mean that the NLRI that the C devices receive are only the ones for direct A to E paths(unless there is a failure) this removes the need for the C devices to support MED which is optional-non transitive anyway. That&#39;s the simplest way I can think of without more detail and having labbed this up!",
