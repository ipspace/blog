  html: HA!  When I started this job last year, I was told to create entries in the
    hosts file on a Windows box.  The person who told me to do it had a straight face
    the entire time.

  html: 1980? Too early, a large telco was using /etc/hosts file on a Solaris box
    to do name resolution for their network mgmt devices, inthe high hundreds of devices
    back in 2003. I left in 2003 so dont know if its still the case. At least they
    were using RCS for versioning the file. My lack of proficiency with vi/vim and
    rcs resulted in me deleting a large number of entries and committing the changes.
    Yikes the HP Openview lit up. Took me 15 minutes to man rcs and figure out how
    to recover the previous version. Hindsight says DNS is better.

  html: "Amen to that.<br />One thing that rang true to me from the post is the mention\
    \ of the \u201Cit could take up to 24 hours for DNS information to propagate\u201D\
    \ complain that we have to keep hearing. Ever heard of fastflux and DGAs in botnets\
    \ and malware? "
