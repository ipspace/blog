      "html": "Ivan, that perfectly matches my observations. By the way, Juniper also mentions that Session Hijacking is an &quot;esoteric&quot; attack vector at the moment - http://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&amp;id=KB5814&amp;actp=search  <br /><br />Actually, there is a study at University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) - http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zhiyunq/pub/oakland12_TCP_sequence_number_inference.pdf - that explains how one can actually detect the current sequence range if firewall drops out of sequence packets. <br /><br />On a side note, quite a few antiDDoS vendors use out-of-sequence TCP packet to check if the host is spoofed or not. And that works quite good comparing to traditional SYN cookie challenge.",

If your middlebox OS has been raising red flags in `nmap -O` and lagging behind multiple open source network OS for a whole decade now, you should do the community a favour and tell us who *not* to buy :).",
