  html: I&#39;m also very interested to hear your take on the layer-3 routing within
    Cisco&#39;s EVPN+VXLAN topology, as it&#39;s one of the few designs I know of
    that can give us L3VPN-like capabilities on top of a VXLAN data plane. <br /><br
    />It&#39;s seems to be even more interesting when combined with their slimmed
    down version of Tail-f NCS for overlay network provisioning which they call Virtual
    Topology System. I&#39;ve been playing with it in the lab, and it solves the issue
    of maintaining consistent configuration and VNI/VLAN management across the local
    fabric.
