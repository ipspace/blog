            <div class="comment-content">I was sat, nineteen years old looking after the large archives of a law firm, one day a new IT Manager started, as I knew the archive system better than most (which also included the accounts package) I got offered a modest payrise and a job as a IT Technician (read helpdesk) and a chance to get some career progression and maybe one day be a manager...<br /><br />That was seventeen years ago,  sixteen of those ive spent dodging anything management related.<br /><br />Ive been helpdesk, sysadmin, and network engineer, im currently European Administrator and I couldn&#39;t be happier, the nineteen year old who struggled to get a job anywhere wouldn&#39;t believe me if I could talk to him, networking has been a wonderful career for me.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">You stumble upon something and you&#39;re fascinated by it. Then it&#39;s years of working with it, some day critical mass of knowledge is accumulated, and suddenly you know more about some topic than people around you.<br /><br />If it was networking then you just became a network engineer :-)<br /><br />It&#39;s that simple.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">i love the &quot;four yorkshiremen&quot; reference, i&#39;d love to see a script written for network engineers based on that. &quot;Frame relay? in my day we could only dream of frame relay, we had x.25 and were thankful for it&quot;</div>

            <div class="comment-content">X.25? You were lucky if you could get X.25 and it was way too expensive anyway. All we had was a 300 bps async line that was so slow the host couldn&#39;t even echo the characters in real time.<br /><br />(* BTW, all of the above is real - based on what I had in ~1980 *)</div>
