      "html": "I totally agree with you Ivan. Also I believe that with a reliable design plus what you called automation magic, there won&#39;t be any complexity.<br />This even might be helpful when connecting the DC block to the Core and having data transfer with WAN. Besides, nowadays more Enterprises are becoming SPs and using BGP as the Core routing protocol.<br />The level of granularity and traffic engineering is incredible.<br />The only drawback I see is the staff the knowledge in BGP area; though they can be educated in that too, hence at the end of the day they want to be Network engineers!<br /><br />And of course we know that it&#39;s not for everywhere and business needs should be taken into account.<br /><br />Looking forward to the webinar today.",

Link state probably made sense when fabric is asymmetric interms of different ecmps, link-speeds etc. With symmetric fabric where all things equal with leaf-spine arch, does it make sense for a node to know every bit of fabric info or just reach-ability is suffice ?.<br /><br />As far as tooling is concerned, BGP/OSPF/ISIS have been developed organically based on their role in the network, so can we can always achieve what one is not intended to be.",

      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Due to the limitation of BGP not being able to use unnumbered interfaces we must use tricks. It is an interesting trick using the IPv6 Link local address for peering proposed by Cumulus.<br /><br />My question is: having Nexus switches as spine and leaf, N9K, why we couldn\u2019t use a single SVI on each switch where all the SVIs are in the same subnet and the fabric ports being used as access switchports for the SVI vlan. BGP peerings will be done through the SVI IP addresses and only 1 IPv4 address per device would be used.<br />Why this would not be a suitable solution as a Nexus switch can act as a layer 3 and layer 2 interface on the same port?<br /><br />Thanks.<br />",
