  html: I would say that the answer &#39;No&#39; for &quot;Are Convergence Speeds
    Different?&quot; is too short. In the case of EIGRP we may have the flooding-computing-and-propagating
    scheme by sending queries which extends convergence time. It is less visible in
    Data Center but in large domains it makes a difference.<br /><br />Apart from
    that not all dampening timers can be tuned in BGP to as a low level as it is possible
    for link-state protocols. In theory it could be but there are some race conditions
    when BGP can miss its triggered compute time and can wait an another 60 seconds.
    Unless the network is built on BGP IPv4 AFI only and there is no protocol dependencies
    and a network vendor allows for subsecond tunning. But agree that for large Data
    Centers the most significant factor is the prefix insertion into FIB. There is
    no need to fight for every 50 ms.

  html: We use BGP internally on both the Core and Backbone. (We are a moderately
    large enterprise). The backbone is a simple L3-MPLS-VPN so that we can segregate
    types of traffic traveling between physical locations without needing to firewall
    (i.e., Dev, Test, Production, Fin, etc...). BGP also extends to every distribution
    layer that feeds reachability back to the backbone. There are localized pods of
    OSPF within certain distribution points but that was due to limited support for
    BGP by some legacy devices in these environments. Additionally, the default route
    from our carriers (also BGP peered out at the edge) is extended down into the
    backbone. There was some concern by operational staff in the beginning, but we
    strived to keep things very simple, no advanced knob-fiddling. Local-pref for
    some simple manipulation and it&#39;s been great.<br /><br />In regards to ACI:<br

  html: For flowlets packets, CONGO changes the flow to a different path at ToR/Spine
    based on latency metric. It uses VxLAN to abstract out topology between ToRs/Spines
    but still uses feedback mechanism for latency which is still a function of topology.<br

    html: I think that whenever I used the word &quot;slow&quot; in this article,
      the verb close to it was in past tense.<br /><br />Contrary to some SDN evangelists
      I believe in learning from history and past mistakes, and if you want to do
      that, you have to know it/them first.

  html: Thanks Ivan.  Your informed opinion is appreciated as always.<br /><br />Do
    you think that RIFT is barking up the right tree?<br /><br />https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-przygienda-rift-02
