      "html": "I love link-state protcols. I love BGP. But somebody please explain to me why we have to carry LS-information inside BGP ?<br /><br />I like simple. I like section 2.12 if rfc1925. A few months ago Ivan made a post about &quot;lego blocks&quot;. How technology should not all be inter-woven. It should be made separate independent blocks, which can be combined freely by the user.<br /><br />BGP-LS is the opposite. It makes things more complex. Link-state protocols, and also BGP, are not simple concepts. (Try explain a linkstate protocol to your mother). Building good implementations is even harder. Simplicity helps. Complexity makes everything harder.<br /><br />The easy and simple solution would have been to just throw all the info into a TCP-connection between a router and the controller. Done. The functionality will look very similar to BGP-LS. But simpler. Can be done independent of BGP. No need to mess with new attributes, etc. Why not take the simple route ?<br /><br />Look at BGP Monitoring Protocol. Very similar. You dump a bunch of routing information to a controller. That could have been done over BGP. But the BGP-guys themselves decided that that was overly complex. So they made BMP. Just open a TCP connection, uni-directional, and dump the routing information in a simple format. No need to mess up BGP even more.<br /><br />So why ?<br />Why can&#39;t you just dump the LSDB over a TCP connection ?<br />Why do it over BGP ?<br />Is there any real benefit ?<br />Why ?",

      "html": "BGP-LS isn&#39;t really that complicated.  BMP in mirror mode is very simple on the router end, but the monitoring mode still packs normal BGP updates into a BMP header.  The receiver end still has to process and figure out what to do with the data, BGP-LS is no different.   Sure you have the BGP state machine and other things to deal with but the reality is BGP-LS is fairly widely implemented already.  <br /><br />A better and more modern solution is just have a RESTCONF based subscription to the router and get topology data (and lots of other things) through that.  There is a specific draft on accessing YANG-based data via an async subscription, making it very flexible.   OpenDaylight for instance allows you to do this today, you subscribe to a specific asynchronous topology stream to get topology and updates.    However the first BGP-LS draft was a long long time ago at this point.  ",
