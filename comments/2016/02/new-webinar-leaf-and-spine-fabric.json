      "html": "I&#39;m also very interested to hear your take on the layer-3 routing within Cisco&#39;s EVPN+VXLAN topology, as it&#39;s one of the few designs I know of that can give us L3VPN-like capabilities on top of a VXLAN data plane. <br /><br />It&#39;s seems to be even more interesting when combined with their slimmed down version of Tail-f NCS for overlay network provisioning which they call Virtual Topology System. I&#39;ve been playing with it in the lab, and it solves the issue of maintaining consistent configuration and VNI/VLAN management across the local fabric.",
