      Without that answer it&#39;s just another hefty dose of Kool-Aid.'

  html: It will make more sense once you will have segment routing available in your
    WAN. Then your controller will rely on BGP-LS and PCEP and it will insert source
    routes using segment IDs. <br />

  html: Let&#39;s put the definitions right:<br />PCEP is - Path Computation Element
    (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path Computation
    Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between two PCEs. It is not limited to TE only!<br
    />The role of PCEP is to provide bidirectional communication channel between client
    and server with well defined semantics, negotiated features, etc<br />We are also
    extending PCEP to provide a more generic container to trigger an action and/or
    pass some opaque data, take a look at draft-sivabalan-pce-policy-identifier.<br
    /><br />Let&#39;s move to SDN world :)<br />The role of a  network (SDN) controller
    is to take business logic NB and transform it into networking instantiated over
    variety of SBI&#39;s (no, not OF only ;-))<br />PCE computation result is the
    product of:<br />complete topology graph with all the attributes, this is were
    stateful PCE and BGP-LS come into play with business logic, represented as set
    of constrains applied to.<br />It doesn&#39;t have to be directly relevant to
    traditional TE, weather forecast for mW, cost in $$ for a capacity broker, etc<br
    /><br />PCEP is a rather good candidate for a SBI, to create/modify an ephemeral
    state, provide telemetry (reports), many other... This is the reason it has been
    implemented in ODL day 1<br /><br />IETF stuff to look up:<br />RFC5440<br />draft-sivabalan-pce-policy-identifier<br
    />draft-pkd-pce-pcep-yang<br />draft-ietf-pce-stateful-pce<br /><br />If you are
    interested in SR:<br />draft-ietf-pce-segment-routing<br /><br />Leg me know if
    there are any questions<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Jeff

    html: Hi Phil,<br />Well, so, could you give some use case examples? I still cant
      clear see how/why using it and I am very interested in knowing more :)

    html: You might want to attend Segment Routing webinar, Thursday, May 26th 12:00
      EDT. I&#39;ll be touching upon PCEP role in SDN ecosystem

  html: 'Jeff hit the nail on the head, PCEP is just a SB communication protocol,
    so asking a question like &quot;Is there a use case for PCEP?&quot; is like saying
    &quot;Is there a use case for HTTP?&quot;   Plenty of large networks for years
    have used  cumbersome mechanisms to accomplish what PCEP (and its associated extensions)
    can accomplish in a  standardized way.  I could give you a laundry list of useful
    applications (not BoD) I&#39;ll never see in distributed embedded router software
    but can be easily implemented in software.  Those could use PCEP or not, but PCEP
    IMHO is the best avenue especially if you are running an existing RSVP-TE network.  <br
    /><br />As an example, we have done modeling on our network to show how it can
    be made more efficient using global concurrent optimization, and while it&#39;s
    not mind blowing, there is a difference.    '
