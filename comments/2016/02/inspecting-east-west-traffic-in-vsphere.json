      "html": "Hi,<br /><br />This is a problem today. I think vmware needs to go to a license model where you can do microsegmentation without the overlay stuff.<br />Create two licenses: 1 for microsegmentation (you don&#39;t need the controller and stuff) and 1 for the compleet package (with overlay VXLAN capabilities).<br /><br />For now it isn&#39;t possible and you need to buy the compleet package. <br /><br />There are other solutions that can do microsegmentation without NXS (NetX API): https://www.varmour.com (but this isn&#39;t cheap also, so no solution for your size)<br /><br />GreetZ,<br />Frac",
