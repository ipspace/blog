  html: I was sat, nineteen years old looking after the large archives of a law firm,
    one day a new IT Manager started, as I knew the archive system better than most
    (which also included the accounts package) I got offered a modest payrise and
    a job as a IT Technician (read helpdesk) and a chance to get some career progression
    and maybe one day be a manager...<br /><br />That was seventeen years ago,  sixteen
    of those ive spent dodging anything management related.<br /><br />Ive been helpdesk,
    sysadmin, and network engineer, im currently European Administrator and I couldn&#39;t
    be happier, the nineteen year old who struggled to get a job anywhere wouldn&#39;t
    believe me if I could talk to him, networking has been a wonderful career for
    me.

  html: You stumble upon something and you&#39;re fascinated by it. Then it&#39;s
    years of working with it, some day critical mass of knowledge is accumulated,
    and suddenly you know more about some topic than people around you.<br /><br />If
    it was networking then you just became a network engineer :-)<br /><br />It&#39;s
    that simple.

  html: I was fixing printers at a small office machine company. My boss said he would
    give me a $10k raise if I learned Novell and passed CNA. That lead to routing/switching
    work.

    html: X.25? You were lucky if you could get X.25 and it was way too expensive
      anyway. All we had was a 300 bps async line that was so slow the host couldn&#39;t
      even echo the characters in real time.<br /><br />(* BTW, all of the above is
      real - based on what I had in ~1980 *)

  html: i love the &quot;four yorkshiremen&quot; reference, i&#39;d love to see a
    script written for network engineers based on that. &quot;Frame relay? in my day
    we could only dream of frame relay, we had x.25 and were thankful for it&quot;
