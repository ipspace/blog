  html: Ivan, that perfectly matches my observations. By the way, Juniper also mentions
    that Session Hijacking is an &quot;esoteric&quot; attack vector at the moment
    - http://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&amp;id=KB5814&amp;actp=search  <br
    /><br />Actually, there is a study at University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) - http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zhiyunq/pub/oakland12_TCP_sequence_number_inference.pdf
    - that explains how one can actually detect the current sequence range if firewall
    drops out of sequence packets. <br /><br />On a side note, quite a few antiDDoS
    vendors use out-of-sequence TCP packet to check if the host is spoofed or not.
    And that works quite good comparing to traditional SYN cookie challenge.

  html: 'For those wondering how on earth the michigan study works: it relies on information
    leakage from IPIDs.  Alledgedly it&#39;s common in middlebox OS&#39;s.  If your
    middlebox OS has been raising red flags in `nmap -O` and lagging behind multiple
    open source network OS for a whole decade now, you should do the community a favour
    and tell us who *not* to buy :).'

  html: Thanks for introduce the Fernando, Eric Vyncke and Enno Rey&#39; work, I didn&#39;t
    know. Great post.

  html: 'Re: the point that modern TCP stacks &quot;should be&quot; hardened against
    this, there&#39;s recent measurements on this against production web servers:
    https://www.caida.org/~mjl/pubs/blind.pdf<br /><br />Key quote:<br /><br />In
    this population as measured in September 2015, we found: (1) 38.4% of systems
    tested were vulnerable to at least one blind in-window attack; (2) the in-window
    data attack is the most significant vulnerability, as 29.6% of systems accepted
    data with inadequate validation of the acknowledgment number; (3) systems that
    advertised a maximum segment size (MSS) of 1380 were almost never vulnerable to
    in-window reset and SYN packets (suggesting that middleboxes with this feature
    correctly filtered those suspicious packets) but incorrectly passed invalid in-window
    data packets, (4) in response to an in-window SYN, 1.1% of hosts established a
    parallel TCP connection using the same 4-tuple, which is unexpected behavior as
    a 4-tuple can only support a single TCP connection at any one time.<br />'

    html: NSX Distributed Firewall (which started the whole thread). Not sure what
      iptables do.

    html: NSX Distributed Firewall does track tcp sequence numbers. (FYI, im with
      the NSX Technical Product Management team.)

  html: Are there any stateful firewalls that dont track tcp seq number? Or give you
    the ability to turn the feature off?

  html: iptables checks sequence numbers.  It can be turned off with ip_ct_tcp_be_liberal.  Unfortunately
    there&#39;s very few reasons to turn it off, because I think it still incurs the
    tracking overhead, you&#39;re just disabling the enforcement.
