      "html": "I would say that the answer &#39;No&#39; for &quot;Are Convergence Speeds Different?&quot; is too short. In the case of EIGRP we may have the flooding-computing-and-propagating scheme by sending queries which extends convergence time. It is less visible in Data Center but in large domains it makes a difference.<br /><br />Apart from that not all dampening timers can be tuned in BGP to as a low level as it is possible for link-state protocols. In theory it could be but there are some race conditions when BGP can miss its triggered compute time and can wait an another 60 seconds. Unless the network is built on BGP IPv4 AFI only and there is no protocol dependencies and a network vendor allows for subsecond tunning. But agree that for large Data Centers the most significant factor is the prefix insertion into FIB. There is no need to fight for every 50 ms.",

      "html": "We use BGP internally on both the Core and Backbone. (We are a moderately large enterprise). The backbone is a simple L3-MPLS-VPN so that we can segregate types of traffic traveling between physical locations without needing to firewall (i.e., Dev, Test, Production, Fin, etc...). BGP also extends to every distribution layer that feeds reachability back to the backbone. There are localized pods of OSPF within certain distribution points but that was due to limited support for BGP by some legacy devices in these environments. Additionally, the default route from our carriers (also BGP peered out at the edge) is extended down into the backbone. There was some concern by operational staff in the beginning, but we strived to keep things very simple, no advanced knob-fiddling. Local-pref for some simple manipulation and it&#39;s been great.<br /><br />In regards to ACI:<br />http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/guide-c07-733236.html#_Toc406851690<br /><br /><br />CWB",
