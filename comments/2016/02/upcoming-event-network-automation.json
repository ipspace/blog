The roadmap is already online http://www.ipspace.net/Roadmap/Network_Automation_webinars but it&#39;s mostly empty at the moment.<br /><br />I&#39;ll probably run another workshop in US sometime in autumn, and it will most likely be a combo of SDN/SDDC/Network Automation materials spread over a week.<br /><br />There might also be an online course covering the same topics. Register into my SDN mailing list and I&#39;ll keep you posted ;)",
