      "html": "I&#39;m not sure nowadays what all the fuss is about Re: TCP overhead.  In the days before TCP offload became common place and checksums were calculated by hand, the overhead *was* material.  Every server I&#39;ve seen recently drives TCP/IP care and feeding directly into silicon.  Combine that with jumbo frames (~4 times the size of a FC frame) and 10 GbE uplinks and I just don&#39;t see that iSCSI&#39;s underlying transport is really an issue anymore.  I can concede that in the high end enterprise spaces I think FC still has the advantage but the SMB people get great performance without the FC investment.  Along these same lines, I also don&#39;t see what all the FCoE fuss is about *except* what it brings to the table re: so-called lossless ethernet.<br /><br />Incidentally, in certain applications (e.g. VMware), NFS over TCP is a requirement so I wouldn&#39;t point to NFS as a connectionless storage protocol.  Perhaps I&#39;m misreading the statement?  Incidentally, there are people in the VMware world that wouldn&#39;t trade their NFS mounts for a FC LUN.<br /><br />At a certain point, and actually it&#39;s quite low, aggregate network (FC included) transport throughput outstrips storage subsystem throughput.  The typical SAN is many-to-one; initiators and targets respectively.  The ultimate measure of storage subsystem performance isn&#39;t throughput in bits/sec at all.  It&#39;s IOPs.  What drives IOPs?  Type, quantity and layout of the spindles, RAID levels and settings appropriate for the application.  Bad storage subsystem design often has more to do with poor &quot;SAN&quot; performance than the networking protocol.<br /><br />I think the FC/iSCSI airgap does have value in a meatspace context.  The storage people have their sandbox and the FC people have theirs.  With iSCSI and FCoE that gap is vacuumed out with the networking people telling the storage people how to do things and vice-versa.<br /><br />Lastly, I&#39;m constantly forwarding posts from this blog to peers.  Great stuff!",
