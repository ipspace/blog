      "html": "You can probably get more throughput on dedicated hardware (like the hugely expensive blades for the 7600 series) or more powerful boxes (ASR comes to mind). I doubt you could squeeze more out of a 7200 with a different IOS release (assuming you want to run HQF). It doesn&#39;t have the latest or the fastest CPU ever invented  8-)",

If it&#39;s not just a cosmetic issue with the drop rate shown on the parent policy than there is another layer of things I&#39;m not understanding. :)",
