The simple fact is that exceedingly technical disciplines such as IT simply don&#39;t appeal as much to women as they do to men. I&#39;m not saying they can&#39;t be good at it, just that it doesn&#39;t interest them, and that&#39;s fine.",

It&#39;s not really a great way to invite women  to participate. <br /><br />I personally have to adopt a very caviler attitude about how I get treated just to do my job. I&#39;m not trying to say that I&#39;m unhappy. Most days the guys respect me and everything is awesome but it can certainly be difficult to feel like you have to prove your worthiness every day above and beyond what the guys around you do. And if you don&#39;t succeed you&#39;re branded some sort of token demographic. It&#39;s engendered in the way that men treat women in the networking fields. Most of the guys I work with are awesome but there is a great deal of pressure to act and behave like one of the boys while at work. I&#39;ve tried being myself and it&#39;s a very lonely world.",

Its true there are not a lot of women in the &quot;down and dirty&quot; mechanic jobs of working with hardware or programming. Its probably a uninteresting to them, since it involves being like a medieval monk working alone and with the equipment.<br /><br />Our management forces (not tyranny) us to take &quot;networking&quot; workshops to learn how to strike up conversations and to expand our social networks. <br /><br />I think as technicians we prefer to deal with logic than with other people, much to our detriment sometimes.
