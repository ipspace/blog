  html: What is the maximum rate at which this can be applied.  On the 7200 I tested
    it maxes out at 100 Mb/s.  Is there another IOS or HW combination that can scale
    higher?

  html: You can probably get more throughput on dedicated hardware (like the hugely
    expensive blades for the 7600 series) or more powerful boxes (ASR comes to mind).
    I doubt you could squeeze more out of a 7200 with a different IOS release (assuming
    you want to run HQF). It doesn&#39;t have the latest or the fastest CPU ever invented  8-)

  html: I noticed that too.  I think it&#39;s cosmetic because if you look farther
    down at the child (Intra) policy, and use the drop rates from both of those the
    math works out as expected.  If it&#39;s not just a cosmetic issue with the drop
    rate shown on the parent policy than there is another layer of things I&#39;m
    not understanding. :)
