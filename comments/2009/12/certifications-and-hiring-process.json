      "html": "Ivan, thanks for sharing your thoughts! Admittedly some of the alternative ideas I suggested were half-baked, as that wasn&#39;t the real focus of the article. I do plan to expand on them in the future though and would appreciate further feedback when I do. I feel like I should expand on a couple points though.<br /><br />My intention in suggesting the review of a candidate&#39;s forum and mailing list participation wasn&#39;t to look for volume but rather quality, even if it&#39;s just a few posts/emails. (For example, has he provided helpful answers to questions posed? Or has he been expressing difficulty with fundamental topics his resume claims he already knows?) Though I agree that an abundance of posts made during work hours is probably a flag to be considered.<br /><br />Certainly most people aren&#39;t going to run their own blogs. However, that doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t publish a quality paper now and then. Guest posts and aggregate blogs like http://www.ccieblog.com/ potentially offer a great platform for such infrequent writing.",

      "html": "Why is that certifications cant be just ONE factor in the hiring process instead having to be THE factor...why is it that its almost implied that certifications are useless and ALL certificate holders are simply brandumpers that really cant do the job or be a good employee.  It needs to be understood that not everyone can simply put their name on an application like Ivan and be hired.  Some people use certifications as ONE way to distinguish themselves among others....lots of people can say they have 10,15 years of experience...  lots of people can say they&#39;ve worked with &quot;xy&quot; technology...does that mean they are proficient at it.....maybe..maybe not....lots of people can say they have worked on a project involving &quot;xy&quot; technology....yea..what capacity?....  Most HR don&#39;t want to read &quot;pages and pages&quot; of experience to determine potential..<br /><br />Not to be vain in anyway as I still learn even the simplest of things everyday...but I feel im more knowledgeable and experienced than others with similar years of experience ...and why....because certifications have pushed me to learn new technologies that I don&#39;t do everyday at my current job...have pushed me to learn the technologies much deeper than I would have simply on the job.  Could I have learned new technologies or learned the technologies deeper without certs...sure...would I have &quot;truly&quot; pushed myself to know the technologies like I do for certs...probably not...why... because I wouldn&#39;t have known better (its sometimes hard to quiz yourself on what you don&#39;t realize you don&#39;t know) without an outsider.  How often do we kid ourselves that we know something when we really don&#39;t.  <br /><br />I have known many people that have said something similar...&quot;I thought I new &quot;xy&quot; technology until I started studying/took the test.  Then I realized I don&#39;t know the half of it&quot;.  I know many people who say they know EIGRP really well because they have entered in &quot;router eigrp 1&quot; &quot;network 10.0.0.0&quot; &quot;no auto-summary&quot;  100s of times...sorry, no.<br /><br />Maybe a cert. could be a sign of other qualities.....maybe a candidate with 10 years of experience and several certs compared to someone with 20 years of experience and no certs shows  signs of &quot;hunger&quot; to still learn...signs to learn new things as they arise as technology as we know it always changes....a lot of people with 20+ years of experience (unlike Ivan) dont still have the passion to learn new things...dig in deeper than is needed for a job..(Ivan is of that less popular breed from what ive seen)  .instead, a lot get &quot;complacent&quot;..do the minimum or pawn it off on the &quot;juniors&quot;...<br /><br />Do Certifications 100% solve these issues...of course not...its all about combinations of things...years of experience, types of experience, types of positions, types of companies, types of certs, levels of certs, how quickly you got your certs..how well do you answer my &quot;experience&quot; questions. (no, Im not going to ask you what the AD is of RIP)..how well do you navigate in the cli, interface, etc in a quick hands-on demonstration..<br /><br />To simply disqualifying certs as meaningless would be just as silly to disqualify people on any other attributes people mentioned..(whose to say that you simply didn&#39;t have a 4.0 GPA because Mommy and Daddy pushed you at the time..also...that maybe was 15,20+ years ago...some people get lazy or have other priorities at they get older...How do I know that your 5 years of AD experience on your resume wasn&#39;t simply you updating users accounts everyday.  There is no 100% way.  ",
