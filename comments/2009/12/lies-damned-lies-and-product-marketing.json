To which they inevitably reply, &quot;no, its a Catalyst xxxx.&quot;  MPLS adds to the confusion, but helps solve some of these problems.  L2 across the WAN?  OK.  Segregated L3 across the WAN?  OK.<br /><br />But anyway, Ivan and all..  Everytime some new technology starts coming down the line, it solves all of our problems.  Remember LANE?  It was going to herald a new era of video and collaboration!  The Catalyst 8540 (The Cougar switch)...  ahh yes... LANE.  I&#39;m so glad that died.<br /><br />Now PBT (or whatever they are calling provider ethernet) is going to save us.  Bandwidth will be ubiquitous and cheap.  We will have video and collaboration.  And they will find a way to twist new meanings into old words as they roll it out with the same recycled marketing literature.<br /><br />Argh!",

Both activities (regardless of their implementation) were called &quot;routing&quot; a decade ago. Not to mention that high-end routers have dedicated routing (aka L3 switching) ASICs and that most switches have to fall back to CPU-based switching once you exceed their hardware resources (or throw too complex packets at them).",
