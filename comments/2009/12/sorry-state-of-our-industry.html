            <div class="comment-content">Personally I&#39;ve been getting more and more irritated every time I hear it suggested that women are somehow being oppressed in IT. The simple fact is that exceedingly technical disciplines such as IT simply don&#39;t appeal as much to women as they do to men. I&#39;m not saying they can&#39;t be good at it, just that it doesn&#39;t interest them, and that&#39;s fine.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I never claimed that women are being oppressed in our industry, but it&#39;s really interesting how they tend to avoid networking. For example, approximately a third of the Computer Science students in Ljubljana are girls, but they tend to focus on other IT areas.<br /><br />As for &quot;that&#39;s fine&quot;, I disagree. Working in a heterogenous environment is always beneficial; you get diverse ideas and perspectives, which can only help you in the long run.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I wouldn&#39;t read too much into the ages represented in those statistics. When you look at the number of people that are active Facebook users *and* have been working in the industry long enough to be interested in professional-level networking topics, I think the graph looks about right. I would guess that there aren&#39;t many 18-24 year olds (Facebook&#39;s main demographic) that are networking professionals, and there probably aren&#39;t many 35+ year old networking professionals that are active Facebook users.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">If you&#39;re actually interested in what is wrong with the demographics, you might review the comments on this post. The third comment says we need more chicks. It&#39;s not really a great way to invite women  to participate. <br /><br />I personally have to adopt a very caviler attitude about how I get treated just to do my job. I&#39;m not trying to say that I&#39;m unhappy. Most days the guys respect me and everything is awesome but it can certainly be difficult to feel like you have to prove your worthiness every day above and beyond what the guys around you do. And if you don&#39;t succeed you&#39;re branded some sort of token demographic. It&#39;s engendered in the way that men treat women in the networking fields. Most of the guys I work with are awesome but there is a great deal of pressure to act and behave like one of the boys while at work. I&#39;ve tried being myself and it&#39;s a very lonely world.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Thanks for the comment. Unfortunately every environment has its own share of &quot;socially challenged&quot; individuals.<br /><br />I have a pretty good idea how you feel. For a (relatively) small Slovenian company (typical question: where&#39;s that? Are you part of Soviet Union?) operating worldwide, every project is an uphill struggle where you have to prove you&#39;re better than any alternative (otherwise the customer thinks there&#39;s no reason to work with you). I&#39;ve been working in this environment for over 15 years. It&#39;s challenging, but it also keeps you alert ;)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I work for a large Canadian telco in their engineering/networking/service development/CTO group. From my experience, women a well represented in the roles that deal with human to human interaction, so there are an even number of women as men in the project management field. Its true there are not a lot of women in the &quot;down and dirty&quot; mechanic jobs of working with hardware or programming. Its probably a uninteresting to them, since it involves being like a medieval monk working alone and with the equipment.<br /><br />Our management forces (not tyranny) us to take &quot;networking&quot; workshops to learn how to strike up conversations and to expand our social networks. <br /><br />I think as technicians we prefer to deal with logic than with other people, much to our detriment sometimes. So I think women don&#39;t want to end up like us.<br /><br />I think the women make a rational choice, they don&#39;t find the work interesting or beneficial so they look else where.</div>
