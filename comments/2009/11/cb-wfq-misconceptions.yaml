  html: I think that the conclusion here is that the &quot;bandwidth percent&quot;
    statement doesn&#39;t limit the amount of bandwidth available for that class,
    it simply guarantees that the class will receive 50% during times of congestion.
    During normal operation it is highly possible that the class will receive more
    than 50% of the available bandwidth. Certainly that behavior is backed up by experience.
    If you want to limit the class to 50%, then policing or shaping is the way to
    go.

    simply does not work at the moment. Queue is empty. Line can send traffic at offered
    rate.

  html: The main problem with CBWFQ was that you couldn&#39;t have fair-queue inside
    a class with bandwidth statement and you couldn&#39;t have bandwidth in class-default.
    I think these are resolved somewhere in 12.4(20)T with HQF but I haven&#39;t tested
    it.<br /><br />I think that you can do the following now:<br />policy mypolicy<br
    /> class Aclass<br />   bandwidth percent 50<br />   fair-queue<br /> class class-default<br
    />  bandwidth percent 50<br />  fair-queue

    action can get WAY MORE than you&#39;d expect UNDER CONGESTION and starve the
    default class.

  html: this restriction of unequal distribution for &quot;classes without bandwidth
    keyword&quot; has been fixed in IOS 12.4(22)T onwards which support HQF..on those
    IOS, regardless of configuration, class class-default in HQF images will always
    have an implicit bandwidth reservation equal to the unused interface bandwidth
    not consumed by user-defined classes.  <br /> <br />So on 12.4(22)T onwards, CBWFQ
    has kind of inbuilt policer (somewhat like LLQ)  <br /> <br />12.4(22)T onwards
    support Hierarchical Queueing Framework (HQF) feature.. In HQF images, flow-based
    fair-queues, configurable in both user-defined classes and class default with
    fair-queue, are scheduled equally (instead of by Weight). By default, the class-default
    class receives a minimum of 1% of the interface or parent shape bandwidth. It
    is also possible to explicitly configure the bandwidth CLI in class default.  <br

  html: The demonstrated result is the correct behaviour. The &quot;bandwidth&quot;
    or &quot;bandwidth percent&quot; commands allocates the configured bandwidth for
    a class/queue. In case of more traffic or congestion, these classes will starve
    the class-default class, essentially making it a &quot;sacrificial goat&quot;.
    This is CB-WFQ.<br /><br />On the other hand, &quot;priority&quot; command will
    absolutely cut-off at the configured bandwidth but that makes it LLQ. 8-)

  html: Yah. I dealt with that at one site by using a &quot;police cir percent &lt;bw&gt;
    pir percent &lt;bw&gt;&quot; style policy over several classes. That way, classes
    can exceed their minimum guaranteed bandwidth but can&#39;t consume the entire
    link.

  html: I agree with you that class High can theoritically starve the default class...<br
    /><br />...However if you ran 2 simultaneous TCP sessions during your test, after
    a few &quot;moments&quot;, shouldn&#39;t the behavior of TCP (slow start, round
    trip time measurement, congestion window, and all the stuff like that... I&#39;m
    not an TCP expert ;) ) equal balance the throughput of both TCP sessions?

  html: My understanding is that under congestion any remaining bandwidth after queuing
    allocations gets assigned proportionately.  So of the remaining 128K, High would
    get 50%, and class-default would get an implied 50%.  You can influence this with
    the command bandwidth remaining.

  html: Ivan,<br /><br />Can&#39;t go past any QoS discussion :) Here is the summary
    of the &quot;research&quot; i did back in days on CBWFQ (classic)<br /><br />http://blog.internetworkexpert.com/2008/08/17/insights-on-cbwfq/<br
    /><br />Back then i tried to do some &quot;reverse engineering&quot; on CBWFQ,
    to show how exactly it adapts the classif WFQ weighting formula. Right now i&#39;m
    trying to come with a similar writeup on HQF, though it significantly tougher
    - they hide all &quot;implementation-dependent&quot; details now.<br /><br />As
    it can be seen, CBWFQ really treats class-default &quot;poorly&quot;, even with
    fair-queue enabled. Cisco never clarified that misconcept, and I personally had
    some real-life issues with it :)

  html: Your original tested yielded exactly the results one might expect on a ISR
    or 7200 running code prior to 12.4.20T.     The bottom line is that a class based
    queue in not guaranteed any significant bandwidth unless there is a bandwidth
    statement applied.  You chose to forgo the minimum bandwidth guarantee to do WFQ
    in the default class, thus the default class was essentially serviced in a best
    effort manor, and the 10.0.3.2 flow received less bandwidth.  Lesson learned hear
    is to be explicit in your configurations and don&#39;t always rely on defaults
    if you don&#39;t know the default behavior for a particular device.  <br /><br
    />Now as mentioned earlier, Cisco made a code change to the ISR/7200 QoS code
    starting in 12.4.20T finishing in 12.4.22T.  This code change eliminated the WFQ
    option in the class-default and now allows for FQ to be enable in any non-priority
    class in conjunction with the bandwidth command.  This change makes the queuing
    behavior more like the 7500, flexwan and SIP200.   :-D
