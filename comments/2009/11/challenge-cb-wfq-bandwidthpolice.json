To be clear:<br />class P5001<br />  bandwidth percent 50<br />Guarantees 50 percent of the band width but does not restrict it to only 50 percent.<br /><br /> class P5002<br />   police rate percent 50<br />     violate-action drop<br />Restricts to no more than 50 percent of the bandwidth but does not guarantee any.<br /><br />So, basically, CB-WFQ does exactly what it is supposed to do with the configurations you&#39;ve posted.",

What I learned from that day is that you should always assign some bandwidth value in case if you want any  guarantees - fair queue command in class-default makes sense only when used standalone.<br /><br />The link i provided in my previous post demostrates how that stuff works in pre-HQF implementations.<br /><br />Petr",
