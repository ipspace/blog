  html: rtsp://qtstreamer.ripe.net/RIPE59/coopwg.mov <br /><br />Here is the video
    recording of Thorne&#39;s speech at Cooperation WG on RIPE. Just skip to 42:15<br

  html: Forgot to add my .2 cents worth, I&#39;m not by default against the idea of
    &quot;national authority&quot; in means of IP distribution, this mess should be
    sorted out one way or another, we don&#39;t need 76 LIRs in Slovenia... <br /><br
    />http://aquila-www.ripe.net/membership/indices/SI.html<br /><br />But that issue
    should be solved by RIR, not ITU. People get old, retire and die, ITU got old
    and useless.<br /><br />Jan

  html: Superficially this looks like a play by the Chinese Government to take control
    for IPv6 addressing and control it for themselves. The author is clearly Chinese
    and appear to be operating along party political lines. Which is consistent with
    the way that the Chinese Government has acted elsewhere and thus makes the conclusion
    logical. <br /><br />That said, the current process  is working, is independent
    and has global acceptance. The question of how much longer the entire world will
    allow the US governement (light touch be damned) to run the Internet seems to
    be a major issue. If the Islamic and Asian sub-continents join together then change
    is likely to be coming. And, equally, the Americans are going to whinge and whine
    all the way. <br /><br />It&#39;s gonna be fun. <br /><br />The ITU is unworkable
    however because it is easily manipulated by political issues. I don&#39;t want
    to see a return of the old telecommunications standards because some government
    wants to encourage a locally developed technology.

  html: 'The story is not over yet, after IGF in Egypt ITU still insist on having
    their v6 piece of pie. Now they presented their visions in slightly different
    format, but under cover everything is still just obvious crap. As would my friend
    Randy say: &quot;this stuff is hard enough without bullshit&quot; :)<br /><br
