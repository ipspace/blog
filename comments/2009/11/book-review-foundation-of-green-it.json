      "html": "The book is okay but there are some glaring &#39;omissions&#39; one example is the around the benefits of desktop virtualisation and how they even support offline working - both VMware and Citrix offline desktop implementations are experimental and there is no official support. The book also fails to mention the potential problems with respect to storage requirements even with the use of linked clones the storage requirements can be quite substantial. Don&#39;t get me wrong the book is good but it seems to omit some challenges/pitfalls and &#39;hidden costs&#39;.",
