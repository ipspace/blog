            <div class="comment-content">Why? Because a carpenter is less likely to have played with roofing, electrical work and plumbing before deciding to focus on carpentry.<br />Where-as some of us have played with programming (assembler, basic, C), web design, Windows OS administration, Linux administration, Oracle etc. before deciding to specialise in communications. It&#39;s not such a stretch at all.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Greg is right about the reason, but it should be avoided. The worst mistake I observe in my job is web programmers forced to be sysadmins of web servers. This is nearly always a bad idea, because there are no checks and balances, the coders can do whatever they want to mess up production servers ;-)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">One reason I see come up quite often is the manager of the &quot;IT Admin&quot; expects the person who fills this role to know all about IT. You usually see this in small to medium size businesses were a single IT person is all that is needed full time and usually reports to someone within the company that knows nothing about IT. <br /><br />I have also seen these managers get upset when confronted with the notion that the IT admin does not know all and consultants should be brought in for specialty project out of the IT admins scope.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Because  <br /> <br />1) there are not enough IT people around to do everything that needs to be done. The world is still transitioning from a Jock-based culture to a Geek-based culture, and those people who are bright enough to learn something new are not all that common.  <br /> <br />2) IT people are often bright, flexible, artistic and creative. If you consider artists as an analogy, many are equally able to paint, scuplt, write, draw and act but choose one aspect as their primary focus, and use other aspects of art to keep their creativity going. IT people will work outside their chosen field as creative exercise. That doesn&#39;t make it right, but that&#39;s why we do it.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Well, no one would really ask a plumber to do the electric work in a company, but surely enough the IT guy would always be asked to switch from being a Systems Engineer to a Network Engineer, and who knows at times, you may even be expected to be a DBA expert.<br /><br />As Greg, most of us are in the field because this is what we enjoy doing. It is a passion... new technologies are like hot breads from the oven. You want to get your hands on it and learn more of it.<br /><br />The problem is that, some of us, after plugging their first switch and connecting the console cable have already &quot;Network Expert&quot; labelled on their resume... I have met many supposedly &quot;Senior Unix Expert&quot;, who barely understood the basic subroutines of the kernel... and many &quot;Network Expert&quot; who never knew what &quot;TCP Congestion Control&quot; is all about...<br /><br />That is to say, management might be the root of the cause of this problem in most company, but we surely started it with our legendary ego :-)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">It&#39;s a question of scale and cost. In small/medium businesses, where IT is not key to the business running, a single jack-of-all-trades admin is simply a more cost effective proposition than having several specialists, either full time or on an as-needed consultancy basis.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">If we stick with your woodworker analogy, I would say that I know a ton of people that work with their hands and have a specific job they normally do, but they would be up to tackling any project around the house. They will fix a toilet, remodel the kitchen or roof the house. You meet IT people like that too. <br /><br />I would even say that in order to work for a small Cisco reseller as an engineer you need a diverse skill set. You might do a wireless install one day, a firewall the next, voice, call center with database integration and web page integration, unity with exchange,Tcl scripting, Perl scripting....the list goes on. <br /><br />On the other hand I have met double CCIE&#39;s working for a large reseller that wouldn&#39;t touch anything VoIP related to save his life, but he knew firewalls &amp; routers to an amazing depth. And that was fine, because there was a need for his super router skills.<br /><br />I guess my point is that there are positions for &#39;jack of all trade&#39; people and there are positions for specialists.</div>

I have had 10 years doing PC support, 7 years doing System administration (Windows, Solaris, Linux), 8 years doing Cisco and Nortel networking and the last 5 years in InfoSec. I keep up with many of these area in the interest of flexibility and job security.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Forget the analogies for a minute and think practically.  First, if you want your data communications to fail, then let anyone configure your routers and switches - programmer, system administrator, excel jockey, etc.  You&#39;ll learn the hard way that someone proficient in the job is the best choice if you want it to work well.  <br /><br />Secondly, certainly people are right when they observe that there are not enough people in many, if not most, IT departments to address all the IT needs.  That, however, is a not a good reason to turn the local MSoffice expert loose on the router you depend upon to connect your websites to the Internet.  If you can&#39;t afford a full time data communications person and your needs in that department are not pressing enough, then hire a consultant who knows what to do.  Don&#39;t turn your HTML/Excel/etc programmer (sorry, I couldn&#39;t leave that one alone :-) loose on your cisco gear just because you don&#39;t like consultants.  Unless, that is, you&#39;re okay with failure.<br /><br />All professional fields have within them mutually exclusive fields of expertise.  To switch back to less-than-fitting analogies for a diverting second, nobody wants an eye surgeon doing brain surgery or vice versa.  So data comm people should be turning up T1&#39;s and windows system admins should be running active directory domains.  If someone running an IT department doesn&#39;t see it that way, keep your resume up to date.  That individual will be looking for someone to blame for some kind of disaster in the near future.</div>

The majority of IT folks I have ran across over the years are very cocky. They think they can do everything.

            <div class="comment-content">Some parallels can be drawn between IT and the medical field I believe. While all doctors share some fundamental level of common knowledge and can most likely handle common basic diagnoses and treatment, there is the necessity for specialization. This is good to keep in mind when troubleshooting perhaps or assisting others in troubleshooting because as the human body has functionality that is common to all medical understanding the systems that we work on in some way share a common technological component. Our troubleshooting should lead us into areas of specialization in which we would accel at what we know within the confines of our skills or we would find that it is time to bring in the proper specialist to address the issue.</div>

They always seem to be true believers in &quot;get it connected&quot; and not worry about anything else. As to the parallels with art - art doesn&#39;t just come from the traditional forms of artistic expression (painting, sculpture, music, etc.) - art can also be found in the communications field.
