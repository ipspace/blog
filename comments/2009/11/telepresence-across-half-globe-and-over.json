When the average goes over 10 % for an interval of 12 x 10 sec, we get disconnected.<br />Some details:<br /><br /> -- Video --<br /><br />Latency     Avg : 0                        Period : 0                       Currently Active : No                      Statistics                                Center                             Aux<br />Tx Media Type                              H.264                           H.264<br />Tx Bytes                               227658700                               0<br />Tx Packets                                235591                               0<br />Rx Media Type                              H.264                           H.264<br />Rx Bytes                               217749019                         1500294<br />Rx Packets                                209640                            1423<br />Rx Packets Lost                             8650                             111 <br />  Pkts % Call                              3.9626                          7.2360 <br />  Pkts % Period                           11.2478                          9.3220<br />Rx Pkts OOO                                    0                               0<br />Rx Pkts Dup&#39;d                                  0                               0<br />Rx Pkts Late                                   7                               0<br />Rx Pkts AuthFail                               0                               0<br />Rx Jitter/Call                               120                              81<br />Rx Jitter/Period                             164                              65",
