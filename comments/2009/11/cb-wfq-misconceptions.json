During normal operation it is highly possible that the class will receive more than 50% of the available bandwidth. Certainly that behavior is backed up by experience. If you want to limit the class to 50%, then policing or shaping is the way to go.",

The bottom line is that a class based queue in not guaranteed any significant bandwidth unless there is a bandwidth statement applied.  You chose to forgo the minimum bandwidth guarantee to do WFQ in the default class, thus the default class was essentially serviced in a best effort manor, and the 10.0.3.2 flow received less bandwidth.  Lesson learned hear is to be explicit in your configurations and don&#39;t always rely on defaults if you don&#39;t know the default behavior for a particular device.  <br /><br />Now as mentioned earlier, Cisco made a code change to the ISR/7200 QoS code starting in 12.4.20T finishing in 12.4.22T.  This code change eliminated the WFQ option in the class-default and now allows for FQ to be enable in any non-priority class in conjunction with the bandwidth command.  This change makes the queuing behavior more like the 7500, flexwan and SIP200.   :-D",
