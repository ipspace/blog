            <div class="comment-content">Forgot to add my .2 cents worth, I&#39;m not by default against the idea of &quot;national authority&quot; in means of IP distribution, this mess should be sorted out one way or another, we don&#39;t need 76 LIRs in Slovenia... <br /><br />http://aquila-www.ripe.net/membership/indices/SI.html<br /><br />But that issue should be solved by RIR, not ITU. People get old, retire and die, ITU got old and useless.<br /><br />Jan</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Superficially this looks like a play by the Chinese Government to take control for IPv6 addressing and control it for themselves. The author is clearly Chinese and appear to be operating along party political lines. Which is consistent with the way that the Chinese Government has acted elsewhere and thus makes the conclusion logical. <br /><br />That said, the current process  is working, is independent and has global acceptance. The question of how much longer the entire world will allow the US governement (light touch be damned) to run the Internet seems to be a major issue. If the Islamic and Asian sub-continents join together then change is likely to be coming. And, equally, the Americans are going to whinge and whine all the way. <br /><br />It&#39;s gonna be fun. <br /><br />The ITU is unworkable however because it is easily manipulated by political issues. I don&#39;t want to see a return of the old telecommunications standards because some government wants to encourage a locally developed technology.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The story is not over yet, after IGF in Egypt ITU still insist on having their v6 piece of pie. Now they presented their visions in slightly different format, but under cover everything is still just obvious crap. As would my friend Randy say: &quot;this stuff is hard enough without bullshit&quot; :)<br /><br />Jan</div>
