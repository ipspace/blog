  html: The book is okay but there are some glaring &#39;omissions&#39; one example
    is the around the benefits of desktop virtualisation and how they even support
    offline working - both VMware and Citrix offline desktop implementations are experimental
    and there is no official support. The book also fails to mention the potential
    problems with respect to storage requirements even with the use of linked clones
    the storage requirements can be quite substantial. Don&#39;t get me wrong the
    book is good but it seems to omit some challenges/pitfalls and &#39;hidden costs&#39;.
