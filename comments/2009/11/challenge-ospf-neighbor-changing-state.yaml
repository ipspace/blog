  html: 'There is hidden &quot;ignore&quot; timer. If neighbor do something wrong
    its ignored for period of that timer.<br />How too reproduce this: on one of two
    routers connected by Ethernet interfaces filter unicast (but not multicast) packets
    of ospf protocol  in both directions - routers will periodically establish two-way
    adjacency, but they can&#39;t exchange their databases...'

  html: I get the same message even though the MTUs on both sides are the same. What

  html: you are using multicast, and multiaccesss environment, one of the routers
    keep sending prune message, which effect the ospf relation.
