  html: Can this technique be adapted/extended to detect and alert on drops on a per-QoS
    class basis? I&#39;m investigating ways to generate a trap when drops within specific
    traffic classes reach specified thresholds.

  html: In principle it can, with two significant drawbacks:<br /><br />* You have
    to monitor an SNMP OID which is hard to construct (the MQC MIB is complex)<br
    />* The MIB variables are updated only once every 10 seconds.<br /><br />See also:<br
