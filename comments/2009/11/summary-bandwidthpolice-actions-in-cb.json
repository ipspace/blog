As some &quot;extra&quot; reading I may refer folks to the following document:<br /><br />http://www.internetworkexpert.com/downloads/IEWB-RS-VOL-I-V5.Section.10.QoS.teaser.pdf<br /><br />It breaks down a few QoS topics in &quot;scenario/solution&quot; manner and covers Hold-Queue, WFQ and IP RTP Reserve features (I spent a lot of time on simulations for those). I found that many people have poor understanding of WFQ and knowing this technology is essential to understanding CBWFQ.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Petr",

My question is since I guarranted 5mb/s bandwidth for Ciritical application in HO during congestion, how would I control that HO would not transfer morethan 1mb/s (critical application) to Branches during network congestion. I&#39;m worried since 5mb/s is guarranted for critical application in HO, it might transfer that size to branches which for sure could cause huge inbound traffic to remote offices.  <br /> <br />Hope you can give me some suggestion how to address this kind of setup.  <br /> <br />Regards,  <br /> <br />Arnold<br /><br />Read more: http://blog.ioshints.info/2010/01/update-workaround-for-sluggish-cb-qos.html#ixzz0xMREm4XR",
