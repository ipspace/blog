            <p class="comment-content">I&#39;ve got router in turkey with a GRE tunnel to Belford and Florance. The ISP has made a change to their service and since that time the EIGRP relationship has been loosing the neighbors every 15 minutes on the money. Both neighbors are flapping at the same time!!!! We cannot find any evidence of a circuit issue. Until the root problem is resolved, is there a way to keep the flapping down? I&#39;ve already increased the hold timers to three minutes.</p>

            <p class="comment-content">It also depends on the kind of traffic u pass through between the tunnels.  Make sure ur network is not congested and all ur QoS settings are properly tuned.</p>
