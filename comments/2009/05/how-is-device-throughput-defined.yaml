  html: Sorry - 'optimal' packet sizes for use in marketing materials are large packets,
    around 1500 bytes or thereabouts.<br /><br />Cisco and other vendors still make
    use of 'iMix', even though it's both old and has never borne any relevance whatsoever
    to traffic profiles on any real network anywhere, at any time.<br /><br />As you
    indicate, what's really needed is to develop a performance envelope for a given
    device/interface with packet sizes/frame rates from the applicable minimum to
    the applicable maximum, a la RFC2544, as well as with various features enabled/disabled.

  html: For testing throughput in pps, optimal should be "as small as possible", but
    for testing throughput in bps, optimal should be "as large as possible not fragmented"
    - am I right?

  html: All three of us are basically in agreement. If you're measuring throughput
    in bps, it's ideal to use large packets (increasing bps @ constant pps). <br /><br
    />If you're measuring throughput in pps, packet sizes usually don't matter much
    as long as you can generate enough packets based on your bps throughput and port
    density. Most of the receive/send processing (which is packet-size-dependent)
    is done in hardware and the CPU (or ASICs) just swaps pointers to packet headers.<br
    /><br />For IPSec performance in pps, it's probably ideal to have small packets
    ... I'm assuming that the packet size affects the encryption/decryption time,
    which should be the major part of the per-packet processing time.

  html: Ivan, thanks for linking to the IMIX post we put up, you might also find the
    <A HREF="http://www.breakingpointsystems.com/community/blog/tags/truth%20in%20testing"
    REL="nofollow">truth in testing</A> series of running posts we have helpful, we
    try and hit on this topic a lot about what realistic testing actually means and
    how to question data sheets in that light.<br /><br />Kyle

  html: There is also the flip-side to this... whenever a vendor talks to you about
    replacing your existing products, they tend to put the most broken mirror they
    can find in front of what you have and claim the existing product is inadequate.
    We recently experienced this from our cisco account team... they threw up 64-byte
    ethernet throughput numbers for one of our devices and claimed that it didn&#39;t
    offer as much &#39;throughput&#39; as the cisco product.<br /><br />However, using
    64-byte ethernet frames is hardly a good indication of throughput. It is a good
    way to test packet-per-second rates, but throughput is best tested with 1500 byte
    frames as Roland mentioned above.

  html: 'Well, none of the values  &quot;pps&quot; and &quot;bps&quot; describing
    the throughput of IPsec is constant when changing the packet size. It is caused
    by sub-processes in the whole IPsec process: e.g. encryption could be expressed
    in constant value of &quot;bps&quot; and database  lookups (SPD, SAD) in constant
    value of &quot;pps&quot;. But since these sub-processes are consecutive and held
    by the same processor, they all &quot;shape&quot; the final throughput. <br /><br
    />Of course, it is true that the highest throughput value in &quot;bps&quot; is
    for the largest packet (~1500 B) and the highest throughput value in &quot;pps&quot;
    is for the smallest packet.  And it is also true that most vendors publish the
    performacne of their devices in &quot;bps&quot; for the largest packet and less
    of them for iMix traffic (understandable, as the value for iMix is lower).'

  html: For example, I measured on Cisco 1841 for ESP-aes with crypto-accelerator
    enabled:<br />0.823 Mbps for 20 B payload packet<br />42.61 Mbps for 1390 B payload
    packet<br />and some 30 Mbps for iMix traffic.
