      "html": "Just in addition<br /><br />In Juniper these packets are called \"exception\" packets. The exception packet is every packet which should be processed by the Routing Engine (RE) (which analogy in Cisco I believe is the MSFC (the route processor))instead of being switched. So, the exception packets are handled with a low priority. It depends on how much is the CPU loaded in the time when the packet is received. If the routing engine / msfc is currently busy with more important task (let's say for example there are two or three BGP neighbors which routing information should be converged) the CPU (RE/MSFC) can just ignore those low-priority packets which may result as * * * in some traceroute outputs, because it's quite important job to build the routing table than to answer some silly questions (ICMP TTL expired in transit). <br /><br />Hope that helps!",
