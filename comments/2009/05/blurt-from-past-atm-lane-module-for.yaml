  html: I first got into networking around 1999, the LAN I was working on at the time
    was built around LANE and 3COM CoreBuilders. It sure colours your understanding
    of how a LAN really works ;)<br /><br />Sean

  html: I think it was Kalapana, they we some kind of pioneers in the switching area
    if I recall well. The 3000 and LANE was not so bad, it was expensive though and
    LANE was difficult to configure.

  html: It was ok as long as you don't stack the Catalyst 3000s using the special
    cables :-) It was not an IOS CLI switch by the way; it was menu-driven like 3COM.

  html: I worked for Madge in the nineties - the pay off line was "Switching to ATM"<br
    />This strategy largely led to Madge's downfall which was at that stage the fifth
    largest network company in the world.<br />I do think that some of the service
    assurance features available in ATM have not yet been implemented to this day
    in the alternative technologies.
