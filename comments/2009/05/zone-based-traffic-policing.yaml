  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Is there a way to setup IOS Zone base firewall same as
    Active/Active? I got a site with two wan router, each has separate MPLS Provider
    and its load balance. I have configurare the ZBF on the two router, but I encounter
    erratic issue, I know ZBF is causing this because when I remove the ZBF from the
    interface, issues is gone.<br /><br />Any tip how to best setup ZBF on site that
    has two active WAN router.<br /><br />Your help is greatly appreciated.<br /><br
    />Regards,<br /><br />Arnold
