  html: Just in addition<br /><br />In Juniper these packets are called "exception"
    packets. The exception packet is every packet which should be processed by the
    Routing Engine (RE) (which analogy in Cisco I believe is the MSFC (the route processor))instead
    of being switched. So, the exception packets are handled with a low priority.
    It depends on how much is the CPU loaded in the time when the packet is received.
    If the routing engine / msfc is currently busy with more important task (let's
    say for example there are two or three BGP neighbors which routing information
    should be converged) the CPU (RE/MSFC) can just ignore those low-priority packets
    which may result as * * * in some traceroute outputs, because it's quite important
    job to build the routing table than to answer some silly questions (ICMP TTL expired
    in transit). <br /><br />Hope that helps!

  html: In Juniper reply to ordinary pings generated by special processor on PFE,
    not on RE. But if, for example, you request to record route - only then reply
    generated by RE and not by PFE.

  html: 'exception in IOS-XE : the ESP in the ASR answers icmp echo requests. they''re
    not punted to the RP.<br /><br />basically, if you can see them with "debug ip
    icmp", it means they''re process-switched.<br /><br />and fast-switching is dead.'

  html: and PXF platforms (7300-nse-100,10000) generate the echo reply in PXF, they
    don't punt to the RP.

  html: The question as stated here doesn't specify that it's talking about ICMP packets
    *sent*to*the*router*.<br /><br />That's a pretty important distinction, and one
    that often trips people up.<br /><br />Sure, responding to an echo request is
    low priority, but *forwarding* an echo request is not.
