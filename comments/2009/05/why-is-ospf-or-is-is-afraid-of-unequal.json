      "html": "In my opinion - <br /><br />I believe UCLB is possible, but it will require  major changes to the SPF algorithm, mainly becuase SPF doesn't know what lies ahead - it grows from the the root to the leaves. so calculating an alternative path, for EVERY node and checking the FC for it (the implication would be not to remove the root neighbor node's triplet from the TENT list until it is checked agianst every node that enters the PATH list, for the FC), when just in the building process seems quite intense.<br /><br />Link state protocols get raw data and calculate the SPF tree. Distance vector protocols get processed data - they don't have to run any calculations, just pick the lowest.<br /><br />So i am guessing implementing UCLB in distance vector protocols (or OSPF inter-area), by adding communication of advertised distances between neighbors, will be less difficult to implement than in OSPF/IS-IS intra-area.",

      "html": "Actually, the UCLB question could be answered in terms of histroy and features. The designers of OSPF and IS-IS at their time of origination never envisioned the type of networks we would have today and even during their protocol evolution over time to factor that &quot;feature&quot; in. The other consideration is that the mold was made for these protocols and integration of UCLB would be too difficult and costly for the many distros of the protocols. <br />Now UCLB can be &quot;added&quot; on top of the routing protocol just like another policy routing type feature or feature in general. Look at BFD and Ethernet CFM that could have been designed in the beginning but it was not and thus now it is available as an option to enhance the underlying protocols operation.<br /><br />So, maybe in IOS 16 we will get a UCLB knob for OSPF and IS-IS.",
