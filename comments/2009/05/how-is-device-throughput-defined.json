      "html": "All three of us are basically in agreement. If you're measuring throughput in bps, it's ideal to use large packets (increasing bps @ constant pps). <br /><br />If you're measuring throughput in pps, packet sizes usually don't matter much as long as you can generate enough packets based on your bps throughput and port density. Most of the receive/send processing (which is packet-size-dependent) is done in hardware and the CPU (or ASICs) just swaps pointers to packet headers.<br /><br />For IPSec performance in pps, it's probably ideal to have small packets ... I'm assuming that the packet size affects the encryption/decryption time, which should be the major part of the per-packet processing time.",

      "html": "There is also the flip-side to this... whenever a vendor talks to you about replacing your existing products, they tend to put the most broken mirror they can find in front of what you have and claim the existing product is inadequate. We recently experienced this from our cisco account team... they threw up 64-byte ethernet throughput numbers for one of our devices and claimed that it didn&#39;t offer as much &#39;throughput&#39; as the cisco product.<br /><br />However, using 64-byte ethernet frames is hardly a good indication of throughput. It is a good way to test packet-per-second rates, but throughput is best tested with 1500 byte frames as Roland mentioned above.",

      "html": "Well, none of the values  &quot;pps&quot; and &quot;bps&quot; describing the throughput of IPsec is constant when changing the packet size. It is caused by sub-processes in the whole IPsec process: e.g. encryption could be expressed in constant value of &quot;bps&quot; and database  lookups (SPD, SAD) in constant value of &quot;pps&quot;. But since these sub-processes are consecutive and held by the same processor, they all &quot;shape&quot; the final throughput. <br /><br />Of course, it is true that the highest throughput value in &quot;bps&quot; is for the largest packet (~1500 B) and the highest throughput value in &quot;pps&quot; is for the smallest packet.  And it is also true that most vendors publish the performacne of their devices in &quot;bps&quot; for the largest packet and less of them for iMix traffic (understandable, as the value for iMix is lower).",
