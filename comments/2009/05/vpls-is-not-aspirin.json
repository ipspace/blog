      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Your expressed views appear a bit single-sided. Carrier Ethernet (including VPLS) is very often sold as a backbone carriage solution for customers to run their L3 on top. The case of people \"just plugging their LAN switches into it\" is pretty rare, as Carrier Ethernet typically steals market share from other technologies (P2P links and IP VPNs), and people usually already have routers in place.<br /><br />The security issues you pointed out for VPLS are more of  a corner case then something really prominent, too.",

      "html": "Hi cdplayer!<br /><br />If we could ensure that everyone connected to a VPLS service will deploy CE routers, I'd be extremely happy. Unfortunately, the reality (particularly with mid-sized SPs and SMB customers) tends to go the other way, more so as people are trying to cut costs.<br /><br />Assuming the customer has deployed CE routers, we're facing a scalability issue as all of them are connected to the same virtual LAN segment, which is not a good idea if you're talking about hundreds of sites.",

      "html": "From my service provider experience where we run VPLS, its a great step in carrier ethernet. Multipoint feature does the job very well. Customers in most cases have Routers sitting as CE and simply giving ethernet frames to SP. If they have too many sites, they carefully plan the traffic pattern and sites are isolated if required on a separate L2 broadcast domain. I believe your CE equipment in head office seeing the next hop as CE in branch more comfortable than seeing PE as next hop. Moreover, there is no possibility of SP getting hit by loops as CP seperated from DP.",

      "html": "Hi Ivan, from your perspective, CPE routers are necessary in order for VPLS to work properly, but in my mind that negates the &quot;sexy&quot; sticker that analysts have slapped on the service. I thought the whole idea gaining plug and play benefits of a native LAN. <br /><br />Here&#39;s Heavy Reading&#39;s take in 2007 on Verizon&#39;s flavor - <br /><br />Stan Hubbard, Lead Analyst \u2013 Heavy Reading<br />&quot;Verizon Business delivered the goods again in 2007 by demonstrating a strategic commitment to transform the data connectivity services landscape through Ethernet portfolio innovations that address on-demand enterprise needs. Light Reading and Heavy Reading have been particularly impressed by its national VPLS rollout, international expansion activities and plans, and widespread deployment of Ethernet access platforms that extend the benefits of high-performance Ethernet to more customer locations.&quot; <br /><br />Is this just fluff???",

      "html": "As a service provider we do a lot of VPLS networks for small to mid-size businesses (5-40 sites) and we really don&#39;t run into customers looking to connect a switch directly to the network. Customers invariably are coming from another technology (IP VPNs, IPSEC over DIA etc) that provides them with an existing router they simply re-use. <br /><br />Code-E: the real benefit of VPLS isn&#39;t that it doesn&#39;t require a router it is that it provides the benefits of IP VPN while giving the customer full control over layer 3. For us that means no more issues interacting with customer routing protocols (eg EIGRP in particular), no more modifying static routes and adding new subnets manually for static routed customers and much simpler troubleshooting when something breaks. For the customer it means the ability to run any routing protocol they like, better convergence times than IP VPNs and the ability to segment their network using VLANs over the WAN for different departments or divisions. <br /><br />As you start to exceed around 100 sites you start to have to think about scalability more as Sundar mentioned but below that level it is just a no-brainer if you need a private network and you can find a service provider that can deliver VPLS to all of your locations. <br /><br />I know there isn&#39;t a ton of blog coverage on service-provider delivered VPLS networks so I thought some of you might enjoy our blog which has a number of posts on VPLS http://www.cavtel.com/business/blog/",
