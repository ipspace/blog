            <div class="comment-content">Just in addition<br /><br />In Juniper these packets are called "exception" packets. The exception packet is every packet which should be processed by the Routing Engine (RE) (which analogy in Cisco I believe is the MSFC (the route processor))instead of being switched. So, the exception packets are handled with a low priority. It depends on how much is the CPU loaded in the time when the packet is received. If the routing engine / msfc is currently busy with more important task (let's say for example there are two or three BGP neighbors which routing information should be converged) the CPU (RE/MSFC) can just ignore those low-priority packets which may result as * * * in some traceroute outputs, because it's quite important job to build the routing table than to answer some silly questions (ICMP TTL expired in transit). <br /><br />Hope that helps!</div>

            <div class="comment-content">In Juniper reply to ordinary pings generated by special processor on PFE, not on RE. But if, for example, you request to record route - only then reply generated by RE and not by PFE.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">exception in IOS-XE : the ESP in the ASR answers icmp echo requests. they're not punted to the RP.<br /><br />basically, if you can see them with "debug ip icmp", it means they're process-switched.<br /><br />and fast-switching is dead.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The question as stated here doesn't specify that it's talking about ICMP packets *sent*to*the*router*.<br /><br />That's a pretty important distinction, and one that often trips people up.<br /><br />Sure, responding to an echo request is low priority, but *forwarding* an echo request is not.</div>
