I tried to find more information about that but unfortunately unsuccessful. <br /><br />I've noticed that some OSPF LSAs have \"routing bit\" set on. I checked and realized that there is no such thing in OSPFs RFC. I can't understand what is it's purpose? <br /><br />Thanks in advance!",

So when you see &quot;Routing Bit Set on this LSA,&quot; it means that the route to this destination is in the routing table.&#39;<br />I hope the Cisco press won&#39;t mind if I inserted some of excerpt from the book.
