  html: I&#39;ve got router in turkey with a GRE tunnel to Belford and Florance. The
    ISP has made a change to their service and since that time the EIGRP relationship
    has been loosing the neighbors every 15 minutes on the money. Both neighbors are
    flapping at the same time!!!! We cannot find any evidence of a circuit issue.
    Until the root problem is resolved, is there a way to keep the flapping down?
    I&#39;ve already increased the hold timers to three minutes.

  html: It&#39;s pretty hard to diagnose something like this over a blog. You should
    really open a case with Cisco TAC or whoever your support partner is.

  html: It also depends on the kind of traffic u pass through between the tunnels.  Make
    sure ur network is not congested and all ur QoS settings are properly tuned.
