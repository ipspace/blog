  html: '"You might have wondered why no link-state routing protocols support unequal-cost
    load balancing"... Isnt that precisely what TE metrics let you do with an MPLS
    backbone?'

  html: You're absolutely correct (see my <A HREF="http://www.nil.si/ipcorner/LoadSharingTE/"
    REL="nofollow">Perfect load balancing</A> article for details) ... but why is
    the UCLB functionality not available in pure OSPF/IS-IS?

  html: In my opinion - <br /><br />I believe UCLB is possible, but it will require  major
    changes to the SPF algorithm, mainly becuase SPF doesn't know what lies ahead
    - it grows from the the root to the leaves. so calculating an alternative path,
    for EVERY node and checking the FC for it (the implication would be not to remove
    the root neighbor node's triplet from the TENT list until it is checked agianst
    every node that enters the PATH list, for the FC), when just in the building process
    seems quite intense.<br /><br />Link state protocols get raw data and calculate
    the SPF tree. Distance vector protocols get processed data - they don't have to
    run any calculations, just pick the lowest.<br /><br />So i am guessing implementing
    UCLB in distance vector protocols (or OSPF inter-area), by adding communication
    of advertised distances between neighbors, will be less difficult to implement
    than in OSPF/IS-IS intra-area.

  html: There has been some work on link-state protocols with splitting over non-shortest
    paths, by putting exponentially diminishing fractions of the traffic on longest
    paths.  This actually works quite well and can, in fact, enable "optimal" traffic
    engineering simply by tuning the links weights.  See, for instance, the work in:<br

    going to get stuck in those for the few next days :)'

  html: That will prone to cause routing loops in my opinion. Especially when a path
    / router goes down and SPF needs to recalculate again on an UCLB Network...

  html: Actually, the UCLB question could be answered in terms of histroy and features.
    The designers of OSPF and IS-IS at their time of origination never envisioned
    the type of networks we would have today and even during their protocol evolution
    over time to factor that &quot;feature&quot; in. The other consideration is that
    the mold was made for these protocols and integration of UCLB would be too difficult
    and costly for the many distros of the protocols. <br />Now UCLB can be &quot;added&quot;
    on top of the routing protocol just like another policy routing type feature or
    feature in general. Look at BFD and Ethernet CFM that could have been designed
    in the beginning but it was not and thus now it is available as an option to enhance
    the underlying protocols operation.<br /><br />So, maybe in IOS 16 we will get
    a UCLB knob for OSPF and IS-IS.
