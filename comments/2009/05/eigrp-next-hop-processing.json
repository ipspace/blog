      "html": "I labed this up using ethernet ( same broadcast domain) and tried using no ip next-hop-self eigrp *AS* it didn't make any difference, when i sniffed the EIGRP update packet both times(with and without next hop self) the Next hop address = 0.0.0.0 <br /><br />i thought if i made the destination network a internal eigrp route the next hop self would work so i blocked eigrp packets between the source and the destination and added the destination network to eigrp, this way the source has to learn the route from the intermediate still didn't change anything.<br /><br />i have a GNS3 DMVPN lab around somewhere, it might be worth getting that out and looking what it does to the next hop address in the eigrp update packet.<br /><br />cheers",
