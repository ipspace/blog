  html: This type of problem seen when IGP as OSPF becasue OSPF adverise loopback
    as stub network. What will happen if ISIS is used?<br /><br />We can use the ip
    ospf network point to point to avoid the problem.<br /><br />regards<br />shivlu

  html: Shivlu, you will see this behaviour because ospf advertises loopbacks as /32.
    But even if you change it using ip os net point-to-point, you will STILL see the
    same behaviour.<br /><br />Thanks a lot Sir Ivan for clearing this. I asked this
    query and surely cleared my confusion. Thanks again.

  html: Can you explain the aggregate tag behavior, as the book exactly says the same
    for untagged and aggregate. Whats different. Or is this Cisco thing !
