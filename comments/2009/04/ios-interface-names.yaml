  html: Dot (.) also serves to identify an au-4 or au-3 on an multichannel STM-1 port
    adaptor.

  html: Slot 1:<BR/>Channelized STM-1 (SMI) Port adapter, 1 port<BR/><BR/>Se1/0.1/1/2/2:3<BR/><BR/>These
    are some of the strangest interface identifiers i've seen

  html: The D channel in ISDN is usually referred to as :23 or :15 (depending on whether
    it is a T1 or E1). But sometimes, it is ":D".<BR/>So, you would see something
    like "voice-port 3:D"

  html: A couple of interesting cases:<BR/><BR/>TwinGig converters play a funny game.  My
    TwinGig-capable Sup 6-E in slot 3 uses the follwing names to describe its pair
    of tengig interfaces:<BR/>Te3/1<BR/>Te3/2<BR/>Gi3/3<BR/>Gi3/4<BR/>Gi3/5<BR/>Gi3/6<BR/><BR/>The
    four Gigabit ports are the ones I <I>would</I> have if twingig converters were
    installed.  They're not.  Config elements for all 6 interfaces persist in the
    configuration, regardless of what hardware is installed.<BR/><BR/>This seems to
    indicate the intention to prevent multiple types of interface (gig and tengig)
    from landing on the same interface numbers, otherwise the gigabit ports would
    be numbered from 1 and not from 3.<BR/><BR/>But the 2621 router flies in the face
    of that thinking.  It's got s0/0, s0/1, fa0/0 and fa0/1.<BR/><BR/>Frankly, I prefer
    the Sup 6-E logic

  html: Whilst the STM1 card appears strange, it really isn't.<br /><br />Se1/0.1/1/2/2:3<br
    /><br />Is Port 0 of card 1 (as per the article), with JKLM 1122 (google KLM numbering)
    channel 3 (i.e. the 3rd 64Kb channel of the specified 2Mb circuit of the STM1.)

  html: The show controllers command accepts interface type and number only with space
    in between, like Serial 0/1, not Serial0/1. It is a good practice to use this
    format throughout.

  html: Speaking of Twingigs, the 3560E-12D behaves in yet another manner. <br /><br
    />There are 12 X2 interfaces, which gives a possible 24 Twingig interfaces. <br
    /><br />Gi0/1<br />Gi0/2<br />..<br />Gi0/23<br />Gi0/24<br /><br />Te0/1<br />Te0/2<br
    />..<br />Te0/11<br />Te0/12
