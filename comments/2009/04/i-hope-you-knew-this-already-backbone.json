      "html": "Many of us did know this - my current employer uses various carriers' l3vpn services extensively, and we've always been worried about the possibility for issues like this, as well as the potential for occasional misconfigurations (which has happened to us several times - VRF/CoS misconfigurations where, say, EF-tagged traffic ends up shunted to some other VRF).  The other problem that we've needed to solve is persistent MPLS blackhole events - LSP failures (of whatever sort) that don't express themselves as route withdrawals at the PER.  Run enough IPSLA across these networks and you'll find that it's a relatively constant issue (to the extent that it interferes with real-time flows), regardless of provider.  So, running mGRE/IPSEC from remote sites tends to ameliorate both problems, assuming adjacencies across the tunnels, and tunnels across different MPLS cores so that you can fail away from one of those events.<br /><br />Radia Perlman's paper on \"Routing with Byzantine Robustness\" is an interesting read, when considering these issues - she ends up at a similar stance: encrypt it all in stateful tunnels.  I do think that the blackholes we've seen are a good example of a byzantine network failure (i.e., PER claiming to have reachability to a given prefix, when it does not).",
