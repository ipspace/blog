            <div class="comment-content">This is a good tip but I had trouble doing this when using snmp version 1. All traps were still getting sent to the host. I had to use v2c and then it worked. Doesn't see like a difference in the protocol versions, just the way IOS behaves. <br /><br />I also blogged a scenario showing what I found:<br /><br />http://ccietobe.blogspot.com/2009/02/snmp-sending-traps-to-specific-hosts.html<br /><br />Have you experienced this? Maybe just a bug in the IOS I was using, though I don't recall what version it was.</div>
