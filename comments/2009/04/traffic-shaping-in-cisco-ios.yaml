    html: '#1 - A router never slices the packets while shaping them. The whole packet
      goes into the shaping queue until enough tokens accumulate to let it pass.<br
      /><br />#2 - Yes, they&#39;re unrelated. What you can or cannot configure is
      a different matter (and I haven&#39;t tracked that for years).'

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I&#39;ve read your article at http://wiki.nil.com/Traffic_shaping_in_Cisco_IOS
    and that is a great explanation about the operation of traffic shaping. I still
    have some questions and I hope you can make it clear to me:<br /><br />1/ Assume
    Bc = 8000 bits and a 1500-byte (12000-bit) packet comes to the router. Will the
    router put the whole packet into shaping queue, or will it send the first 8000
    bits of the packet and waiting for the next Tc to send the remaining 4000 bits?<br
    /><br />2/ Are the shaping queue and the software (output) queue unrelated queues?
    For example, we configure the router to use CBWFQ for the shaping queue, and WFQ
    for the software queue. Assume shaping is active and TX Ring is full, the packet
    will be put into one of the class queues of the shaping queue, and then requeued
    into one of the dynamic flow queues of the software queue. Is that right?<br /><br
    />Your idea would be greatly appreciated !
