My TwinGig-capable Sup 6-E in slot 3 uses the follwing names to describe its pair of tengig interfaces:<BR/>Te3/1<BR/>Te3/2<BR/>Gi3/3<BR/>Gi3/4<BR/>Gi3/5<BR/>Gi3/6<BR/><BR/>The four Gigabit ports are the ones I <I>would</I> have if twingig converters were installed.  They're not.  Config elements for all 6 interfaces persist in the configuration, regardless of what hardware is installed.<BR/><BR/>This seems to indicate the intention to prevent multiple types of interface (gig and tengig) from landing on the same interface numbers, otherwise the gigabit ports would be numbered from 1 and not from 3.<BR/><BR/>But the 2621 router flies in the face of that thinking.  It's got s0/0, s0/1, fa0/0 and fa0/1.<BR/><BR/>Frankly, I prefer the Sup 6-E logic",
