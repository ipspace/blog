            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<BR/><BR/>Very interesting observation, looking at the modulo to determine if these share the same root cause.<BR/>I created a list of longest ASpaths per day, starting with February 1st.<BR/>I added a feature that checks if number of prepends matches the low-order 8 bits of the offending AS number. Indicating that it's likely caused by the same bug.<BR/>The list can be found here: <BR/>  <BR/>http://bgpmon.net/maxASpath.php<BR/><BR/>Interesting is that the first time this was observed was actually on February 9th. I didn't hear anyone talk about that. However I do know that one of my upstreams experienced BGP problems (flaps) exactly at the time of the update. <BR/><BR/>Keep up the good work,<BR/> Andree</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Fantastic tool. Will you post it to NANOG mailing list?<BR/><BR/>The huge impact on the Internet was caused by a Cisco bug, which was only triggered if the AS-path length was close enough to 255 and the AS-path prepending was used. <BR/><BR/>Obviously someone in the core was doing just the right amount of prepending to reset the BGP sessions and trigger the flood.<BR/><BR/>The first time the offending AS was far enough from the core that the eventual flaps were not noticed (although there had to be some non-IOS boxes in the path for you to get the AS-path length of 257).</div>
