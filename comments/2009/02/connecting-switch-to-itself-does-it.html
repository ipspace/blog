            <div class="comment-content">Actually, connecting the switch to itself, i.e. creating an external loopback is sometimes needed in order to perform certain functions not supported by the switch or port in question.<BR/><BR/>One of the common reasons is VLAN translation and the other one, slightly more obscure, is ability to create MPLS EoMPLS pseudowires on 6500/7600 series, while using "hybrid" L2/L3 environment.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">@Anonymous: You're absolutely right. With "portfast" you'll create a temporary loop until the STP kicks in. Or, if you're absolutely lucky, you have low-end switch that has no STP support :))<BR/><BR/>@Marko: There's another use for external loopback - you want to create a single switch out of two switching modules on low-end Cisco routers.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">How about a another similar question?<BR/><BR/>Connecting a router to itself? <BR/><BR/>We used it on our catalyst 6500 in order to put the packet shaping device "inline". We also used it to have vrf-lite communicate between the VRF and global routing table on the same device. Some mac-address and static arp entry have to be entered in order for them to communicate. In the CISCO network virtualization, if the FWSM in transparent mode, and you want to have routing between different VLANs in different VRF, you also need to add the mac-address and static arp entry.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">And what if you loop the switch on one port? i.e. creating a loop cable, or a more likely situation, connect a cisco switch with spanning tree to an absolute dumb switch, and the dumb switch is got looped (for example in a meeting room)? Does the STP recognize this as a loop? Does it have enough time for this? If the broadcast storm overwhelms the switch, and the switch will be unable to process incoming BPDU-s among the flood?  <BR/>Which outcome is likly? (suppose enough initial broadcast / sec, so the storm can start immediatelly)<BR/><BR/>Does someone have experience with this?<BR/><BR/>Balazs</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Balazs,<BR/><BR/>I've seen your scenario more than once where. A hub in a conference room connected to two switch ports will create a loop. <BR/><BR/>I've also seen a buggy virtual switch in a virtual host do it. Servers hosting VMs need multiple switch ports for redundancy and run simple virtual switches in them that don't do spanning tree. They also have bugs.<BR/><BR/>Broadcast and multicast gets looped first. On top of that, the CAM tables get flooded: from the perspective of your cisco switch, every broadcast now originates from the correct port, as well as the looped ports, so the looped ports keep accumulating MACs. As a result, even unicast traffic starts to get looped. <BR/><BR/>If you have BPDU guard, it will eventually kick in and the network will recover. <BR/><BR/>Few pointers:<BR/><BR/>- bpdu-guard is a must<BR/><BR/>- you don't want "errdisable recovery cause bpduguard", since it'll restart the cycle<BR/><BR/>- consider port-security with a small limit (we do 4 MACs). this prevents the second part of the problem, where the CAM table gets flooded, and it's a fail-safe to the bpdu-guard. <BR/><BR/>Igor.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">A fun way I found in the past to crash a Cisco 3550 switch was to configure a port with an IP addresses, and loop that port back into the same switch on a layer 2 port. It would crash the switch every time, no matter the spanning tree configuration.</div>
