  html: i agree something is needed to extend routing based on performance measurements..
    <BR/><BR/>We (IP) is never going to be serious unless we are able to route around
    link degradation rather then up/down.<BR/><BR/>We have OER (PfR) for the edge,
    and similar on phone switches, so people are clearly thinking about it.<BR/><BR/>Also
    there is this http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2676.html. <BR/><BR/>Although (not having
    read it) i guess it would need to signal latency &gt; xms = link down or something
    like that.<BR/><BR/>I dont think it is possible to use Diffserv TE to setup a
    path based on jitter/pkt loss... iirc only constraints such as bandwidth, colour
    are possible etc.
