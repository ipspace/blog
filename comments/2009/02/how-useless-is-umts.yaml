  html: "Hi,<BR/><BR/>Some of my customers have a running UMTS like \u0160tefan scenario\
    \ a branch office with IPSec+GRE to the central office. We used German Telecom\
    \ and Vodafone. With a good connection or in other words with HSDPA it works well,\
    \ even with VOIP (Siemens Highpath). We have a round trip time of ~100Ms and a\
    \ ugly jitter but it works... <BR/>With EDGE or GPRS was no way for VOIP and normal\
    \ working  was not satisfying.<BR/><BR/>My Opinion: UMTS Backup is ugly. Some\
    \ (most?) providers assigning RFC-1918 IP adresses and/or filter inbound traffic.\
    \ There is no way to get always the same IP (public) adress. The Connections are\
    \ not reliable because of rain, snow, breathing cells, to many cell-user or whatever.\
    \ But there some pro's: the cost is relatively low and sometimes there are no\
    \ alternative (no means no or high priced) lines available.<BR/><BR/>If possible\
    \ i prefer any other cable based Backup."

  html: hello,<BR/><BR/>Latency is well known problem since 3g (2000). It improved
    with HSDPA...<BR/><BR/>3gpp LTE looks to solve this...

  html: A lot of the latency is at the RF edge. But the carriers try and compensate
    with extremely high speed IP backbones. A lot of it is going to have to do with
    your location, obviously, and how close you are to a Internet peering point on
    the carrier's network.

  html: '...sure if you see something like https://www.swe.siemens.com/belux/portal/en/press/press/releases/cc/PublishingImages/012_umts_antenna_1102517.jpg
    <BR/>from the position of your umts device you have a good chance of success ;-)'

  html: Anonymous is not entirely correct. True the latency comes at the edge. But
    I don't see how having high speed backbones makes any difference or compensates
    in any form.<BR/><BR/>They tend to be over-provisioned and look like any other
    fixed line carrier backbone. ie. MPLS<BR/><BR/>Latency in the backbone is basically
    the propagation delay which is fixed to physics and any additional latency would
    be variable queueing delay but this is designed in as to not be excessive, certainly
    in low latency classes.
