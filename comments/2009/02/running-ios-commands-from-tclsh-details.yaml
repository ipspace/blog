  html: You have to be careful with the ios_config command in Tclsh.  Some config
    modes require an explicit &quot;end&quot; command passed to them to properly exit
    out of the config mode and ios_config does not do this for you.  The most glaring
    example is EEM applet config mode.  If you use ios_config to configure an eem
    applet and forget to add an &quot;end&quot; command to the end of the list, that
    applet will be stuck - can&#39;t modify it, can&#39;t remove it, all you can do
    is reload.
