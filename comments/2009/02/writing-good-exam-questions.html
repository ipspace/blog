            <p class="comment-content">Been involved in MikroTik MTCNA exam lately, and it was just that - &quot;direct quote from the student notes&quot;. And they are in fact &quot;actively encourage instructors to contribute their questions&quot;, but it does&#39;nt help the questions quality. CCNA questions are much much better in terms of testing understanding of fundamentals.</p>
