            <div class="comment-content">i agree something is needed to extend routing based on performance measurements.. <BR/><BR/>We (IP) is never going to be serious unless we are able to route around link degradation rather then up/down.<BR/><BR/>We have OER (PfR) for the edge, and similar on phone switches, so people are clearly thinking about it.<BR/><BR/>Also there is this http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2676.html. <BR/><BR/>Although (not having read it) i guess it would need to signal latency &gt; xms = link down or something like that.<BR/><BR/>I dont think it is possible to use Diffserv TE to setup a path based on jitter/pkt loss... iirc only constraints such as bandwidth, colour are possible etc.</div>
