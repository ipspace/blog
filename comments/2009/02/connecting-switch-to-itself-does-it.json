A hub in a conference room connected to two switch ports will create a loop. <BR/><BR/>I've also seen a buggy virtual switch in a virtual host do it. Servers hosting VMs need multiple switch ports for redundancy and run simple virtual switches in them that don't do spanning tree. They also have bugs.<BR/><BR/>Broadcast and multicast gets looped first. On top of that, the CAM tables get flooded: from the perspective of your cisco switch, every broadcast now originates from the correct port, as well as the looped ports, so the looped ports keep accumulating MACs. As a result, even unicast traffic starts to get looped. <BR/><BR/>If you have BPDU guard, it will eventually kick in and the network will recover. <BR/><BR/>Few pointers:<BR/><BR/>- bpdu-guard is a must<BR/><BR/>- you don't want \"errdisable recovery cause bpduguard\", since it'll restart the cycle<BR/><BR/>- consider port-security with a small limit (we do 4 MACs). this prevents the second part of the problem, where the CAM table gets flooded, and it's a fail-safe to the bpdu-guard. <BR/><BR/>Igor.",
