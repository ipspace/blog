      "html": "It&#39;s worth considering that FC is what I would consider to be a stateful protocol. We have had many stateful protocols over the years such as RSVP, ATM, Frame Relay, RTSP Streaming, SNA, Time Division Multiplexing, Telephony  etc etc, the list goes on and on. <br /><br />All stateful protocols have failed comprehensively and never last more than a few years after an alternative exists. <br /><br />On this basis, FC is a &#39;dead man walking&#39;. FCoE is merely a migration technology for what is overpriced &#39;storage technology&#39; that hasn&#39;t been fully depreciated. Yet.",

Storage is no green screen.<br /><br />This not withstanding, IP is not destined to be an I/O bus technology.  Is the hypothesis here that you&#39;ll attach your IP hard disk with a CAT5 cable to your IP hard disk controller on your server?",
