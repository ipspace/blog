  html: Wow.<br /><br />I suppose one of tne of the benefits of running a blog without
    any commercial ties is that I&#39;m free to answer requests like that as creatively
    as possible. For starters, the &quot;procedure to be followed to inform the rest
    of the Internet that I own this pool&quot; is definitely a formal Usenet posting
    to alt.tools.

  html: Ivan<br /><br />I think you should answer him that this is not Microsoft trial
    version which is used free of cost with limited edition  :-P.

  html: Amazing. You could actually buy the hardware you&#39;ve recommended  8-) Although
    you&#39;d probably have to program the UDP/IP stack yourself.<br /><br />BTW,
    C64 is needed only if you have numerous zone files, otherwise you can use a Sinclair
    ZX81. It would give you 8KB space for your firmware (only wimps would program
    DNS in BASIC anyway) and 16KB for your zone files.

  html: Actually, there is an open source TCP/IP stack written for 8 bit micro-controllers,
    and was already used to wire C64 into the Internet.<br />http://www.v3.co.uk/vnunet/news/2118399/commodore-back-web-server<br
    /><br />ZX Spectrum won&#39;t do, because it has no cartridge slots. Sinclair&#39;s
    engineers seemed not to be so future-aware as Commodore&#39;s.  :-P

  html: Amazing, and even more amazing, a few hours of research will answer all those
    questions bar &#39;how to configure BIND / how to use linux&#39;. In fact a call
    to the local ISP&#39;s level 2 support will answer all those questions (with &#39;don&#39;t
    worry about it pay us 30 bucks a month and problem solved; lol). <br /><br />Funny
    thing is with the scope of the guy&#39;s questions it does suggest he is of sufficient
    technical depth to grasp the topic!!!  <br /><br />And don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve
    received more hostile responses on free online forums from amateurs who feel entitled
    to harangue people for cisco knowledge (and you know first hand how difficult
    it can be to describe some stuff via online posts).
