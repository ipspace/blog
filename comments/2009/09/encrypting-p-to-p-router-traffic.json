The CEP1000 offers full-duplex line rate encryption at 1.9Gbps using the AES encryption algorithm.",

      "html": "Are there only 2 P with one point-to-point link?? <br />You can use 2 devices to do crypto (find the ones that can handle your bandwidth requirement) between your P and do xconnect of L2tpv3 over IPSec. It might sound like complex but it works. Like any tunnel solution MTU comes in the picture but with GigEth, increasing that on the P-t-P link should not be a problem. The advantage of such a solution is to keep the P configuration standard and seen as directly connected (like the CEP option mentioned by Andrew)<br /><br />Other alternative that might be worth exploring (no idea if it can match your topology):<br /><br />GET VPN: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps7180/index.html<br /><br />Andrew&#39;s proposal is interesting as well !",
