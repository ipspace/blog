      "html": "RFC 5375 gives guidelines for subnet allocations.  But as I understand it, it boils down to this:  you receive your new /48 from the provider (or bigger if you deserve). The /48 will be carved out so each site is assigned a /56 which is 256 /64 subnets.  Physical subnets and VLANs within sites should be assigned /64 regardless if they deserved smaller or point-to-point /126 or /127, which might save you the future headaches.  So, I guess the task at hand is figuring out how this integrates in the various DMZs.",
