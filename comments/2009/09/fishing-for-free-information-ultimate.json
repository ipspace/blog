You could actually buy the hardware you&#39;ve recommended  8-) Although you&#39;d probably have to program the UDP/IP stack yourself.<br /><br />BTW, C64 is needed only if you have numerous zone files, otherwise you can use a Sinclair ZX81. It would give you 8KB space for your firmware (only wimps would program DNS in BASIC anyway) and 16KB for your zone files.",
