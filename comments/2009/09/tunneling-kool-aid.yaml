  html: It&#39;s worth considering that FC is what I would consider to be a stateful
    protocol. We have had many stateful protocols over the years such as RSVP, ATM,
    Frame Relay, RTSP Streaming, SNA, Time Division Multiplexing, Telephony  etc etc,
    the list goes on and on. <br /><br />All stateful protocols have failed comprehensively
    and never last more than a few years after an alternative exists. <br /><br />On
    this basis, FC is a &#39;dead man walking&#39;. FCoE is merely a migration technology
    for what is overpriced &#39;storage technology&#39; that hasn&#39;t been fully
    depreciated. Yet.

  html: I don&#39;t think it is appropriate to extrapolate the SNA experience to storage.  Storage
    is no green screen.<br /><br />This not withstanding, IP is not destined to be
    an I/O bus technology.  Is the hypothesis here that you&#39;ll attach your IP
    hard disk with a CAT5 cable to your IP hard disk controller on your server?

  html: and the bus connecting your disks inside your iSCSI storage is FC.

  html: I guess it helps the &quot;converged&quot; networking salespeople to try to
    perpetuate &quot;DWDM is prohibitively expensive&quot;.<br />If you have access
    to &quot;dark&quot; (i.e. you light it) fiber leased or self owned then DWDM gear
    is affordable (e.g. MRV www.mrv.com). It is an enabler. You can hang on to your
    FC investment. You can mux analog video over it. You can provision any type of
    service for which there is a DWDM service card or device available. <br />A passive
    MUX / DEMUX does not care what gear is connected to it, it only cares that it
    is the right lambda.<br /><br />
