    html: Well, you wouldn&#39;t do that for the management VLAN ;) <br /><br />For
      customer VLANs it makes sense - if the switch is one of the HSRP peers, you
      wouldn&#39;t want it to be active if it has zero client connections in that
      VLAN.

  html: "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />You say &quot;Most commonly you\u2019d want to exclude\

  html: 'Ivan, <br /><br />it&#39;s exactly the other way round: you never want to
    exclude an uplink from autostate - I learned it the hard way (see my other comment).
    You only want to exclude flapping access-ports from autostate calculation to prevent
    that a flapping access-ports tears down the SVI.<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br

  html: Struggling with a SVI on a Nexus4k.<br /><br />SVI down/down, but vlan is
    active on port-channel to N5K.<br /><br />Is the up/down status only influenced
    by local ports having the vlan active or also by upstream switch (cdp etc.) ?<br
    /><br />

  html: On a 6500 12.2(17d)SXB6 my SVI is up/down even though I have trunk ports that
    have that VLAN in STP forwarding state. I have no access ports in that VLAN but
    I would have thought that a trunk port in forwarding state for that vlan would
    allow the associated SVI to come active. Any ideas?<br />Kind Regards,<br />Peter
