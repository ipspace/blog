  html: 'Simply had to try the Google Reader myself. Here are the stats reported for
    various URLs through which my RSS feed is reachable:<br /><br />http://ioshints.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default<br
    />(obsolete): 2544 subscribers<br /><br />http://blog.ioshints.info/feeds/posts/default<br
    />596 subscribers<br /><br />http://feeds.feedburner.com/CiscoIosHintsAndTricks<br
    />(redirect to FeedBurner) 243 subscribers<br /><br />And thanks for uncovering
    another interesting Google Reader behavior (it does not check where the actual
    feed resides).'

  html: '@Pete: Nice to hear from someone in my local language ;)<br /><br />@Anonymous#2:
    Feedburner reports 230+ users using Firefox live bookmarks (and only 19 of them
    use FeedReader like I do). What counts is that your RSS agent periodically fetches
    the feed.'
