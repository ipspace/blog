      "html": "I have to be honest and say that this seems like a lot of work just to get a PNG onto the web when a simple &quot;Save As&quot; from Visio does the trick.  From memory, I first started using Visio at version 4, and although I agree with you that (in the best Microsoft tradition) it has bloated since those days, I have also never had any major performance problems all the way through to the latest 2007 version.<br /><br />Maybe it&#39;s time to upgrade your laptop?  ;-)",

The icon color isn&#39;t much of a problem , you could always macro them in photoshop and make them any shade of any color.<br /><br />I personally use Dia (Diagram Editor) which works under *nix. I use the cisco icons too (bw) in Dia and it can produce some very nice diagrams.<br /><br />It also works for windows too.",

I want to control the size of the icons and have somewhat antialiased picture ... but for a simple job, direct save into HTML/PNG is the best.<br /><br />Just tried the PPT save-as-PNG functionality. Works, but the text looks so 1970ish.",

Earlier this year though, I discovered OmniGraffle Pro which does so many good things and makes diagramming a real pleasure.  Plus it&#39;s got some limited interoperability with Visio.  I can open most documents, use all the stencils, and export to the Visio XML format.",

I think I will be testing it out in Wine on Linux tonight.<br /><br />I just wanted to toss it out there that for my Wiki I use Graphviz http://www.graphviz.org/ you don&#39;t have to &quot;draw&quot; anything you just learn the syntax for the drawings and you feed it in to wiki page.  Once you save the page and view it your Wiki generates a PNG file of the drawing for you and presents it on that page. You can draw boxes and connect them differently.  If you have PNG files like the Cisco Icons you can put them in the drawing too.  I like it because it turns a drawing into a Wiki Page so everyone can have input on it.",

It works for him.<br /><br />Hell, if microsoft stops providing updates to your old OS and programs, then you can always install linux on it and then you can keep the machine doing whatever you did before, forever. Until linux is no longer updated.  :-D<br /><br />You shouldn&#39;t throw out old hardware that works. It&#39;s bad for the environment and costly.",
