      "html": "Hey Ivan,<br /><br />Netflix uses an embedded web-based video player for streaming content on the PC so they are actually using tcp via port 80. A quick wireshark capture confirms:<br /><br />GET /s/d4/087/354617087.wmv?e=1247617384&amp;h=b171572900473556e71d585c8e4d3479 HTTP/1.1\\r\\n<br /><br />Request URI: /s/d4/087/354617087.wmv?e=1247617384&amp;h=b171572900473556e71d585c8e4d3479<br /><br />and then the subsequent TCP segments follow.<br /><br />I can&#39;t speak to the XBOX or other standalone implementations but I assume they use delivery via HTTP as well. Interesting to note the windows media container for video content.<br /><br />Hope that helps.<br /><br />-Steve",
