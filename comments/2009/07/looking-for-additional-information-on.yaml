  html: Capture of the initial session setup and a short capture sometime during the

  html: I will give you a hint.<br />Netflix does not distribute content themselves.
    Why would they bother with that when they can cut a big contract with a Tier 1
    provider?<br />If you look at Tier 1 providers, you will have no trouble figuring
    out which one Netflix is working with.

  html: 'Hey Ivan,<br /><br />Netflix uses an embedded web-based video player for
    streaming content on the PC so they are actually using tcp via port 80. A quick
    wireshark capture confirms:<br /><br />GET /s/d4/087/354617087.wmv?e=1247617384&amp;h=b171572900473556e71d585c8e4d3479
    HTTP/1.1\r\n<br /><br />Request URI: /s/d4/087/354617087.wmv?e=1247617384&amp;h=b171572900473556e71d585c8e4d3479<br
    /><br />and then the subsequent TCP segments follow.<br /><br />I can&#39;t speak
    to the XBOX or other standalone implementations but I assume they use delivery
    via HTTP as well. Interesting to note the windows media container for video content.<br
    /><br />Hope that helps.<br /><br />-Steve'

    based on packet capture provided by volcker gave me all the answers I needed.<br
    /><br />@Steve: Thanks!'
