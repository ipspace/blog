            <div class="comment-content">Hi,<br /><br />WIMAX is just on the road to eventually having super high speed mobile broadband WITH COMPARABLE LATENCY to fixed line. Not 100% sure where it fits in the road.. I.e. a competitor of LTE or a step to LTE (I suspect the former) But it is beyond current HSDPA/HSUPA which you could call 3.5G perhaps.<br /><br />Anyhow, the back-haul is becoming all IP already. Goes (very roughly)something like this.<br /><br />Mobile-Air/Radio(WIMAX/HSDPA/EDGE/GPRS/HSUPA/LTE)--NodeB--(IP Backhaul)--RNC--(IP/SS7)---SGSN(Data)/MSS/MWG(Voice)--MPLS Backbone--Foreign networks (Like the internet)<br /><br />The above does not include the evolution to R5/R6 IMS (converged fixed/mobile) since it hasn&#39;t exactly taken off.<br /><br />The specifications evolve in releases from R99(3g)-R4(IP Voice Core network)-R5,R6 (IMS)-R7-R8 (LTE) etc .. They basically evolve different parts of the network. For example R4 is enhanced Voice core network over IP. <br /><br />So apart from disrupting the mobile phones and potential new hardware/software in radio equipment there will be no disruption on the backbone networks (apart from upgrading to cope with increased capacity and general evolution of the Core voice and packet networks -- I guess this is a disruption but only in the same way fixed line networks have evolved from 7500 days to CRS. Same will be true of the mobile backbones now all on their way to CRS or equivlent ).<br /><br />To carry the analogy further, it is the equivalent of turning you ADSL to FTTC (If I am not over egging it)<br /><br />cheers<br /><br /><br />The actual protocols for handling both data and voice traffic over mobile networks are well defined in 3GPP specs (let me know if you want some ;-) ) <br /><br />cheers</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Thanks for the details. What I meant as &quot;disruptive&quot; was the potential effect Wimax might have on existing wireless (3/3.5G) infrastructure. <br /><br />If Wimax wins, most of the 3G infrastructure will go the same way as Frame Relay/ATM gear did.</div>
