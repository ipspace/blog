The pew paper brings up another - they did not control for the service type, so maybe the expensive service is 3G cell data.<br /><br />Unfortunately, we don&#39;t have enough data to settle this.<br /><br />However, the idea that competition reduces prices is inline with current economic theory.<br /><br />Here&#39;s my observation: <br /><br />I live in an urban part of a major metro area.<br />I get both TV and Internet from Comcast. <br /><br />The TV price goes up every year, with small to no improvement in service. The ISP price hardly changes - I don&#39;t know if it even matches inflation - and they&#39;ve doubled or tripled the speed. <br /><br />I have exactly 1 choice for cable TV, and 2 choices for broadband Internet.<br /><br />At the same time, if the ISP speed tripled, the PC speed and storage size improved by a factor of 8 or 10.",

      "html": "I am involved in the  purchase  of hundreds of thousands of dollars per month of network services, mostly high speed circuits from local and regional providers, from DS3 to 10Gig. (Commercial, not consumer).<br /><br />In our service area, we see:<br /><br />High population density, high cost<br />High population density, low cost<br />Low population density, high cost<br />Low population density, low cost<br /><br />From my experience the difference between high and low cost is that we have low cost where there is both competition AND excess capacity. I don&#39;t see an automatic correlation between population density and price, nor do I see an automatic correlation between competition and price.<br /><br />To give you an idea  - I have a quote for 10Mpbs ethernet from a provider in a wealthy, high density community that has  no competition, and I have a quote for for 10Gbps in a low population density community a few miles away where there is both competition and excess capacity. The quotes 10Mbps is within 10% of the quote for 10Gbps. <br /><br />Unfortunately  my data is anecdotal &amp; specific to a particular region and therefor of limited value.",
