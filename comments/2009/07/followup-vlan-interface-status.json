      "html": "Ivan, <br /><br />it&#39;s exactly the other way round: you never want to exclude an uplink from autostate - I learned it the hard way (see my other comment). You only want to exclude flapping access-ports from autostate calculation to prevent that a flapping access-ports tears down the SVI.<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />MiKa",

I have no access ports in that VLAN but I would have thought that a trunk port in forwarding state for that vlan would allow the associated SVI to come active.
