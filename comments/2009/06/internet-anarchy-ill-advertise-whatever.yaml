  html: 'While a good amount of this is likely inefficient policy, there is at least
    one solid excuse for advertising deaggregated routes: it mitigates address space
    hijacking (in my opinion, a vastly underestimated threat). Until upstream BGP
    filtering is made more consistent across providers worldwide, this will continue
    to be a motivator.'

  html: '@Stretch: I have to disagree. There are <a href="http://iar.cs.unm.edu/alerts.php"
    rel="nofollow">free</a> or <a href="http://www.renesys.com/products_services/routing_intelligence/"
    rel="nofollow">commercial</a> services that can alert you when you address space
    is being hijacked. <br /><br />Unfortunately the only short-term response you
    have available to combat the hijack is the advertisement of deaggregated /24s,
    but that does not warrant announcing deaggregated routes by default.'

  html: Badly managed internet connections advertising more specifics &quot;unnecessarily&quot;
    have no motivation to NOT do so. <br /><br />Moreover, it is human nature in such
    an enviroment as the Internet that some people will have zero Internet Etiquette.  <br
    /><br />So rather than solve the unsolvable (changing human nature) why not come
    up with a solution that accounts for this &quot;anti-social&quot; behaviour.<br
    /><br />i.e. don&#39;t try and change the world try and get solutions that fit
    the world.<br /><br />cheers<br />Bad Designer (de-aggregating since 1924)

  html: The solution is in transit networks, as usual. Either due to absence of clue,
    will or lazyness, most of them implement no consistent filtering policies. If
    all carriers would by default filter at RIR-allocation boundaries for each of
    their customers, we would have much happier world.<br /><br />Alas, many of these
    transit carriers fit into what Bad Designer talked about.

  html: Unfortunatly alot of cases come down to money - the root of most problems.
    Lets say you can afford 2 GE connections to the Internet. You need to load share
    since you have more than 1G of traffic so you deaggregate your blocks. If you
    could afford 2 10GE, you could do active/passive with no deaggregation. Now imaging
    this problem spread across several POPs with several Internet connections. You
    know the problem exists. You want to fix it but you can&#39;t get money to buy
    larger pipes... What do you do?

  html: '@Ivan: Detection is great, but it does absolutely nothing to mitigate an
    attack. Responding by injecting more granular routes as you mention is a purely
    *reactionary* measure; damage has already been done by this point. Many organizations,
    where inaccessibility is measured in millions of dollars per minute,  simply aren&#39;t
    willing to risk the hours of downtime that a potential attack (accidental or otherwise)
    could cost.<br /><br />As I said, the only presently available solution for this
    is to raise confidence in the filtering undertaken by major autonomous systems
    across the globe; obviously not an easy thing to do.'

  html: I am on the SP side, and while advertising aggregated routes is the normal
    procedure,there are always overriding imperatives . More specific routes  is the
    easiest and fastest way of load manipulation. E.g. if some major <br />client
    is having problems with latency going through upstream provider A , easiest way
    to <br />get him satisfied is to advertise more specific<br />prefix through SP
    B as a temporary solution. <br />BTW SPs abroad do the same thing in advertisings
    to us , so ...

  html: If registrars would hold a field for &quot;upstreams&quot; a customer could
    register what ASes they (may) advertise to.  Using this information any AS path
    could be evaluated for consistency or hijacks.<br /><br />Much like providers
    today who don&#39;t bother to use prefix-list to filter what a customer can advertise
    to them, it would rely on the providers to be upstanding netizens, but it would
    at least make the information available to providers who wished to take such steps
    to prevent hijacking.

  html: More on this is that upstream uses local preference to utilize their directly
    connected clients links,,,<br />means if you are advertising a /19 prefix to Level3
    and same prefix to France telecom and as-path prepend to France telecom for /19
    will not work as local preference will be first attribute to be in consideration
    @ france telecom and traffic will continue on that link for france telecom directly
    clients,,,<br /><br />unless you play with more complex BGP community attributes  :&#39;(

  html: There are ways to get around this problem (although complex). However, as
    I wrote in the post, the traffic engineered prefixes are not included in the report
    (because, if you do it right, they would have different AS paths).
