  html: I followed the conversation on NANOG with much pleasure, from both the pro-
    and the con-side of the argument, regardless of RFC-&#39;legality&#39;. <br /><br
    />If I recall correctly the argument started because of loadbalancing/high availability
    issues.<br /><br />It gets even more interesting if you allow the host to bridge
    between these interfaces and an HA virtual interface, although I think that bundeling
    (bonding) of the interfaces the &#39;cleanest&#39; solution is. Ofcourse there
    are some problems if your aggeregate is spanned over multiple switches because
    of HA demands, which often forces the use of active/passive constructions.<br
    /><br />Luckily switch-cluster technology (SMLT, VSS etc.) is becoming available
    on enterprise-grade hardware, which overcomes these problems. <br /><br />Question
    regarding the future, will there be host-implementations of L2MP? Oppertunity
    or headache?

  html: Several of our clients &quot;acomplished&quot; to implement multihomed servers
    generating a kind of &quot;assymetric routing&quot; which generated &quot;exessive
    unicast-flooding&quot;. In one case (paired with huge filetransfers) this resulted
    in periodical &quot;brownouts&quot; of there core. This &quot;phenomenon&quot;
    could/should be added to the issues section.

  html: 'There were several comments in the NANOG thread suggesting that exit interface
    and source IP address are necessarily correlated.<br /><br />This just isn&#39;t
    true.<br /><br />For connectionless protocols, and for the first (SYN) packet
    in a TCP session, the correlation *might* be there, but even that can be changed.<br
    /><br />Consider the &quot;source-interface&quot; set of IOS commands, which force
    the first packet in a session to ignore the exit interface.<br /><br />For a mid-session
    example, consider this:   I can ssh into the external interface of my linksys
    router from inside my home network.<br /><br />The exit interface of the response
    packet is the internal one, but the source address is the external one.<br /><br
    />I&#39;m suprised how many people got this wrong.'

  html: '@Anonymous: the misconceptions in the NANOG thread prompted me to write the
    Wiki article. <br /><br />If you go through the TCP/UDP portion of it, you&#39;ll
    see the exact correlation between the outgoing interface and source IP address
    (when and where it does exist).'
