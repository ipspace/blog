The &quot;whiners&quot; are people who work out the math and complain that the companies involved sell them one thing, then radically change the service when you actually try to use what they sold you. Regardless of whatever claimed necessity there is, that is a classic bait-and-switch on the part of the provider. Most consumers won&#39;t notice, and for most consumers there is no tangible difference, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that the SP is trying to dramatically reduce your service in response to you actually using the service you paid for.<br /><br />If this were being sold as a dedicated circuit, it would have to be billed as &quot;5GB/mo&quot; or &quot;2Kbps, burstable to 50Mbps&quot;, which are vastly different from the &quot;50mbps&quot; you originally bought.<br /><br />And you have the socialism vs. capitalism thing exactly backwards, by the way, which also detracts from your argument.",

      "html": "Once again I read another apologist post somehow claiming that the motivation for these new caps is somehow based on hardware costs and network expenses. To date not a single ISP that is proposing these caps has been able to justify this position. Comparisons to other utilities like electricity fail to take into account that these generate the product and THEN transmit it. If an ISP was saying \u201cHey we spend millions of dollars reporting the news and making new games and we need to get paid back\u201d then the comparison would be valid. An ISP is in the transmission business and nothing more.<br /><br />The real reason that these caps are being put in place is to prevent services like Netflix from directly competing with other services that ISPs provide. COX does not want you using Netflix on line since it eats into their profits from their cable services. Of course these ISPs are going to blame torrent users for the problems since all torrent users are evil child molesting,  terrorist sympathizing, pirates and must be doing something we need to stop. Then again no ISP has been able to provide read documented details on how much of their bandwidth is being used by torrent services compared to other usages. <br /><br />ISPs are making claims to try and justify their decisions so lock out competitors from the internet at the same time hiding any data that would support their numbers. Until we have complete transparency into the ISP that proves that usage caps are motivated solely by business needs of the ISP and not based on a desire to protect other parts of their business that cannot be tolerated.",

      "html": "No one&#39;s looking for &quot;all-you-can eat&quot; service. One expects his connection to be bound by the throughput limits as advertised in Mbps (a far more granular and technically useful metric than measuring transfer by the month); transfer caps are a *further* restriction being placed on what is already explicitly limited. Any need to treat differntly any two customers (one &quot;light&quot; and one &quot;heavy&quot;) subscribing to the same service plan is plainly a symptom of gross overprovisioning. Overprovisioning is of course an element in any network design, but many providers have pushed the tolerances too far and it&#39;s catching up to them.<br /><br />Additionally, it can&#39;t be conjectured that Internet service provision is an inherently unprofitable industry because one or several have failed to turn a profit in recent years. This would be akin to arguing that auto manufacturing is unprofitable because GM went bankrupt while ignoring the successes of Toyota.<br /><br />Unfortunately, those entrepeneurs who might have better ideas on how run an ISP face a staggering barrier to market entry. It seems that, despite their supposed inability to turn a profit, few companies are willing to relinquish their monopoly on a market or medium.",

While it may have seemed implausible five or ten years ago, such service is available today as a result of technological evolution.<br /><br />And before you counter that it isn&#39;t available, I&#39;ll mention that I have no issue saturating my 12/2 from Cox ($44/mo) at length. Obviously I&#39;m not running torrents 24/7 just to burn bits, but it&#39;s always there, as I&#39;ve paid for it to be there.<br /><br />You can&#39;t claim that a costomer is acting out of greed when he fairly consumes a service for which he has paid. If a user who has paid for a 5 Mbps connection began (somehow) using 10 Mbps, *that* would be unfair. You cannot fault him for using 5 Mbps, however.<br /><br />What&#39;s happening is the reverse: a service provider is telling that customer he can only use (for instance) 1 Mbps of the 5 Mbps he has paid for. So where&#39;s the greed?<br /><br />Additionally, the simple fact that there *are* Internet service providers is evidence enough that *someone* sees a profit to be made. Where there&#39;s demand, someone will supply it for a profit. I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t expect that they would operate at a loss out of the goodness of their  hearts.<br /><br />Regarding the lack of FTTH competition, I think you underestimate the influence of US telcos; some even have the balls to sue municipalities for deploying their own fiber networks: http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/09/telco-to-town-were-suing-you-because-we-care.ars (BTW, it seems copy &amp; paste doesn&#39;t work on the comment form.)<br /><br />Additionally, this idea simply doesn&#39;t scale. It makes no sense (and in many respects, is not physically possible) for multiple providers to each maintain an independent cable plant in parallel with the others. A much more elegant solution would be to entrust the maintenance of a common physical infrastructure to a local utility or third party. This leaves the choice of provider to the consumer, and benefits providers by significantly lowering their operating costs.",

And promising less is suicide, I&#39;m sure you can appreciate that.<br /><br />So you promise the full ADSL2+ bandwidth, or the full DOCSIS 3.0 bandwidth, as applies to your technology.<br /><br />That&#39;s the bandwidth the customer *will* have into your network btw. And there is NO way to guarantee connection to specific networks, so we simply don&#39;t make claims about that (unless you pay specifically for that), and don&#39;t provide it either. 50 mbps means 50 mbps into the lex, nothing more. Of course if you as a customer choose to read the impossible, that 50 mbps advertised means an ISP has x*50mbps to any possible destination, then please keep dreaming, join the communist party and bomb innocent people for utopia, like any good socialist does. <br /><br />Say I sell you a business 100 mpbs service. On an exchange I peer with the network you want to communicate with, but they&#39;ve only got a 10mbps connection on that exchange. Then you&#39;ll get 10 mbps only, nothing I can do about that.<br /><br />A while ago we had a problem with sparkle (Italy Telecom). Their peering connection was full and they refused to upgrade, citing costs. What, exactly should I do about that (the  problem still exists, so feel free to suggest tactics).<br /><br />Internet does not have unlimited bandwidth, 1 gbps is still a lot, and the absolute maximum bandwith I have to any one destination. So what do you suggest I do ? Create a nationwide 2-gigabit network to connect no more than 50 20mbps customers, because that&#39;s all I can guarantee ? And I still am not able to guarantee that those 1 gbps is not filled up by incoming traffic, either in a direct ddos attack or simply someone who&#39;s scp&#39;in the next version of ubuntu, or the new harry potter movie.<br /><br />If you&#39;re going to complain about &quot;users not getting what they paid for&quot;, you might want to give 5 seconds thought exactly how unrealistic you&#39;re being.<br /><br />I happen to have a degree in informatics, and with graph theory you can easily predict the necessary international bandwidth to guarantee that every network world-wide can talk to eachother with 1 kbps in a worst-case scenario. You know how much it is ? A bit over 20 Terabits per second. Know any network that has more than 10 gbit ? Would you perhaps prefer all peering connections to be limited to 1kbps, until international backbones like verizon, level3, cogent, etc. upgrade to 20 terabit network interfaces ? Then Isp&#39;s would at least have the option of &quot;delivering what they advertise&quot;. Of course it would also mean that you max. torrent speed is 1 kbps / number of subscribers.

Then he can download all day and feel he is getting what was advertised to him while paying as little as possible.<br /><br />My plan (Average Person Plan): Full bandwidth with reasonable data transfer limits (i.e 250GB+ cap)<br /><br />Power user plan:  Full bandwidth with no limits on data transfers. This plan should cost substantially more.<br /><br />I personally like that the telcos offer high bandwidth downloading even if they dont want customers using this much bandwidth constantly. If you think of their average customer (myself included), they are not going to download 24x7x365. What they are going to do is use the bandwidth in a bursty nature and appreciate the high transfer rate when they do use it.<br /><br />If the telcos do starting enforcing caps, then i think they should be required to offer an unrestricted plan even if it is really expensive.",

Let&#39;s put P2P users in 2 categories:<br /><br />Casual P2P user needs a 1-2Mbit line to download average Xvid movie in real time, and even if he only watches 1/3 of downloaded movies and does that for 4 hours a day, it means he uses no more than 0.5 to 1 Mbps in average, which is some 10% of an average xDSL and less than 5% of an average FTTH connection.<br /><br />&quot;Collectors&quot;, users that download/upload way more that they can actualy consume (be it to expand their personal software/movie library or simply to gain ranks on torrent community sites) will download as much as possible, but they are limited by their upload bandwidth (because most fast torrent sites force their users to maintain &gt;1 upload/download ratio). They don&#39;t care how fast something is downloaded, they just want fast overall connection. Sell them 2M/1M 8am-12am / 20M/20M 12am-8am package for the same price as normal 10M/2M and they will do most of their traffic when other users idle.<br /><br />PS: With internet present everywhere and new forms of communications emerging faster than billing models, we are going to see more and more all-you-can-eat offers. Just look at cellular network providers - minute prices are going down, while monthly fees are going up, simply because that&#39;s the only way to get their share, when we will do most of all talks via free Wi-fi internet.<br /><br />PPS: How much do you pay for a megabyte of traffic, when you send a SMS? Who&#39;s getting a free lunch here and who&#39;s paying it?",

      "html": "I had to give up the comments after awhile to post something: My father uses some program called Carbonite to back up his data off-site, and suggested I might want to look into the whole thing. I mentioned to him that rumor has it Comcast caps you at about 50GB / month (that they cap at all disturbs me - I&#39;d rather they throttled the bandwidth to something they can support then potentially let me use up my month&#39;s allotmet in a couple of days). I mentioned that to back up a 1TB NAS and a couple of servers would take me about 20 months, barring no other traffic and no changes ... not very feasible. Of course, supposedly they compress the data before it&#39;s uploaded, and I no doubt have junk accumulated (about 15 years worth of data, all accumulated, probably duplicates everywhere). <br />I was present when I made the agreement for cable, and it was not for a usage cap, it was for a minimum bandwidth - what&#39;s the point of their recent bandwidth increase if I can&#39;t take advantage of it? That&#39;s about as useful as saying &#39;You and the other subscribers on your segment now have double the bandwidth to your house with which you can share the same old bottleneck at the distribution layer&#39;. <br />Spare me, and give me something I can use (I pay for unlimited voice / data / text on my phone because I hate surprises). <br />How could you possibly subscribe to NetFlix, download games, patches, or even heavily VPN with such restrictions? I&#39;m not interested in a mansion to time-share for 2 weeks / year, I want a modest house I can live in 24x7.",

      "html": "Okay, now, keeping in mind that 1 mbit/sec costs around 30-40 euros per month all-inclusive. From the customers modem, including (a bit of) tech support, to buying from transit partners ... (and that&#39;s heavily negotiated. A new entrant in the market will pay closer to 80).<br /><br />So allow me to give you prices for your &quot;reasonable plans&quot; :<br /><br />Stretch plan : 50 euros per mbit. We&#39;re talking 100 or 150 euros for a decent connection<br /><br />Your plan : Since full bandwidth requires oversubscription, a reasonable effort guarantee for good connection will require 2-3 mbit provisioning per mbit that you intend to use. 250 Gb is about 1 mbit. Prices tripled this means about 130 euros/month for some 300 Gb.<br /><br />Power user plan : 20 * 40 euros per month = 800 euros per month.<br /><br />There you have it. Now all you need to do is to convince just about the entire nation that these are better options than the oversubscribe-and-dump-the-hogs plan.<br /><br />These prices, btw, are *not* sufficient to guarantee full bandwidth to either the &quot;my plan&quot; or &quot;power user&quot; type users. That requires oversubscription the other way, and therefore we&#39;re talking at least another 20, 30% rise in price per mbit, and it requires that the price of the &quot;my plan&quot; goes up to the power user plan.<br /><br />So mr &quot;let&#39;s just have different plans&quot; I doubt what you&#39;re saying is  a viable business model. Customers would run to the competition faster than muslim women run away from their husbands.<br /><br />@Ivan Peplnjak<br /><br />Thanks for the offer for the &quot;bandwidth sharing&quot; device. We have those actually. We don&#39;t use them except for a few users in a few locations (due to their prices).<br /><br />@Mark Paquette<br /><br />&quot;A modest house&quot; (called a business subscription), is 100% available for us. At prices that can be summarized as &quot;about 50$ per megabit&quot;. <br /><br />You *can* get a relatively cheap 1 or 2 mbit business connection easily enough. From us, and from comcast too if that&#39;s your fancy. But any payable connection will not be capable of backupping 20 tera reliably ... if you want a disk + 20 tera backup for a reasonable price, then you need to look into colocation (put your machines in a central location where you can get 100 mbit for 200-300 euros per month).",
