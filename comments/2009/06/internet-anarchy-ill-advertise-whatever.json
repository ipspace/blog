Until upstream BGP filtering is made more consistent across providers worldwide, this will continue to be a motivator.",

Responding by injecting more granular routes as you mention is a purely *reactionary* measure; damage has already been done by this point. Many organizations, where inaccessibility is measured in millions of dollars per minute,  simply aren&#39;t willing to risk the hours of downtime that a potential attack (accidental or otherwise) could cost.<br /><br />As I said, the only presently available solution for this is to raise confidence in the filtering undertaken by major autonomous systems across the globe; obviously not an easy thing to do.",
