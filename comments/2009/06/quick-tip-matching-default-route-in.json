      "html": "I have never quite understood why cisco IOS allows prefix or route matching using ACLs. This should purely be the function of prefix lists. ACLs should only be used to match IP header fields. In case Cisco decided to keep it to extend legacy support, they should deprecate this capability asap as it only ends up complicating things",

I have been told to reference a default route using an ACL you would type in the following:<br /><br />access-list 100 permit ip any host 0.0.0.0<br /><br />doesn&#39;t this translate into access-list 100 permit ip 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0   ?<br /><br />Is this not correct?",
