  html: Great analogy! So in life is it better to be a do-all-average duck or expert-[fish|cheetah|eagle]...<br
    /><br />Btw, would you consider MPLS/IP a duck?

  html: Nah I would consider MPLS/IP a Platypus. It looks like a couple of different
    animals have been stiched together frankenstien style, but it is really a unique
    beastie.

  html: MPLS/IP is like the mythical beast Pegasus.  IP is the (work)horse, and MPLS
    gives it wings.

  html: I was the guy that did the duck presentation for GDC.  The quote is slightly
    wrong.  The payoff idea was that the duck could do it all even if not the best
    at ONE thing.  I am amazed that anyone remembers the image of RAMBO the duck.
