      "html": "I followed the conversation on NANOG with much pleasure, from both the pro- and the con-side of the argument, regardless of RFC-&#39;legality&#39;. <br /><br />If I recall correctly the argument started because of loadbalancing/high availability issues.<br /><br />It gets even more interesting if you allow the host to bridge between these interfaces and an HA virtual interface, although I think that bundeling (bonding) of the interfaces the &#39;cleanest&#39; solution is. Ofcourse there are some problems if your aggeregate is spanned over multiple switches because of HA demands, which often forces the use of active/passive constructions.<br /><br />Luckily switch-cluster technology (SMLT, VSS etc.) is becoming available on enterprise-grade hardware, which overcomes these problems. <br /><br />Question regarding the future, will there be host-implementations of L2MP? Oppertunity or headache?",

      "html": "There were several comments in the NANOG thread suggesting that exit interface and source IP address are necessarily correlated.<br /><br />This just isn&#39;t true.<br /><br />For connectionless protocols, and for the first (SYN) packet in a TCP session, the correlation *might* be there, but even that can be changed.<br /><br />Consider the &quot;source-interface&quot; set of IOS commands, which force the first packet in a session to ignore the exit interface.<br /><br />For a mid-session example, consider this:   I can ssh into the external interface of my linksys router from inside my home network.<br /><br />The exit interface of the response packet is the internal one, but the source address is the external one.<br /><br />I&#39;m suprised how many people got this wrong.",
