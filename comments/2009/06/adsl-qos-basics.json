      "html": "The biggest problem with ADSL QoS is basically that the uplink direction is where the congestion happens most of the times. Downstream rates are usually high enough to move the primary downstream congestion point to the oversubscribed provider network or the Internet.<br /><br />As for the upstream direction, we usually have a really painful mix: IP over PPP over Ethernet over ATM (AAL5SNAP). Here is the worst thing : even if you prioritize voice packets, you still can&#39;t do *interleaving* and thus large packets may block small voice packets (since most uplink rates are below 1Mbps). <br /><br />As we know, originally ATM was designed to used fixed size cells and make QoS nice and easy. But once you start using AALs you face numerous limitations: e.g. AAL5 does not allow you to reorder cells. Thus, ATM fragmentation is useless with respect to VoIP quality when using AAL5. <br /><br />Cisco&#39;s answer to that problem was using multilink PPP fragmenation and interleaving over ATM. (Man, isn&#39;t that crazy already?!). However, while this works for PPPoA it does not work for PPPoEoA. You may try it however much you want, but PPPoE just does not appear to be working righ with fragmentation. Too bad they didn&#39;t think of it ;)<br /><br />Thus, the only way to avoid high serializatio delays for voice, is by either making sure there are no high-bandwidth uploads (e.g. no P2P apps) OR by setting IP MTU in CPE router to a value matching the acceptable serialization delay. You may also use TCP adjust MSS for this task. This may lead to excessive IP fragmentation and TCP overheads, but still looks like the only viable solution.",

I do not think that Cisco has a WAN interface for it at this time, but it would be interesting, because if the modem was integrated in the Cisco, the WAN interface would know the actual bandwidth, and one could possibly apply fancy queueing.<br /><br />Shaping requires that one knows the actual bandwidth. On the downlink, and possibly even on the uplink, this might change occasionally due to the DSL Rate Adaptive Mode.",
