  html: PowerPoint with an old template from Cisco. Takes a while to draw, but the
    results are OK.<br /><br />A few years ago someone decided that the devices should
    be darker green/grayish-blue and I really like those icons. Then they unfortunately
    reverted back to the light blue (the DSLAM in the diagram is the &quot;new&quot;
    icon) ... but I guess this is a question of personal taste.

  html: Remember to include double VLAN tagging (QinQ) in the third scenario, between
    DSLAM and NAS. It adds a lot of &quot;interesting&quot; questions. How do QoS
    mechanisms consider both tags? Headers or payload? And what about the MTU?

  html: Great overview!<br />What other options for L2 are there other than ATM, as
    im sure not all ISP&#39;s will continue supporting an ATM network. In your overview,
    the link im talking about is the DSL access.<br /><br />Again, thanks!

  html: As far as I understand, DSL access always uses ATM cells, but this does not
    impact the rest of the ISP network if the DSLAM has (Fast/Gig)Ethernet uplink.

  html: 2 &amp; 3 can be merged into one device.<br />The CPE can terminate the DSL
    line directly.<br /><br />The other change that could exist is that there is no
    PPPoE and the CPE gets assigned an address via DHCP or static config. In a DSL
    network I built in my last job our DSLAM was also the IP gateway for the CPE and
    acted as a router

  html: Hello Thank you for fruitfull blog entries,<br />Would you please let me know
    more about QinQ (Double Tagging) ?<br /><br />I have experienced with that in
    Zhone DSLAM and Mikrotik RouterOS.<br /><br />But thirsty to know more about that!<br
    />Sincerely,<br />Momo.<br /><br />Zohouri@in.com

  html: '@Colin: can you tell me more about your setup? <br /><br />I&#39;ve seen
    DSL modems that also act as PPPoE clients and provide LAN services (DHCP/NAT).
    Likewise, DSLAM could include the PPPoE server/IP routing functionality and terminate
    PPPoE IP traffic, or it could use a different (simpler) protocol stack ... and
    I need to know about that :)'

    (which still are layer 2).

  html: '@ Ivan<br />There are several IP-DSLAM&#39;s who are able to act as an IP
    edge device and terminate PPP sessions directly, Huawei&#39;s SmartAX MA5600 can
    do it as far as I know (is someone really using Huawei devices? ;-) ) and I&#39;m
    pretty sure that other vendors have simmilar solutions. So you&#39;ve mostly bare
    Ethernet and no ATM here...<br /><br />Yet another scenario would be a network
    which is on the way to an NGN - you might have legacy ATM-based services &amp;
    devices (Voice over ATM, ATM-based DSL-lines, ...) and newer IP/MPLS-based services
    &amp; devices.<br />I know providers which use MPLS- or L2TPv3-tunneling to transport
    the legacy ATM traffic over their IP core to an ATM switch / LAC - not a good
    thing for troubleshooting...<br /><br />Regards<br />Christoph'

  html: DSL is available with &quot;native&quot; ethernet via EFM. All VDSL2 is native
    ethernet as far as I know. I estimate that most DSL deployments today would use
    ethernet backhauled, IP-aware hardware these days.<br /><br />Implementations
    and Applications of DSL Technology  by Golden et al. explains S and C vlan tagging
    options concisely. But basically, you can have multiple VLAN&#39;s stacked just
    like with atm PVI/VCI. You can have 1:1 or N:1 configurations. It also expands
    the maximum amount of VLAN&#39;s by providing two 12-bit address segments, for
    4096*4096 vlans.

  html: I thought that in newer &#39;IP&#39; DSLAMs, such as ALU ISAMs, that you terminate
    the session on the DSLAM itself. I don&#39;t think that this is a good idea for
    IPVPN as you&#39;d then need to run MP-BGP and MPLS on the DSLAM as well. It&#39;d
    be OK for consumer-grade internet access. Not very good for LI.

    forward the VPN sessions to dedicated LNS systems unsing L2TP...'
