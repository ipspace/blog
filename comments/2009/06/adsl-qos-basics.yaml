    switches, ...)<br /><br />IMS

  html: '&quot;you have to shape traffic on the Dialer Interface, not the outside
    Ethernet Interface&quot;<br /><br />This seems to conflict with this doco which
    I have been using and appears to work fine :<br /><br />http://tinyurl.com/msrbly<br
    /><br />When I try to applie a service policy to the Dialer interface I get an
    error along the lines of &quot;GTS not supported on this interface&quot;<br /><br
    />Can you shine some light on this Ivan?'

  html: or you can put &quot;ppp multilink&quot; on the dialer,<br />apply the service
    policy to the dialer<br />and see it (at least apparently) doing<br />stuff on
    virtual-access 4 in my case.

  html: 'The biggest problem with ADSL QoS is basically that the uplink direction
    is where the congestion happens most of the times. Downstream rates are usually
    high enough to move the primary downstream congestion point to the oversubscribed
    provider network or the Internet.<br /><br />As for the upstream direction, we
    usually have a really painful mix: IP over PPP over Ethernet over ATM (AAL5SNAP).
    Here is the worst thing : even if you prioritize voice packets, you still can&#39;t
    do *interleaving* and thus large packets may block small voice packets (since
    most uplink rates are below 1Mbps). <br /><br />As we know, originally ATM was
    designed to used fixed size cells and make QoS nice and easy. But once you start
    using AALs you face numerous limitations: e.g. AAL5 does not allow you to reorder
    cells. Thus, ATM fragmentation is useless with respect to VoIP quality when using
    AAL5. <br /><br />Cisco&#39;s answer to that problem was using multilink PPP fragmenation
    and interleaving over ATM. (Man, isn&#39;t that crazy already?!). However, while
    this works for PPPoA it does not work for PPPoEoA. You may try it however much
    you want, but PPPoE just does not appear to be working righ with fragmentation.
    Too bad they didn&#39;t think of it ;)<br /><br />Thus, the only way to avoid
    high serializatio delays for voice, is by either making sure there are no high-bandwidth
    uploads (e.g. no P2P apps) OR by setting IP MTU in CPE router to a value matching
    the acceptable serialization delay. You may also use TCP adjust MSS for this task.
    This may lead to excessive IP fragmentation and TCP overheads, but still looks
    like the only viable solution.'

  html: I don&#39;t really undesrtand because IOS lets me put the service policy output
    on the dialer and the atm interface. But if i do si int atm 0 i see that 255/255
    rx or tx is just on the physical int not the logical. So the question is <br />where
    should I apply the service-policy output?<br /><br />kind regards, your podcast
    is great!

  html: correct me if I&#39;m wrong http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk543/tk545/technologies_tech_note09186a00800b2d29.shtml<br
    /><br />so if i apply qos on Dialer it will work per-session basis, so is the
    same using just one dialer, if I have two it will be two queues from two dialers,
    am I wright? so or I have just one dialer or I apply it to the physical interface.
    <br />And the bandwidt commands I guess to the phycial too isn&#39;t it?<br /><br
    />Kind regards

  html: IOS allows you to apply service policy on any interface ... it just might
    not work. You&#39;ll find hints as to where you need to apply the service policy
    in the Cisco&#39;s document you&#39;ve quoted and in the other comments.

    html: The comment from Anonymous refers to PPPoA. Does it apply to PPPoEoA as
      well?<br /><br />Some ISPs using MSANs are rolling out PPPoE access without
      ATM now. I do not think that Cisco has a WAN interface for it at this time,
      but it would be interesting, because if the modem was integrated in the Cisco,
      the WAN interface would know the actual bandwidth, and one could possibly apply
      fancy queueing.<br /><br />Shaping requires that one knows the actual bandwidth.
      On the downlink, and possibly even on the uplink, this might change occasionally
      due to the DSL Rate Adaptive Mode.

  html: What if I use an ADSL or VDSL WAN interface in the Cisco, does that put the
    congestion point in the Cisco? Can QoS be achieved without the traffic shaping
    on the PPPoE session then?
