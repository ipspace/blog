  html: None of these things is new, they&#39;ve all been taking place for quite some
    time, as you indicate.  The problem is that a lot of mobile networks are designed
    like poorly-designed enterprise networks; that a lot of mobile network operators
    don&#39;t implement even minimal BCPs to protect their infrastructure and/or their
    customers; that on the RF side, there&#39;s little or nothing in terms of policy
    enforcement functionality and/or instrumentation; and that a lot of the mobile-specific
    gear has weak IP stacks, poor instrumentation, and little or nothing in the way
    of policy enforcement and/or other self-protection mechanisms.
