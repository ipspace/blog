    between<br />&quot;aaa authorization commands 1 default group TACACS-AAA-GROUP
    none&quot; and <br />&quot;aaa authorization commands 1 default group TACACS-AAA-GROUP

  html: Hi Ivan/all<br /><br />I&#39;ve tried the example above using the following
    commands<br />R1<br />&quot;aaa authorization commands 1 default local&quot;.<br
    />Now when I telneted from R2 to R1 which has the aaa commands and issue a privilege
    level 1 commands like &quot;show clns, show aliases, show clock&quot; it does
    not permit me to do so, instead it says<br />&quot;% Authorization failed.&quot;<br
    /><br />Do you think that it is the other way around? Instead of (always succeeds),
    it always fails!? Since local database like router has no way to authorize each
    individual commands (like tacacs+ do) or are there any?
