I guess it might be max(rx,tx), but that&#39;s just a guess - never used it with EIGRP, as it&#39;s totally useless.<br /><br />Here&#39;s what you can do: build a lab, start a unidirectional flood, trigger some EIGRP updates &amp; examine EIGRP topology table to see what changes and where it changes.",

      "html": "You said:<br />&quot;Sending EIGRP updates whenever there\u2019s a significant change in load or reliability would be technically feasible, but would diminish the benefits of replacing distance vector behavior with DUAL.&quot;<br /><br />Actually, EIGRP is in essence an enhanced distance vector routing protocol. The fact that it does not send updates at regular intervals does not transform its nature. This merely saves bandwidth and it sends updates when it is only appropriate, that is when changes (interface up/down event, IP addressing change or configured bandwidth/delay change) are detected.<br /><br />So I don&#39;t see any reason why &quot;Sending EIGRP updates whenever there\u2019s a significant change in load or reliability ... would diminish the benefits of replacing distance vector behavior with DUAL.&quot;<br /><br />Actually, I feel this would be a great enhancement to this routing protocol, since this simple ability to detect loaded or unreliable networks would be very valuable to medium-sized networks.<br />It would be the responsability of the network engineer to correctly tweak the values to avoid too many route flaps.",
