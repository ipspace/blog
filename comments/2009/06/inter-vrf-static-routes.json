      "html": "thanks for sharing this with everyone..<br /><br />in summary i can say the following - <br /><br />Routing between two VRFs on the same router is not allowed officially (though method exists to bypass this) using any static route combination for Ethernet/SVI/other multipoint interface types. MP-BGP must be used to achieve this. MP-BGP can be used without any neighbors, just redistribute connected routes into MP-BGP and set the route-targets correctly.<br /><br />To bypass this restriction on P2P links :<br />If VPN1 and VPN2 are connected via a point-to-point interface e.g. serial link, static routes can be used to communicate between the VRFs *WITHOUT* using MPBGP. This doesn\u2019t work for multiaccess interfaces like VLAN or Ethernet interface. <br /><br />ip route vrf VRF1 destination-other-VRF2-subnet mask other-VRF2-local-interface-P2P<br /><br />If added on a interfaces like Ethernet or SVI \u2013 error<br />% For VPN routes, must specify a next hop IP address if not a point-to-point interface<br /><br />cheers<br />Swapnendu<br />CCIE#19804  :)<br /><br />finally the comments worked!",
