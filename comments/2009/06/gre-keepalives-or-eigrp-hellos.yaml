  html: I&#39;ve also heard that (for setups using &quot;tunnel protection&quot;)
    Cisco is working on speeding up their implementation of DPD to the point where
    it can reasonably replace GRE keepalives as a path loss detection method.  Still
    wouldn&#39;t work for me; I need bi-directional and simultaneous detection, and
    the new work doesn&#39;t help with that in a DMVPN context, so I&#39;ll just keep
    begging for BFD across tunnels...
