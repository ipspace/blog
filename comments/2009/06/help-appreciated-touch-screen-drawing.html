            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;ve found the AIPTEC pen tablet to work well.  It&#39;s not going to give you the ability to actually write on the screen but its inexpensive, doesnt need drivers and responds well. http://www.aiptek.com/  Look for model WCK-C121.<br /><br />HTH<br /><br />Brandon</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan,<br /><br />You should look at the Wacom Cintiq.  We have used them to mark up PowerPoints when delivering remote classes(or when a whiteboard isn&#39;t available).   It is basically a VGA monitor that has a wacom tablet overlayed.  It connects to your laptop as a second monitor and requies one USB port for the data.  It is a pretty nice setup but not too portable, there is a control box that isn&#39;t shown in the marketing pictures that is about the size of a 3.5 hd.<br /><br />--Ed</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan<br /><br />I tried  a pen tablet for a while, bit it didn&#39;t work out for me. I use OmniGraffle on a MAC these days and very happy with that. Much faster at drawing than Visio.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I also used a pen table to try for drawing, but I could not get use to it. With much effort and time consuming I could draw something that looked like a topology. For me the biggest issue in using it was that I had to keep my eye on the monitor and to draw on the table without looking at it. Awful.<br />Maybe with somekind of touch screen quite large screen it will be different. So, I don&#39;t advise you to buy a tablet, or not until you try one :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;m a little late, but if you can get one inexpensively on the used market or find a model you like to replace your current notebook, a tablet PC is a great tool for educators and students alike. My principal background is in chemistry where drawing various diagram, atomic, molecular or even of lab setup/processes is needed and I don&#39;t regret for a second investing in a tablet. My department acutally has a small fleet of them on loan from the University IT department to convince teaching staff that they are a great tool to replace the whiteboard/smartboard because you can draw directly on the slides and capture the lecture as well for re-play.<br /><br />In particular, I like the lenovo X61t and the Toshiba Portege tablets.</div>
