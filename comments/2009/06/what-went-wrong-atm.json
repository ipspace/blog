LANE was ugly but there was no need for it in an end-to-end ATM world.<br />I believe that ATM came too early with very large costs that could be handled by TELCOs only, and not by the average ISP, home user, small corporates.<br />So, we are now doing some kind of workarounds using MPLS, per-hop QoS, trying to figure out how each platform implements QoS etc.",
