So you&#39;ve mostly bare Ethernet and no ATM here...<br /><br />Yet another scenario would be a network which is on the way to an NGN - you might have legacy ATM-based services &amp; devices (Voice over ATM, ATM-based DSL-lines, ...) and newer IP/MPLS-based services &amp; devices.<br />I know providers which use MPLS- or L2TPv3-tunneling to transport the legacy ATM traffic over their IP core to an ATM switch / LAC - not a good thing for troubleshooting...<br /><br />Regards<br />Christoph",

But basically, you can have multiple VLAN&#39;s stacked just like with atm PVI/VCI. You can have 1:1 or N:1 configurations. It also expands the maximum amount of VLAN&#39;s by providing two 12-bit address segments, for 4096*4096 vlans.",
