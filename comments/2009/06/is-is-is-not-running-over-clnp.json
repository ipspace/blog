It should be 0x83 (like in the picture), not 0x82 (which is the same as ES-IS).<br /><br />Off-topic: I am not able to post comments from Firefox (3.0.11). I choose to comment as Name/URL, but the comment doesn&#39;t show up after pressing the Post Comment button.<br /><br />It works from Google&#39;s Chrome. I haven&#39;t tried from IE.",

Should it be &quot;0xFE&quot; only instead?<br />2. How do you capture the ES-IS packets? I means how do we setup an ES in a lab environment.<br />3. Where is CLNS resides in the diagram?<br /><br />Appreciate that you can share out the pcap too. Thanks and have a nice day... :-)",
