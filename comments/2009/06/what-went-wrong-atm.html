            <div class="comment-content">I remember how much troubles I had trying to understand ATM back in 1993 - I was 14 years old then and that stuff kind of blew my mind away ;) <br /><br />ATM to the desktop topic was circulatiing all around 90s - I wonder if anyone was imaging then this emerging into MPLS and killing ATM itself.<br /><br />And do we hear anything about MPLS to the desktop nowadays? :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">There is no need for MPLS to the desktop. MPLS is a core technology (effectively adding virtual circuits to IP infrastructure) and there&#39;s nothing to gain (and scalability to lose) by extending it further.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I think you have missed the major issue, which is the cost. LANE was ugly but there was no need for it in an end-to-end ATM world.<br />I believe that ATM came too early with very large costs that could be handled by TELCOs only, and not by the average ISP, home user, small corporates.<br />So, we are now doing some kind of workarounds using MPLS, per-hop QoS, trying to figure out how each platform implements QoS etc.</div>
