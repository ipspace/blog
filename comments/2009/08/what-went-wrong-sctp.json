         "html": "Greeting! Well I am new to protocols and all network stuff but I really like them and want to learn as many things as I can. My opinion is that SCTP must mature before they use it as best option. It is really a promising protocol. 4G networks fully support it. So I think it is like IPv4 and IPv6. There is no need to use only IPv6 when you can use IPv4 with an IPv6 prefix. It will get years to upgrade all world&#39;s servers, routers and applications IP versions from 4 to 6, they just let it be, and it is not efficient or profitable at all to change that. So that&#39;s the way they move around SCTP too. They will not change a thing allready in use, optimized by TCP let&#39;s say in today&#39;s standards, but they will emerge new things into old ones using this awesome protocol!",
