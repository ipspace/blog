  html: Not only Vines have separate access-list numbering space. X.29 access-list
    has range from 1 to 199. It was designed this way because access-group &lt;number&gt;
    can be used only once in line configuration. If you would like to limit access
    to the router CLI from IP 192.168.1.0/24 and from X.121 026012213... then you
    must create both access-lists with the same number.
