We tracked it down to a couple &quot;clustered&quot; hosts running Microsoft NLB. We eventually moved them onto a DNS-based load balancing solution off our GSLB which met their needs.<br /><br />If you read the protocol design on Microsoft Technet, it is truly written by application developers. However, if you absolutely MUST run NLB in your network, definitely go with the multicast option with IGMP snooping to handle any flooding issues.

The alternative is to use multicast mode - which sounds just peachy, but on a single LAN segment there are no membership requests to snoop so the data  floods out every port just like in the unicast model.<br /><br />Last time I came across this a few years back, my solution was the same as Dragan&#39;s - isolation by segmentation. *sigh*",
