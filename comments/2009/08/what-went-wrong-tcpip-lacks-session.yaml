  html: LISP will solve this...if it is adopted.  It looks awesome and seems to be
    well thought out.  I just heard one of the authors of it speak and I was impressed.

  html: LISP will _NOT_ solve this particular problem. LISP tries to save the IP core
    from exploding. It addresses the consequences, not the root cause of the problem.

  html: Only used in telecom networks to connect servers that speak SS7 to each other.
    Sorry for being general SCTP is a transport for SS7 over IP instead of the legacy
    SS7 over TDM.<br /><br />That&#39;s the only place I&#39;ve seen it used.

  html: Oh, forgot to post the link to the SCTP post:<br /><br />http://blog.ioshints.info/2009/08/what-went-wrong-sctp.html<br
    /><br />SCTP is commonly used in scenarios where it&#39;s important to have communication
    between more than a pair of IP addresses (multihoming scenarios) and where the
    path loss detection is critical. I know it&#39;s used between PIX/ASA firewalls,
    supposedly it&#39;s also used between media gateways.

  html: Actually I think LISP when it&#39;s implemented in the host stack could help
    &quot;solve&quot;[1] this problem. When the host is the xTR, like some in some
    of the mobile node examples, LISP ends up looking a lot like SHIM6 to me. The
    EIDs end up being session endpoint identifiers and since the EIDs themselves are
    IP addresses the applications can still use the Socket API. The nice thing about
    this is that there is a path of increment deployment - LISP could end up being
    implemented in network devices first and then migrate to being implemented in
    the hosts.<br /><br />(While using another slice of IP addresses to represent
    sessions endpoints does seem messy, I think this namespace does need to be enumerated
    out of something. I wonder what the proposal for this is in the Recursive Inter-Network
    Architcture (RINA)?).<br /><br />[1] Of course I&#39;m using the term solve very
    loosely. Anyone that&#39;s been tracking LISP knows there are a lot of unanswered
    questions ;)

    html: I probably misunderstood something, but it seems to me you still need to
      reach the IP address listed in the A/AAAA record to establish the first TCP
      session (and the client still passes only a single address in the connect call),
      so MP-TCP solves the multipathing and transport session recovery, but not the
      multihoming issues.

  html: Multipath TCP is the session layer that you are discussing in this post
