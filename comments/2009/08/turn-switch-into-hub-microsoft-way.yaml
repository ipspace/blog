  html: Ivan,<br /><br />I ran into this recently with folks complaining about poor
    voice quality. As it turns out, the CPUs on our 6500s were getting pegged. We
    tracked it down to a couple &quot;clustered&quot; hosts running Microsoft NLB.
    We eventually moved them onto a DNS-based load balancing solution off our GSLB
    which met their needs.<br /><br />If you read the protocol design on Microsoft
    Technet, it is truly written by application developers. However, if you absolutely
    MUST run NLB in your network, definitely go with the multicast option with IGMP
    snooping to handle any flooding issues. Details here:<br /><br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps708/products_configuration_example09186a0080a07203.shtml<br

  html: We also have ran into issues with the &quot;Microsoft&quot; solution. Not
    only do the switches suffer from high CPU but every host on the switch takes a
    CPU hit. We also had to dumb down our IPS because it sees this behavior as an
    attack.

  html: As Steve Shaw indicates, it&#39;s worth reading the Microsoft NLB documentation
    just so you can shake your head in wonder at the awesome logic of it:<br /><br
    />http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc782694%28WS.10%29.aspx<br /><br
    />In unicast mode, the same MAC address is used for ALL cluster members (who are
    now of course unable to communicate with one another). The alternative is to use
    multicast mode - which sounds just peachy, but on a single LAN segment there are
    no membership requests to snoop so the data  floods out every port just like in
    the unicast model.<br /><br />Last time I came across this a few years back, my
    solution was the same as Dragan&#39;s - isolation by segmentation. *sigh*
