The DNS API doesn&#39;t provide a way to resolve names asynchronously (you can use threads with &quot;_r&quot; functions, but the programs become quickly a big mess). Also a big mess when you want to do low-levels things like setting the TTL or other funny things, which are often not portable.",

      "html": "Ivan,<br /><br />I cannot speak for windows or linux systems, but in FreeBSD (and other BSD systems) getadddrinfo does the job properly.<br /><br />Of course, since a name can have several IP addresses, you need to loop it till you get a connection. You can even use wildcards as parameters to getaddrinfo so you&#39;ll be able to try all address on all family address available for that name. It&#39;s up to the programmer to do it properly.<br /><br />From &quot;man getaddrinfo&quot; (FreeBSD 7.1):<br /><br />     The following code tries to connect to ``www.kame.net&#39;&#39; service ``http&#39;&#39;<br />     via a stream socket.  It loops through all the addresses available,<br />     regardless of address family.  If the destination resolves to an IPv4<br />     address, it will use an AF_INET socket.  Similarly, if it resolves to<br />     IPv6, an AF_INET6 socket is used.  Observe that there is no hardcoded<br />     reference to a particular address family.  The code works even if<br />     getaddrinfo() returns addresses that are not IPv4/v6.<br /><br />           struct addrinfo hints, *res, *res0;<br />           int error;<br />           int s;<br />           const char *cause = NULL;<br /><br />           memset(&amp;hints, 0, sizeof(hints));<br />           hints.ai_family = PF_UNSPEC;<br />           hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;<br />           error = getaddrinfo(&quot;www.kame.net&quot;, &quot;http&quot;, &amp;hints, &amp;res0);<br />           if (error) {<br />                   errx(1, &quot;%s&quot;, gai_strerror(error));<br />                   /*NOTREACHED*/<br />           }<br />           s = -1;<br />           for (res = res0; res; res = res-&gt;ai_next) {<br />                   s = socket(res-&gt;ai_family, res-&gt;ai_socktype,<br />                       res-&gt;ai_protocol);<br />                   if (s &lt; 0) {<br />                           cause = &quot;socket&quot;;<br />                           continue;<br />                   }<br /><br />                   if (connect(s, res-&gt;ai_addr, res-&gt;ai_addrlen) &lt; 0) {<br />                           cause = &quot;connect&quot;;<br />                           close(s);<br />                           s = -1;<br />                           continue;<br />                   }<br /><br />                   break;  /* okay we got one */<br />           }<br />           if (s &lt; 0) {<br />                   err(1, &quot;%s&quot;, cause);<br />                   /*NOTREACHED*/<br />           }<br />           freeaddrinfo(res0);<br /><br />They are still using the BSD API, but didn&#39;t update their version, though.",
