I know it&#39;s used between PIX/ASA firewalls, supposedly it&#39;s also used between media gateways.",

      "html": "Actually I think LISP when it&#39;s implemented in the host stack could help &quot;solve&quot;[1] this problem. When the host is the xTR, like some in some of the mobile node examples, LISP ends up looking a lot like SHIM6 to me. The EIDs end up being session endpoint identifiers and since the EIDs themselves are IP addresses the applications can still use the Socket API. The nice thing about this is that there is a path of increment deployment - LISP could end up being implemented in network devices first and then migrate to being implemented in the hosts.<br /><br />(While using another slice of IP addresses to represent sessions endpoints does seem messy, I think this namespace does need to be enumerated out of something. I wonder what the proposal for this is in the Recursive Inter-Network Architcture (RINA)?).<br /><br />[1] Of course I&#39;m using the term solve very loosely. Anyone that&#39;s been tracking LISP knows there are a lot of unanswered questions ;)",
