  html: Another solution is to run a brand new OSPF/ISIS process and redistribute
    it into the legacy IGP. The customers won&#39;t see the  change (except a brief
    connection loss) and you will be able to filter the updates in order to protect
    the &quot;inner&quot; network.

  html: Many of the small ISP networks I&#39;ve seen are either running an IGP with
    customers, or redistributing customer static routes into their IGP (instead of
    BGP). Then they redistribute the IGP into BGP (usually with no filters) and hope
    for the best. I&#39;ve had numerous conversations trying to explain the nightmare
    waiting to happen, but as far as I know none of them has ever changed the practice.

  html: Considering the amount of duct tape used to patch together the Internet in
    various odd places, it&#39;s a wonder we don&#39;t get more BGP-related incidents.<br
    /><br />But, as you&#39;ve said, some people try really hard not to learn.

  html: This is absolutely better than the &quot;original&quot; idea, but still has
    a few drawbacks. Unless you deploy OSPF process per customer, other customers
    in the same OSPF process could be impacted (things could get a bit better if you
    run each customer in a separate area).<br /><br />Additionally, you have to use
    &quot;distribute-list in&quot; in customer OSPF processes on edge routers to prevent
    invalid OSPF routes from entering the IP routing table.

  html: Best option (ISIS) is of course to flood all LSPs with all bits set in sequence
    number and invalid information so that you are closest in terms of metric to everyone,
    you&#39;d break entire network.<br />Reloading boxes wouldn&#39;t help a bit,
    as if some box is up, it&#39;ll reflood the broken data.<br /><br />Few ways to
    recover<br />1) reload all boxes at same time<br />2) wait for LSP to time out,
    many networks have LSP lifetime maxed to 18h<br />3) change net address of each
    box

  html: My own horror story. At one point we had OSPF happily in the core and were
    asked (for the 1st time) to deliver an active/active dual link to a customer site
    in quick order. We took the easy way out and simply extended the core ospf out
    to the CPE. Unfortunately the method stuck for a limited number of such connections
    before a more robust solution was used. Wind forward 2 years and we start seeing
    horrendous churn in the core OSPF. No route shows up as being stable for more
    than 30 mins. After a considerable amount of debugging mostly in the small hours
    when other changes were minimal we identified that all OSPF routes were being
    flushed milliseconds before they should have be refreshed. The flush instantly
    triggered a refresh but every route was disappearing for a few seconds every 30
    mins.<br /><br />The flush was coming from one of the CPEs deployed above...who&#39;s
    clock was running almost exactly twice as fast as normal. So it was seeing the
    routes hit the 60min (no refresh) and flush. A few cyles slower and we&#39;d probably
    never have had a problem. It took me several minutes staring at the errant CPE
    cli (a 1720 I recall!) when I found it with scripted &quot;sh clock&quot; checking
    the router time over a fixed period. Disabled OSPF on that CPE and......the whole
    network returned to graceful stability.
