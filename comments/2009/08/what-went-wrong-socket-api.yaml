  html: I agree this API is totally brain-dead. It is essentially synchronous (well,
    you can use non-blocking sockets for connect/send/rcv/...) whereas it should be
    event-driven. The DNS API doesn&#39;t provide a way to resolve names asynchronously
    (you can use threads with &quot;_r&quot; functions, but the programs become quickly
    a big mess). Also a big mess when you want to do low-levels things like setting
    the TTL or other funny things, which are often not portable.

    a trusted source for programmers. If you really programm without reading the manual
    ... please do not blog about.

  html: 'Dear Guest!<br /><br />First of all, I love good discussion ... but prefer
    to have it with people who have at least a unique (even if fictitious) identity,
    so I would appreciate if you could use a unique identifier for comments that might
    evolve into an (hopefully interesting) discussion.<br /><br />Now for the getaddrinfo:
    I don&#39;t understand what you mean with the &quot;correct loop&quot;. While
    the getaddrinfo is supposed to provide more than one address,it looks like that&#39;s
    not always the case. What were you trying to say?'

  html: SCTP looks good (at least from the distance), but is unfortunately totally
    useless (also because of broken Socket API :).

  html: Please note that this is NOT a programming blog. I am not trying to teach
    anyone how to program client-server architectures in C (or any other programming
    language); there are millions of people better qualified to do that.<br /><br
    />What I&#39;m saying is that the Socket API is conceptually broken and that the
    handling of L3 addresses that the applications are forced to do severely hinders
    our ability to address problems we&#39;re having with the exploding Internet.<br
    /><br />My reference to the Wikipedia is not meant to give a programmer a pointer
    to a reference documentation (which, BTW, differs between operating systems),
    but to give some background information to those that are not familiar with the
    structure of the Socket API (not everyone has been blessed with exposure to C++
    programming), so that they could better understand my arguments.<br /><br />If
    someone is trying to learn programming reading my blog posts, he&#39;s found a
    wrong source.

  html: There&#39;s always something more to be said :) Last but not least, the Wikipedia
    article about Berkeley sockets does provide all the relevant references and external
    links at the end of the article, so those that need a trusted official source
    can find them ;)

  html: Ivan,<br /><br />I cannot speak for windows or linux systems, but in FreeBSD
    (and other BSD systems) getadddrinfo does the job properly.<br /><br />Of course,
    since a name can have several IP addresses, you need to loop it till you get a
    connection. You can even use wildcards as parameters to getaddrinfo so you&#39;ll
    be able to try all address on all family address available for that name. It&#39;s
    up to the programmer to do it properly.<br /><br />From &quot;man getaddrinfo&quot;
    (FreeBSD 7.1):<br /><br />     The following code tries to connect to ``www.kame.net&#39;&#39;
    service ``http&#39;&#39;<br />     via a stream socket.  It loops through all
    the addresses available,<br />     regardless of address family.  If the destination
    resolves to an IPv4<br />     address, it will use an AF_INET socket.  Similarly,
    if it resolves to<br />     IPv6, an AF_INET6 socket is used.  Observe that there
    is no hardcoded<br />     reference to a particular address family.  The code
    works even if<br />     getaddrinfo() returns addresses that are not IPv4/v6.<br
    /><br />           struct addrinfo hints, *res, *res0;<br />           int error;<br
    />           int s;<br />           const char *cause = NULL;<br /><br />           memset(&amp;hints,
    0, sizeof(hints));<br />           hints.ai_family = PF_UNSPEC;<br />           hints.ai_socktype
    = SOCK_STREAM;<br />           error = getaddrinfo(&quot;www.kame.net&quot;, &quot;http&quot;,
    &amp;hints, &amp;res0);<br />           if (error) {<br />                   errx(1,
    &quot;%s&quot;, gai_strerror(error));<br />                   /*NOTREACHED*/<br
    />           }<br />           s = -1;<br />           for (res = res0; res; res
    = res-&gt;ai_next) {<br />                   s = socket(res-&gt;ai_family, res-&gt;ai_socktype,<br
    />                       res-&gt;ai_protocol);<br />                   if (s &lt;
    0) {<br />                           cause = &quot;socket&quot;;<br />                           continue;<br
    />                   }<br /><br />                   if (connect(s, res-&gt;ai_addr,
    res-&gt;ai_addrlen) &lt; 0) {<br />                           cause = &quot;connect&quot;;<br
    />                           close(s);<br />                           s = -1;<br
    />                           continue;<br />                   }<br /><br />                   break;  /*
    okay we got one */<br />           }<br />           if (s &lt; 0) {<br />                   err(1,
    &quot;%s&quot;, cause);<br />                   /*NOTREACHED*/<br />           }<br
    />           freeaddrinfo(res0);<br /><br />They are still using the BSD API,
    but didn&#39;t update their version, though.

  html: I can&#39;t agree with this - lib C provides you with basic functionaly for
    simple reason more functionality you will put there more bugs you will  create
    and more testig it&#39;s required this will have performance impact as well.Lib
    C is not right place to put this additional functionality <br />have a look to
    other utility libraries there, this is their desing principal.

  html: Do you believe this offers hope?<br /><br />http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket-19<br
    /><br />It would appear that the multihoming issue could get better, assuming
    the one-to-many API gets deployed. I haven&#39;t had a chance to play around with
    it yet, but libsctp appears to be the Linux implementation.<br /><br />&quot;If
    a bind() is not called prior to a sendmsg() call that initiates a<br />   new
    association, the system picks an ephemeral port and will choose<br />   an address
    set equivalent to binding with a wildcard address.  One of<br />   those addresses
    will be the primary address for the association.<br />   This automatically enables
    the multi-homing capability of SCTP.&quot;<br /><br />Also, sctp_getpaddrs looks
    promising, returning all of the addresses of an existing endpoint. Now how that
    works in practice? Not sure...<br /><br />And as usual, thanks for the insights!

  html: This assumes the programmer knows what a network is and how it works. Very
    few among the best of programmers do, and most of those are too lazy to do this
    much work to create a robust application. <br /><br />If we truly want reliable
    network applications, the API for opening a socket should be something along the
    lines of:<br /><br />Stream myStream;<br /><br />try {<br />    myStream = Network.Connect(&quot;somehost.foobar.com&quot;,
    &quot;http&quot;);<br />} catch (NetworkException) {<br />    // Oops, it didn&#39;t
    work. Deal with it somehow.<br />}<br /><br />DoSomething(myStream);<br /><br
    />Anything more complicated will result in a handful of well-behaved applications
    and a vast multitude of crap.

  html: 'I agree that the sockets API doesn&#39;t facilitate building distributed
    applications at all. A decent API would be oriented towards Inter Process Communication
    (IPC), and provide primitives to allocate flows between applications by name,
    allowing a certain QoS specification (for example: allocate me a flow to application
    B, and data should be delivered in order, reliably, maximum this delay). How to
    honour this request is the business of the &quot;networking stack&quot;, not the
    application.<br /><br />I think that one of the main issues is that the current
    networking &quot;protocol suite&quot; is oriented towards moving data between
    interfaces of computers, instead of allowing applications to communicate (the
    issue is not just the sockets interface...)'

  html: "Ivan, This is a old post. But I would like point out that the following statement\
    \ is patently false..<br /><br />&quot;However, most of the applications will\
    \ perform the gethostbyname() call which returns one of the addresses (regardless\
    \ of whether it\u2019s reachable or not) that is then passed to the connect()\

    \ multiple IP addresses if the DNS reply has multiple A records. The main reason\
    \ gethostbyname() was deprecated in favor of getaddrinfo() is because of the lack\
    \ of IPv6 support in the former and not because the former could return only one\
    \ IP address. The link you gave to explain the issue with getaddrinfo() is invalid\
    \ now. If there is an alternate link please share it."
