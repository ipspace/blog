As a Senior Architect for a mid-cap bank ($13B), we are actively involved in the early stages of a large VoIP rollout. Wrong decision? I highly think not. <BR/><BR/>The decision to go VoIP, like very other technology, must be based on sound business &amp; architectural principles, not just trade-mag fad ideology. It must be a fit for your specific business, it must pass the grade on the ROI modeling, the run rate calculations and most importantly, you need to have an excellent grasp of your current architecture. <BR/><BR/>We have spent years designing and implementing our infrastructure to support all aspects of VoIP and for our model, VoIP makes perfect sense. Making sense on the financial, technological, &amp; even ideological model is important to please all aspects of the expense &amp; effort to go VoIP.<BR/><BR/>VoIP technology and its advantages will continue to deliver, but looks like with the current economy in question, it more than ever will require excellent engineering prowess &amp; extremely sound business case practices. <BR/><BR/>Cheers,<BR/>Andy",
