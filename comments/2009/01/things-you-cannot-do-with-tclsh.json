Unfortunately it requires EEM version 3.0 and the ASR has EEM version 2.3.  The sort is rather rudimentary - throws away lines with too few columns and lines that contain a non-integer value in the specified column, but again it&#39;s just a proof of concept.  <br /><br />http://forums.cisco.com/eforum/servlet/EEM?page=eem&amp;fn=script&amp;scriptId=2427",
