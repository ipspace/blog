Assuming the CEs are running HSRP so all traffic which is arriving at HSRP active router will just be send to the eBPG neighbor of this HSRP-active router. The other CE-uplink will not be utilized.<br /><br />The only idea i had to make Ad of eBGP and iBGP equal on the CE-routers, but this is not really a good idea , is it ?<br /><br />h",
