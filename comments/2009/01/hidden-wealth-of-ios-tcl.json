This should be simple but I can&#39;t find any posts about it.",

BTW, this is how you solve the AAA problem:<br /><br />http://blog.ioshints.info/2007/05/command-authorization-fails-with-eem.html<br /><br />There was also a bug where AAA authorization would fail under weird circumstances. I know a bug report was filed, I&#39;m not sure whether it was fixed or when.",

I&#39;ve revisited and determined that I needed both the cli username and the action &quot;enable&quot; to work (I didn&#39;t have that originally).  Thank you very much for prompting the fresh look!  <br /><br />There was a bug with 12.4(22)T where TCL would only send a null username to AAA.  That was fixed in 12.4(22)T2.<br /><br />Here&#39;s my script and EEM config if it is helpful to anyone else.

      "html": "One reason these packages are not available from Tclsh is because they are in the tmpsys file system which is controlled, managed and owned by the EEM development team at Cisco.  The Tcl development team can&#39;t rely on the packages and libraries always being there since they don&#39;t own them.  So they are not available to Tclsh as auto-loaded packages.  At one point in time these packages were stored in the system file system but later they were moved.  Such a change would have caused issues with Tclsh if they were still looking for them in system.",
