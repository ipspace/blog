      "html": "I was probably (one of) the first one(s) using the AS_PATH prepending trick to generate the look-and-feel of a larger Internet in the Advanced BGP course. If I remember correctly, that was somewhere around 1995.<BR/><BR/>I'm pretty sure there were not too many people doing that before as the \"set as-path prepend\" command was brand new when I've started using it :)<BR/><BR/>The problem with the AS path prepending is that you cannot control the first AS, so the number of immediately adjacent ASes is equivalent to the number of extra routers you have (unless, of course, you get VRFsmart).",
