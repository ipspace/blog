  html: In some banks, OS/2 and token-ring are found in isolated pockets.  Given that,
    it would be no surprise that these guys will continue to run their TDM systems
    for another 15 years.  They have no business case for VoIP.

  html: None of the articles referred to discuss the use of VOIP for internal communications.
    That market is still growing.

  html: I recently read this article and was amazed that Network World has decided
    to pass itself off now as a &quot;shock &amp; awe&quot; tabloid. As a Senior Architect
    for a mid-cap bank ($13B), we are actively involved in the early stages of a large
    VoIP rollout. Wrong decision? I highly think not. <BR/><BR/>The decision to go
    VoIP, like very other technology, must be based on sound business &amp; architectural
    principles, not just trade-mag fad ideology. It must be a fit for your specific
    business, it must pass the grade on the ROI modeling, the run rate calculations
    and most importantly, you need to have an excellent grasp of your current architecture.
    <BR/><BR/>We have spent years designing and implementing our infrastructure to
    support all aspects of VoIP and for our model, VoIP makes perfect sense. Making
    sense on the financial, technological, &amp; even ideological model is important
    to please all aspects of the expense &amp; effort to go VoIP.<BR/><BR/>VoIP technology
    and its advantages will continue to deliver, but looks like with the current economy
    in question, it more than ever will require excellent engineering prowess &amp;
    extremely sound business case practices. <BR/><BR/>Cheers,<BR/>Andy

  html: It's a well written article.Voice over IP has been implemented in various
    ways using both proprietary and open protocols and standards.
