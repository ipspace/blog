In the last few years they've even started taking photos and submitting them back to Cisco to ensure the same person takes the exam each time. And at one point they were even taking fingerprints but they didn't do that the last couple of times I did my recert.",

It isn't like you have to have someone take a test for you if you know every question and answer that you will be given.<BR/><BR/>They should have 5 or 6 simulators on every exam that are pulled from a pool of 100.  The simulators should be scored separately and if you get less than 60% on the \"written\" portion or the \"simulator\" portion then you fail the whole exam.<BR/><BR/>Let them TestKing or Pass4Sure a pool of 100 sims.  By the time they memorize all that they might actually know something anyways!!!",
