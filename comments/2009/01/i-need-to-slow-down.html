            <div class="comment-content">Cisco has moved on. IOS is pretty much on cruise control, and it's been there for years. New releases and new features are rare, half baked and poorly supported. They still produce wonderful press releases, white papers and case studies. Working code - not so much. <BR/><BR/>But hey, if the rumors are correct, they'll be selling servers soon. I bet that'll help them focus :)</div>
