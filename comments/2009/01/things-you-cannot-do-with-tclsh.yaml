  html: Hi Ivan,<BR/><BR/>is it possible to use EEM/IPSLA to create a probe with one
    or more UDP packets and defining the content of the packets (multiple MAC address
    to wake up, I believe) with bcast destination address? We wouldn't use TCL, but
    EEM can be configured remotely via SNMP...

  html: If you know in advance who is the WOL target, you could probably prepare small
    file, save it in flash and upload it somewhere via tftp?

  html: Probably won't work unless you have an actual tftp server and span its traffic
    to WOL target (because tftp needs ack before file if sent).

  html: You also don&#39;t appear to be able to write a TCL script, add it as an alias&#39;d
    command and pipe to it ... something I only discovered *AFTER* writing and testing
    the script.   :&#39;(

  html: The &quot;pipe&quot; is actually part of the &quot;show&quot; command syntax.
    You can execute the &quot;show&quot; command within the Tcl script with the &quot;exec&quot;
    command and then filter the results.

  html: Yeah, I&#39;ve had similar comments from TAC.  I think I actually want a &quot;sort&quot;
    option added to the pipe - on the ASR, &quot;show ip nat translations&quot; is
    not sorted on inside local (like on most of the other IOS platforms I&#39;ve run
    NAT on).

  html: I have an EEM policy that adds a sort option to the command line output modifiers
    (i.e. things after the pipe).  I did it as a proof of concept for adding commands
    after pipe.  Unfortunately it requires EEM version 3.0 and the ASR has EEM version
    2.3.  The sort is rather rudimentary - throws away lines with too few columns
    and lines that contain a non-integer value in the specified column, but again
    it&#39;s just a proof of concept.  <br /><br />http://forums.cisco.com/eforum/servlet/EEM?page=eem&amp;fn=script&amp;scriptId=2427
