      "html": "Happy New Year, and nice video. You state: \"you want to move to an MPLS VPN service and the Service Provider is trying to persuade you to use BGP (which is a very good idea).\"  Could you elaborate on this? In my experience this makes things harder to deal with, I would prefer to run OSPF over MPLS. For example, let\u2019s say a company runs OSPF as the IGP throughout the network. If they run BGP on the WAN edge they have to redistribute twice, and they now have External routes in OSPF. Now let\u2019s say the company also has backup T1\u2019s or GRE over ADSL/Cable links. If they run OSPF over them they will be preferred. They could run BGP over the backup links, but now they cannot do DMVPN, and the complexity and convergence time has increased.<BR/><BR/>I would love to hear your thoughts/experiences regarding BGP as a MPLS WAN edge protocol.<BR/><BR/>Thank you,<BR/>Justin",
