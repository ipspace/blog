  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />a recent comment made by Tony Li[1] regarding eBGP multihop
    (which I interpret as being averse to it) reminded me I wanted to ask you about
    this, but never actually did. :) I&#39;ve been told (and I also remember reading
    somewhere) that eBGP is a Bad Thing and should be avoided, but I never found much
    details about why (granted, my google-fu might be low). I stumbled upon this blog
    post of yours, read the wiki article and found out about the TCP session hijacking
    issue (and how it can be mitigated). Also, because the neighbour is farther away,
    I&#39;m thinking the session is (statistically) more likely to be unstable (because
    there are more devices/links that may experience issues) compared to when the
    neighbour is directly connected. Besides those, are there any other reasons why
    eBGP multihop is a Bad Thing?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />[1] http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/nanog/users/129697#129697

  html: 'Let&#39;s try to be diplomatic: some very senior networking engineers have
    strong feelings about certain features (some about multihop EBGP, others about
    stateful firewalls), undoubtedly because they had to troubleshoot them way too
    often.<br /><br />Like with a number of other advanced features (and sharp knives)
    you can easily hurt yourself with multihop EBGP if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re
    doing, but it can also be tool that can save the day (admittedly mostly fixing
    bad designs).'
