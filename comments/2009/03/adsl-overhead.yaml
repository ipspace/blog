  html: I am amazed to understand why windows vista is not able to get the upload
    and download speed more than 2 Mbps. I made all the changes but no effect. Everytime
    speedguide shows the same output.<BR/><BR/>regards<BR/>shivlu jain

  html: You need a server with fast uplink that is close to you. Testing with a far-away
    server will always result in low throughput due to <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth-delay_product"

  html: It's for this reason that the best MTU to use for an ADSL connection is 1454
    over PPPoE, and 1462 over PPPoA.<BR/><BR/>http://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/?tag=ADSL_Theory_PPP<BR/><BR/>Further
    improvements can be made by tweaking RWIN, though good for a predictable VPN environment,
    this is fairly useless over the internet, as ideal RWIN value varies greatly,
    depending on the latency to the host you're receiving from, their upstream, and
    your provider's upstream, which is likely to be contended at least some of the
    time.

  html: '@Anonymous: Somehow my calculations of total overhead disagree with the link
    you''ve quoted by 4 bytes (so my "ideal" MTU is 1450 for PPPoE).<BR/><BR/>Anyhow,
    the differences are negligible. The ratio between "goodput" (application data)
    and raw bits on the wire is 85.82% for "optimal" MTU and 85,61% for MTU=1492.<BR/><BR/>Also
    note that a lot of packets are 40 bytes long (TCP ACK), where the overhead is
    a whooping 62,6%, so the debate about the "optimal" MTU is somewhat academic.'

  html: I think in a typical PPPoE ADSL connection we don't use RFC1483 bridging,
    but we use AAL5 SNAP encapsulation (also specified in RFC1483) with 8-byte header
    and 8-byte trailer. There is also a variable padding. I found this information
    here:<br /><br />Measuring the Utilization of ATM PVCs<br /><br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk362/technologies_tech_note09186a0080093c9a.shtml

  html: Hello<br />we here use business class ADSL link with RFC1483 protocol... directly
    routed links without any ppp negotiations.<br />We assume having zero overhead
    then?

  html: You still have to deal with RFC1483 encapsulation, AAL5 encapsulation and
    ATM cell tax (5 bytes of overhead in each 48-byte cell + some unused space in
    the last cell of the packet). Here&#39;s a good explanation of what you have:<br

    html: I don&#39;t think Ethernet FCS is included in the ATM payload, but then
      I may be wrong (wouldn&#39;t be the first time).

  html: You neglected the 4 byte Frame Check Sequence at the end of an ethernet frame.
    Therefore ethernet over head is 18 bytes not 14. That makes total overhead on
    PPPoE with LLC 42 bytes not 38. The optimal TCP/IP MTU is thus 1446 to fit into
    31 ATM cells with no padding.<br /><br />PPPoA VC-MUX<br />ATM 31*48 Full Cells
