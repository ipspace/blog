Follow the steps<BR/><BR/>1) Turn off the router<BR/>2) remove the flash<BR/>3) turn on the router<BR/>4) router will now go to rommon !!<BR/>5) change register value to 0x2142.<BR/>6) reset<BR/>7) turn off the router<BR/>8) place the flash back<BR/>9) THE END<BR/><BR/>Hope this helps",

      "html": "Pappyar, unless you know what you are talking about please do not offer advise!<br />Cisco configs are held in NVRAM not Flash, removing the flash will prevent the router from booting nothing else.<br />As Adam says a simple power reset will allow the use of the OTP as long as the config has not been saved.  If you do need to do a full password recovery then issuing a break sequence during bootup and then confreg 0x2142 will make the router ignore the startup-configuration. &gt;:o",
