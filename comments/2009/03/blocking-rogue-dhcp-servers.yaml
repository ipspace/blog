  html: Or use http://www.net.princeton.edu/software/dhcp_probe/ if your switches
    are unaware of DHCP snooping feature :)

  html: You have to be careful on the usage of "ip dhcp snooping limit rate", because
    if the limit is exceeded, then the port is err-disabled.<BR/>Still waiting for
    a fix to drop only dhcp traffic :(

  html: As I said, I would use the "ip dhcp snoop rate-limit" only on untrusted interfaces.
    There is no reason a correctly operating workstation should generate more than
    a few DHCP messages per second. If it does, it might be a good idea to disable
    the port and inform the administrators.

  html: for me the old &amp; simple dhcploc.exe has proven reliable over the years

  html: Ivan, there are some other cases too, where you can have untrusted interfaces
    and dhcp snooping.<BR/><BR/>i.e. a trunk interface where a vm or another switch
    (not managed by you, or not supporting dhcp snooping) is connected.<BR/>You want
    to snoop dhcp packets from a specific vlan on this interface, but you don't want
    to shut down the port if they exceed a limit, because there are other vlans passing
    through this interface too. You just want to drop those dhcp packets.

    html: Maybe you should ask the author of the book that made that claim.

  html: In some books written that, &#39;If a rogue device on an untrusted port attempts
    to send a DHCP response packet into the network, the port is SHUT DOWN&#39; .  But
    when I practised it untrusted port drop the DHCP response pakcets, but did not
    shut down the port.   In which situation the port got to shutdown state?
