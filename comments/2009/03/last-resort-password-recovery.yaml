  html: My question was hypothetical. What if we have an external flash and we just
    remove it from the router (and there is nothing on the system's flash/bootdisk)

  html: I tested it. If "no service password-recovery" is active then router complain
    on the console inability to load IOS after then it reload itself. So removing
    flash isn't a way to recover.

  html: No break key on my Macbook, so here's an option that I have verified works.
    (I gather it won't work if no service password-recovery is enabled though)<BR/><BR/>Complete
    these steps to simulate a break key sequence:<BR/><BR/>   1.<BR/><BR/>      Connect
    to the router with these terminal settings:<BR/><BR/>      1200 baud rate<BR/><BR/>      No
    parity<BR/><BR/>      8 data bits<BR/><BR/>      1 stop bit<BR/><BR/>      No
    flow control<BR/><BR/>      You no longer see any output on your screen, and this
    is normal.<BR/>   2.<BR/><BR/>      Power cycle (switch off and then on) the router
    and press the SPACEBAR for 10-15 seconds in order to generate a signal similar
    to the break sequence.<BR/>   3.<BR/><BR/>      Disconnect your terminal, and
    reconnect with a 9600 baud rate. You enter the ROM Monitor mode.

  html: The no service password-recovery still lets a 5-seconds interval for pressing
    the Break key...

  html: If all else fails, the 850/870 series have a cheap Intel flash soldered, and
    pin 15 to GND trick from the mighty WRT54G works here too. It will corrupt flash
    contents allowing you to go into ROMMON.

  html: Tried this and it has not worked for me on a Cisco 877.  The flash module
    is out and in my hand, and the console output still says &quot;PASSWORD RECOVERY
    FUNCTIONALITY IS DISABLED&quot;<br /><br />
