  html: What about real OTP? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password<BR/><BR/>A
    challenge-response OTP would help immensely when dealing with outsiders who want
    temp access.

  html: As long as you have not done a write mem, a reboot will allow you to use the
    one time password again

  html: The issue in this case would be that router will not allow you to go to rommon
    by using simple ctrl+break. Follow the steps<BR/><BR/>1) Turn off the router<BR/>2)
    remove the flash<BR/>3) turn on the router<BR/>4) router will now go to rommon
    !!<BR/>5) change register value to 0x2142.<BR/>6) reset<BR/>7) turn off the router<BR/>8)
    place the flash back<BR/>9) THE END<BR/><BR/>Hope this helps

  html: Pappyar, unless you know what you are talking about please do not offer advise!<br
    />Cisco configs are held in NVRAM not Flash, removing the flash will prevent the
    router from booting nothing else.<br />As Adam says a simple power reset will
    allow the use of the OTP as long as the config has not been saved.  If you do
    need to do a full password recovery then issuing a break sequence during bootup
    and then confreg 0x2142 will make the router ignore the startup-configuration.
