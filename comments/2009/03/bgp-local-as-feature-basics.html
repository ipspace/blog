            <p class="comment-content">I got to know the &quot;bgp enforce-first-as&quot; command when studying the BGP Best-Path Selection Algorithm. By looking at the output of the &quot;show ip bgp&quot; command when implementing BGP Local-AS, I said, ahha, this is the time to prove the working of the &quot;bgp enforce-first-as&quot; command.<br />So I went conf t, router bgp, bgp enforce, show ip bgp, hmm, still here, this should be the time for me to test out another command - soft-configuration inbound, followed by clear ip bgp x.x.x.x soft in, hmm, the BGP route is still here, clear ip bgp x.x.x.x, aargghhh, still there. &gt;:o<br /><br />show run, hey, where is my &quot;bgp enforce-first-as&quot; command? What? It is enabled by default? @_@<br /><br />After some thought, another ASN (the local AS) actually being prepended to the AS_SEQUENCE by the local router, the EBGP peer doing its job correctly therefore not being discarded by the &quot;bgp enforce-first-as&quot; command.<br /><br />I think I will only able to see the operation of the &quot;bgp enforce-first-as&quot; when reading more about BGP route spoofing attacks in the future, now it is good enough for my ROUTE exam. :)</p>

            <p class="comment-content">You can&#39;t generate an AS-number mismatch that the &quot;bgp enforce-first-as&quot; would catch with an IOS BGP feed, you need a broken implementation for that.</p>
