      "html": "The uplink to the ISP went down, but your default route stayed in the routing table (which, from memory, is what happens to statics that use an interface as the target), which resulted in all your outbound traffic being black-holed silently (as opposed to the default route being withdrawn and the router dropping the traffic in a more graceful way).  For example, if you were to ping out to the WAN, you would get timeouts rather than the CE router responding with &quot;no route to host&quot;.<br /><br />BTW, I&#39;m curious as to why you didn&#39;t want to include the PE router&#39;s IP address in the default route?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Rob.",
