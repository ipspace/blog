Naturally there is a morass of middle-people between you and your readers: publishers, lawyers, marketers, etc. and some of these issues are not under your direct control. It is nice to know that the author also can see the frustrations of DRM.<br /><br />The content of your book is excellent. And of course with the inclusion of the R&amp;S 4.0 blueprint this book will extremely useful for R&amp;S candidates.  Also, I would like to say thank you to you and NIL for the IP Corner articles.",
