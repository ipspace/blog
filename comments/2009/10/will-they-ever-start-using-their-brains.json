      "html": "It&#39;s still not possible ;) You have to do at least three memory fetches for each packet:<br /><br />* read the buffer descriptor (it&#39;s invalidated from the CPU cache when the NIC flips the &quot;available&quot; bit).<br />* read the IP address fields (to perform lookup in the whatever-ID table on source IP address).<br />* read the checksum (they call it HMAC) in the packet.<br /><br />You cannot read the IP address field until you know where the buffer is, so you have at least two CAS latencies (reading the checksum could be, in theory, overlapped with reading the IP address). 6ns is still science fiction ... unless, of course, you have a fantastic architecture, wildly fast CPU with lots of cache, multiple SDRAMs and multi-threaded  hand-optimized packet rejector.",

      "html": "&quot;He says during lab tests, when a 10Gbps link to a server was filled with legitimate traffic and then with attack packets, network latency increased by 30 nanosec. &quot;For humans, there is no difference,&quot; he says. Users don&#39;t sense the attack is underway, he says, and it remains possible for network security teams to trace the command and control center behind attacks. &quot;<br /><br />Might be interesting to understand the exact traffic profile and how this 30 nanosec was derived... I think you will &quot;understand&quot; where this 6ns figure came from.<br /><br />Generally, people won&#39;t give any details to make sure no correlation is possible to find the hole in the theory",
