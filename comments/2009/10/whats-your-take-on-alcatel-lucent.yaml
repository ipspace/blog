  html: Hi,<br /><br />This is being pushed by all Vendors.<br /><br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/routers/ps5763/prod_white_paper0900aecd80395e03.html<br

    />Mgmt is G709. Which in time (I guess) will be replaced by GMPLS. It&#39;s not
    mature yet but I&#39;m sold.<br /><br />its all Ethernet from the router side..
    <br /><br />a) LANPHY IPoETHo(ProboDWDM)<br />b) WANPHY IPoEthoSDH(ProboDWDM)<br
    />c) WDMPHY IPoDWDM<br /><br />It DOES look good and looks to me to be going in
    the right direction.. Just needs to mature as a IP Backbone technology.

  html: ALU has been doing many things right in the past few years. It largely goes
    unnoticed, because ALU has *really* bad reputation with smaller ISPs and Telcos
    from the old days of Telephony world (in short, they would &quot;talk&quot; to
    incumbent only). They have been trying to get away with that and with some really
    great products. For example, their ESS switches are masterpiece that solves so
    many problems people using Cisco are facing every day.<br /><br />This new launch
    is probably continuation of that policy and thinking. It remains to be seen how
    it does on the marked, dominated by C&amp;J.

  html: Sounds strangely familiar to the Newbridge IP-over ATM Convergence campaign
    (of which I was a part) in the late90&#39;s.  Lets see.. lets move IP directly
    to ATM (over fiber) Converge Video, Image, Voice  &amp; Data on one medium and
    one transport.  <br />Great Idea then, never quite made it.<br /><br />Good luck
