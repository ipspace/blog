Which in time (I guess) will be replaced by GMPLS. It&#39;s not mature yet but I&#39;m sold.<br /><br />its all Ethernet from the router side.. <br /><br />a) LANPHY IPoETHo(ProboDWDM)<br />b) WANPHY IPoEthoSDH(ProboDWDM)<br />c) WDMPHY IPoDWDM<br /><br />It DOES look good and looks to me to be going in the right direction.. Just needs to mature as a IP Backbone technology.",

      "html": "ALU has been doing many things right in the past few years. It largely goes unnoticed, because ALU has *really* bad reputation with smaller ISPs and Telcos from the old days of Telephony world (in short, they would &quot;talk&quot; to incumbent only). They have been trying to get away with that and with some really great products. For example, their ESS switches are masterpiece that solves so many problems people using Cisco are facing every day.<br /><br />This new launch is probably continuation of that policy and thinking. It remains to be seen how it does on the marked, dominated by C&amp;J.",
