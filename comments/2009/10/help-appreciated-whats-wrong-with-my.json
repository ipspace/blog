Having it on multiple laptops for easy access is also a big thing for me.<br /><br />I think a pricing of just below the $10 mark would be appropriate. Taking a book like the new R&amp;S guide, in printed format is $76 on Amazon.com. This book is 1200 pages. That makes out to about $0.06 per page in printed format. This book, by the same measure is then $6.72. Ofcourse amount of sales and other factors will influence this alot, its still the best guideline I can come up with. So $10 would be a good price for me.<br /><br />Hope that helps a bit.",

With both Firefox and IE8...<br /><br />I&#39;m left bewildered and wondering if I purchased something I can&#39;t even open.

      "html": "Well, some of my thought have been echoed by others, but here goes...  I wasn&#39;t aware of this book until I read your post, but i took a look at it on Safari and liked the content, so I purchased the PDF through Safari. <br /><br />The first and perhaps biggest issue is DRM, as some others have noted. You are marketing this book to technologists, who understand the risks posed to the consumer by DRM. The PDF I purchased through Safari does not have DRM (although each page is tagged with my Safari username.) As a rule I do not purchase electronic media that has DRM. On the few rare occasions that I have purchased a secured PDF, I immediately printed the file on a Windows computer and extracted the PS file from the print spool directory. Whether it is Amazon clawing back a Kindle ebook due to some licensing snafu, or some company going bankrupt and taking my DRM permissions with them, there are simply too many risks associated with DRM.<br /><br />The second reason for me is the publication date. Unfortunately, in our industry, a book published in 2006 has the word *stale* written all over it.  I am not saying that your book is stale, I am saying it looks stale by virtue of the publication date.  When I am searching on Safari and I see a publication date of 2006 I am unlikely to click, simply because it is too time consuming to look any further. While this is true for a book focused on some standard or protocol, it is doubly true for a book about a vendor implementation. If the topic has evolved or changed enough to warrant a new edition, then release a new edition.<br /><br />A third reason may be the pricepoint. $14.95 seems steep for a 100 page book that is this narrow in focus. On Safari, the nominal cost of a token is $2, so I paid $6 for my PDF of the book (ignoring the sunk cost of my subscription.) However I am curious, when you mention that 200 copies have been sold, what does that number include? Does that number reflect regular Safari users (reading online) and Safari PDF purchasers (like me)?",
