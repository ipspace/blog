  html: Ivan, maybe we should coin a new phrase that means that a device/system is
    entirely ready to perform all of it&#39;s functions using IPv6 in the same way
    that it does using IPv4, in the manner that you have explained.<br /><br />Maybe
    something like &#39;IPv6-equipped&#39;, &#39;IPv6-primed&#39;, &#39;IPv6-fit&#39;
    or my personal favourite &#39;IPv6-ripe&#39;, although that could get confused
    with a certain RIR. What do you think?

  html: How about IPv6-capable being no to one or both of the above questions and
    IPv6-ready being yes to both.

  html: Don&#39;t even try to go there. Before you know, we&#39;ll have &quot;IPV6-wholegrain&quot;
    and &quot;IPv6-organic&quot;, not to mention GreenV6.

  html: Duncan, if we could agree on terminology and be able to force it onto the
    vendors&#39; marketing departments, I wouldn&#39;t need to write posts like this
    one  :-E
