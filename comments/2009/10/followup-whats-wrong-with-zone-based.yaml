  html: 'Ivan,<br /><br />Kudos to you for asking the question. Naturally there is
    a morass of middle-people between you and your readers: publishers, lawyers, marketers,
    etc. and some of these issues are not under your direct control. It is nice to
    know that the author also can see the frustrations of DRM.<br /><br />The content
    of your book is excellent. And of course with the inclusion of the R&amp;S 4.0
    blueprint this book will extremely useful for R&amp;S candidates.  Also, I would
    like to say thank you to you and NIL for the IP Corner articles.'
