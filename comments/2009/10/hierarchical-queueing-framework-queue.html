            <div class="comment-content">Oh, finally they started posting &quot;something&quot; detailed on CBWFQ (Be it HQF or pre-HQF) :) I remember i had to spend hours on simulation scenarios to find just how exactly CBWFQ works (which eventually appeared to be just WFQ with some steroids - ah well, they all come from GPS anyways :)<br /><br />However, I still cannot find any good explanation of pre-HQF: fair-queue + random-detect in class-default behavior in this article! <br /><br />Plus, I particularly enjoy this one: &quot;In pre-HQF IOS images, generally speaking, any class with a bandwidth command will generally be prioritized against classes without bandwidth or priority based on the classes’ Weight&quot;. There are so many details hidden behind this generally sound sentence ;)<br /><br />However, the good news is the slow progress towards unified queuing solution and configuration syntax for all platforms/link technologies. Wish one day this could be true for hardware-optimized systems ;)</div>
