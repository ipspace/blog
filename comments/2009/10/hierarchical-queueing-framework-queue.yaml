  html: "Oh, finally they started posting &quot;something&quot; detailed on CBWFQ\
    \ (Be it HQF or pre-HQF) :) I remember i had to spend hours on simulation scenarios\
    \ to find just how exactly CBWFQ works (which eventually appeared to be just WFQ\
    \ with some steroids - ah well, they all come from GPS anyways :)<br /><br />However,\
    \ I still cannot find any good explanation of pre-HQF: fair-queue + random-detect\
    \ in class-default behavior in this article! <br /><br />Plus, I particularly\
    \ enjoy this one: &quot;In pre-HQF IOS images, generally speaking, any class with\
    \ a bandwidth command will generally be prioritized against classes without bandwidth\
    \ or priority based on the classes\u2019 Weight&quot;. There are so many details\
    \ hidden behind this generally sound sentence ;)<br /><br />However, the good\
    \ news is the slow progress towards unified queuing solution and configuration\
    \ syntax for all platforms/link technologies. Wish one day this could be true\
    \ for hardware-optimized systems ;)"
