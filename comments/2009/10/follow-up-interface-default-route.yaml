  html: I worked on a similar problem years ago. A campus had set every desktop&#39;s
    default gateway to its own IP address &amp; relied on proxy-arp for Internet connectivity.
    <br /><br />The campus core was an AGS+. It kept up OK until the combination of
    increased desktop count and increased Internet traffic buried it. <br /><br />--Mike

  html: What does this configuration result in if this is an IPv6 environment? No
    ARP broadcasts, does it use the IPv6 neighbors? Would the same sluggish performance
    be seen?
