  html: I hope the new licensing model will take in consideration all the students
    like me using dynamips to prepare for cisco certifications. It would be great
    to have a full feature IOS with performance limitations for study purposes. I
    think dynamips/dynages/GNS3 are some of the most powerful marketing tools for
    Cisco! If I study Cisco, it&#39;s reasonable that I&#39;ll buy Cisco. Why they
    don&#39;t support dynamips???  :&#39;(

  html: Usually there is a kind of grace period in Cisco&#39;s universal images (e.g.
    in the 3750E series switches). Guess we can use this &quot;feature&quot; for dynamips
    as well ...

  html: It is a good news from exploit developer, it&#39;ll be easier to get exploitable
    pointer.<br />Of course it will take few years to be wide spread.

  html: To the list of &quot;really new&quot;:<br />- multigigabit fabric (MGF), SM
    can speak to each other directly<br />- energy efficiency, you can standby some
    module, you can use two power adaptor together

  html: I read performance and I don&#39;t understand results (3925 =&gt; 100 Mbps
    ???)<br />what are they talk about ? interfaces are gigabit on these routers<br
    /><br />I have tons of 3825 hsec/k9 with aim-VPN card and in routing/nat they
    push at 700/800 Mbps<br />and in VPN Ipsec (esp aes256) =&gt; 160 Mbps<br /><br
    />so first I don&#39;t see any improvements and then I don&#39;t understand this
    &quot;100 Mbps&quot;

  html: I&#39;m really hoping Cisco will have the decency to release free or low-cost
    &quot;educational&quot; licenses for IOS under this new scheme. Ideally these
    would enable all features yet cripple throughput to perhaps 10 Mbps (or less).<br
    /><br />It would also be nice to see them move away from compressed images. Image
    decompression accounts for a significant portion of boot time, and Flash is so
    cheap these days there&#39;s really no reason for it.

  html: 'Amazing!<br />On day Win7 was available worldwide on the market, I almost
    heard about 30 times the words &quot;Windows 7&quot; in my car on the radio in
    the morning. <br /><br />Why didn&#39;t I heared about worldwide availbility of
    the new cisco ISRs also in the radio? Shame on Cisco marketing team : they were
    not able to force my collegues at work to talk about the new ISRs all day long!  :-P'
