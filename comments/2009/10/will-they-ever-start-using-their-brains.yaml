  html: They do not need to fetch each packet on it own.<br /><br />Modern NIC will
    interrupt once for a bunch of packets.<br /><br />So, on average, it is possible
    to read packets in 6ns. But even with that your doubts are still relevant.

  html: It&#39;s still not possible ;) You have to do at least three memory fetches
    for each packet:<br /><br />* read the buffer descriptor (it&#39;s invalidated
    from the CPU cache when the NIC flips the &quot;available&quot; bit).<br />* read
    the IP address fields (to perform lookup in the whatever-ID table on source IP
    address).<br />* read the checksum (they call it HMAC) in the packet.<br /><br
    />You cannot read the IP address field until you know where the buffer is, so
    you have at least two CAS latencies (reading the checksum could be, in theory,
    overlapped with reading the IP address). 6ns is still science fiction ... unless,
    of course, you have a fantastic architecture, wildly fast CPU with lots of cache,
    multiple SDRAMs and multi-threaded  hand-optimized packet rejector.

  html: It have enough time to drop ALL packets :)

  html: '&quot;He says during lab tests, when a 10Gbps link to a server was filled
    with legitimate traffic and then with attack packets, network latency increased
    by 30 nanosec. &quot;For humans, there is no difference,&quot; he says. Users
    don&#39;t sense the attack is underway, he says, and it remains possible for network
    security teams to trace the command and control center behind attacks. &quot;<br
    /><br />Might be interesting to understand the exact traffic profile and how this
    30 nanosec was derived... I think you will &quot;understand&quot; where this 6ns
    figure came from.<br /><br />Generally, people won&#39;t give any details to make
    sure no correlation is possible to find the hole in the theory'

  html: Why don&#39;t you try emailing him (Chun-Ching Andy Huang)?   Actually I am
    curious about this myself since his actual thesis didn&#39;t include the calculation
    on how he arrived on that ~5ns time quoted.  I can&#39;t find his email so I&#39;ll
    email his thesis directo, his home page is here (http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~wu/).
