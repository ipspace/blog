It would be great to have a full feature IOS with performance limitations for study purposes. I think dynamips/dynages/GNS3 are some of the most powerful marketing tools for Cisco! If I study Cisco, it&#39;s reasonable that I&#39;ll buy Cisco. Why they don&#39;t support dynamips???  :&#39;(",

Ideally these would enable all features yet cripple throughput to perhaps 10 Mbps (or less).<br /><br />It would also be nice to see them move away from compressed images. Image decompression accounts for a significant portion of boot time, and Flash is so cheap these days there&#39;s really no reason for it.",
