  html: Actually it&#39;s not ... I can&#39;t promise guaranteed response times, won&#39;t
    do mission-critical troubleshooting, upgrade your software or ship you replacement
    parts (or replace broken equipment in your network).

  html: Of course, but very often some troubleshooting tips (without bureaucracy)
    can&#39;t save hours. For me it&#39;s a good idea also in plan/design phase. <br
    />For my point of view product is directed for enterprise segment (not normal
    users). From perspective of enterprise spending 300$ for 60-90 minutes with world
    class expert is amazing opportunity.<br /><br />mirek from http://www.onesmallthingtodo.com

  html: It&#39;s definitely not a consumer-grade/SMB service, but you&#39;d be surprised
    by the range of existing users - anything from small consulting companies verifying
    their ideas and system integrators checking their designs to high-end enterprises
    or service providers that need specific in-depth expertise.
