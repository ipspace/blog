Nice &amp; concise API. You might want to consider adding lldpad support (not sure lldpad publishes its information in SNMP format).",

Combined with the arp table you can map ip/mac to a switch port.<br /><br />snmp::info has modules for doing this as well, but I use netdisco(which uses snmp::info) which  dumps everything into a sql database.
