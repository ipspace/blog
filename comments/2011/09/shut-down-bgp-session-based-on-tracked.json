In our case, killing the whole BGP session is just as good, so we&#39;ll try this approach.",

When I&#39;ve tried to implement it locally, I was tracking Loopback interface which shutdowns using EEM script based on HSRP event - everything worked fine (including few manual tests) for a few days before huge traffic flow brought my ISR2901 to the knees and HSRP event occurred, effectively shutting Loopback interface down. However, we haven&#39;t lost route to the BGP peer (somehow static route haven&#39;t been removed by Loopback tracking event). Am I missing something?",
