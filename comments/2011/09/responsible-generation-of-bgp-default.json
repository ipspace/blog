      "html": "Pretty cool Ivan.<br />If your ToR switches are L3, running BGP, you could use a similar technique to gracefully take a Spine switch out of service for maintenance, or other problems.  Just log in to the Spine switch and shutdown the Loopback interface that would trigger BGP to remove route advertisements to the ToR switches.  The ToR move the flows to another Spine switch, at which point you can begin your maintenance.  RIght?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Brad",

      "html": "Hi,<br /><br />regarding this comment:<br /><br />&quot;The catch is in the \u201cmatch in the IP routing table\u201d part \u2013 you cannot use any of the BGP attributes as matching criteria in the route map.&quot;<br /><br />Well, you can use BGP attibutes as long as you match an ip prefix in the routing table. So, Ip prefix in the routing table AND BGP Attribute will work. By the way, running some tests I found out something interesting:<br /><br />- An Ip prefix, 1.0.0.0/8, is generated by two different routers in different AS&#39;es (lets say AS 1 and AS 2) . The eBGP neighbor of those is advertising the default conditionally as long as it receives the 1.0.0.0/8 from AS 1. So, it generates the default just in case it receives it from AS 1 and it works. If we receive it from AS 2, it will not be generated.<br /><br />However, if we create a static route 1.0.0.0/8 pointing to null 0, it generates the default route, even though is local and obviously is not receiving it from AS 1. But, if you add a sentence matching the next hop of the eBGP neighbor (AS 1) in the route-map, it will not generate the default. So, it seems that it checks the routing table first and then, if there is a valid match, it checks the Local BGP Table.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />Jose.",
