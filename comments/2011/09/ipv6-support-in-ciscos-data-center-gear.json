Or neighbor unreachability/dead gateway detection with Ipv6 icmp redirects for local router only?",

Based on configuration guide it seems that the minimum RA interval you can set is 3 seconds and RA lifetime has to be at least twice the RA interval (or a single lost RA packet might cause problems).<br /><br />Is 8-10 seconds good enough for you? Tweak RA timers. Less than that? Use NHRP.",
