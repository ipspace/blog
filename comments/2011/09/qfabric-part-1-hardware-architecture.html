            <div class="comment-content">Your QFabric diagram is actually overly-simplified: each QF/Node has to have dual connections to the Control Plane, and this is achieved by having separate GbE copper connections to separate EX4200-based Virtual Chassis. Similarly the QF/Directors - the &quot;Director Group&quot; - has multiple connections (3..?) to the same VCs, and much the same for the QF/Interconnects. This is obvioulsy all about redundancy (good), but it does place significant restrictions on the physical topolgy of a QFabric Switch deployment. Everything needs to be within something like a 100m reach, and with the cable routing requirements of a real-world Data Centre I&#39;m not sure how practical the scale-out capabilities will be... Facoring in the pricing, the high start-up costs for QF/I, QF/D, and all of the software licensing, it&#39;s difficult to see where the economies of scale will be achieved.

            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;d be very nervous about putting my entire network under one control plane, even with redundancy. It just takes one memory leak in the controller plus a failover bug to take down every switch in the network. Not to mention the idea of a switch stack as critical to control-plane functioning.<br /><br />There&#39;s a reason distributed architectures have been favored for thirty years.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Am I missing something, or is QFabric basically a giant chassis switch with each card broken into separate 1-2U device, with custom cabling lashing it all together? Once you get to the ingress port, it&#39;s all totally proprietary, and not at all &quot;distributed&quot;,&quot;scale-out&quot; or anything else buzzword-complaint. Cisco couldn&#39;t have dreamed up a better proprietary non-solution to what customers need.<br /><br />Give me a bunch of 48+ port TOR-style switches connected with a folded-Clos (or fattened butterfly or 3D torus or whatever) topology that can be managed as one, have one unified control plane, and do ECMP across all links at layer 2 and layer 3. Bonus points for some smart adaptive routing that doesn&#39;t require global information sharing. <br /><br />Plug-and-play, scale-out networking. That&#39;s revolutionary. QFabric isn&#39;t.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Although QFabric has to mature for sure,  the concept seems ingeniously simple. Instead of building a flat layer 2 network out a bunch of vendor pushed half-baked &quot;standards&quot;, Juniper seems to be extending upon an idea most are comfortable, a distributed layer2/layer3 switch. <br /><br /> Is it just me or does it seem ripe for eventual OpenFlow support?  To me it seems that the QF/Director must act in many ways like an OpenFlow Controller.<br /><br />  I agree the cost could be a prohibiting point, but I&#39;m impressed with premise.  Maybe some day they will release a scaled down version to gain footing in smaller deployments</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Except there&#39;s nothing that prevents a scale-out architecture from doing source-routing using port numbers (or whatever headers are used on QFabric&#39;s proprietery links) instead of MACs. Many HPC interconnects work exactly this way.<br /><br />QFrabric is &quot;brilliant&quot; in the same way the Spruce Goose was brilliant. Impressive engineering, but a solution looking for a problem, and at way too high of a cost.<br />The cost of a redundant QFabric system is something like $2100 per host-facing 10 GbE port with 3:1 oversubscription for 1920 host-facing ports. A two-stage folded-clos network of the same size, also with 3:1 osub at the edge, would only be about $600 per host-facing port based on current list pricing of 56 * (48-port 10 GbE switch) pricing from other vendors (assuming such switches could someday actually do TRILL or other L2 ECMP).<br /><br />Arista/Dell/HP: Juniper messed up, and you&#39;ve got a big opportunity here.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ryan,<br /><br />Is your argument that you have to deploy two fabrics for redundancy? We have had a couple of early customers consider that path and elect to go with a single fabric instead. While the fabric behaves like a single switch, it is designed to be as resilient as the network many would like to deploy, but rarely do in practice.<br /><br />As far as cost goes. We believe there is significant value that goes along with providing applications with the performance they want, infrastructure flexibility rarely found before, and what should be significant operational savings that typically overshadow the capital cost of a network. Time will tell which and to what degree those assumptions are true. <br /><br />On the size front, there are those who have accused us of building something specifically for large search engines and such and others who say a 6000 port fabric is too small for their needs. We&#39;ve said we know how to scale the architecture up and down, so don&#39;t count us out yet. This game is just getting interesting.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Abner from Juniper</div>

Geez...back in the day, Bay Networks Centillion did the same exact thing, with a complex redundant backplane that was way ahead of it&#39;s time.

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan.<br /><br />Still I can&#39;t understand the &quot;one-lookup&quot; statement. I clearly see that the Edge Node will perform one lookup, decide which way to reach the destination QFabric port, and embed that forwarding information into the proprietary frame format for the Interconnect to use it to send the packet accordingly.<br /><br />What I see is that, if this assumption is correct, the Interconnect must itself perform another, non-standard lookup in order to read that proprietary forwarding information and switch the frame to the destination node... which I assume will somehow know which port to place it into.<br /><br />I see one &quot;Ethernet destination MAC address&quot; lookup, and two &quot;proprietary forwarding information header&quot; lookups.<br /><br />Where am I wrong? I surely must be missing something.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">OK.<br /><br />What I don&#39;t see then is convergence time information. I understand that for the edge node to attach the proper &quot;tag&quot;, it must have visibility of the topology relevant to its connected nodes. Therefore, every topology change (like a VM move) must trigger a FIB update to edge nodes from the QF Directors.<br /><br />With potentially hundreds of edge nodes... What procedure is used to guarantee timely convergence times for the distribution of this info? What is the target convergence times advertised by JNPR?<br /><br />As usual, congrats on the post Ivan.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Gotta agree with Ben here.<br /><br />Not that distributed, Ivan, as only first-tier protocols (LACP and such) are distributed. Forwarding information base building is delegated to a single control plane, with no visibility into how this information is propagated, what split-horizon mechanisms are implemented, how its coherence is protected... It&#39;s basically a huge black-box with regards to Control Plane.<br /><br />Plus, it relies upon the stability of a separate out-of-band control network, with its own overlapping control plane...<br /><br />Talk about stone age, Chris... ;)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,  <br /> <br />One comment on &quot;totally proprietary.&quot; To be clear - and I don&#39;t want to put words into your mouth - you are referring to the internals of the system that actually create the fabric. Just like a chassis switch system, the internal components are proprietary, while all external facing ports are Ethernet and/or fiber channel. More here: http://j.mp/ov18e2  <br /> <br />Our view is that creating a protocol based fabric can get you slightly better efficiency and any to any connectivity than legacy kit, but switch fabrics will deliver much better efficiency, predictability, performance, security, and manageability. We expect those benefits to outweigh the complexity protocol based fabrics will foist on customers. While some have suggested the only way to deploy a QFabric is in a greenfield DC, that would be insane on our part. Early customers are deploying in a corner of the datacenter and expanding from there. I also expect the economics to get more interesting over time.  <br /> <br />Cheers,  <br />Abner (Juniper Networks)</div>
