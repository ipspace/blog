  html: 'Great to see that someone outside the Perl community knows SNMP::Info!<br
    />We recently switched to git and development it going ahead faster than ever
    before since.<br />You might want to use metacpan these days for nicer links:

  html: Oh, it was easy - started with &quot;there must be an LLDP API somewhere&quot;
    ... &quot;probably in PERL&quot; ... &quot;let&#39;s ask Google&quot; ... &quot;Ah,
    thought so ;)&quot;<br /><br />Great job. Nice &amp; concise API. You might want
    to consider adding lldpad support (not sure lldpad publishes its information in
    SNMP format).

  html: Also worth noting HP and extreme both do LLDP and support the management address
    TLV. Though with extreme the default is for LLDP not to send the address and it&#39;s
    an extra config command to enable it.

  html: From an initial peruse of Open Flow it appears to be just an Object Oriented
    language or API to the network&#39;s protocols. But then again just use IPv6 and
    code your flow label fields to provide the space for the same result ;)

  html: LLDP will give you more information, but you really don&#39;t need to use
    it for this.  The regular mac address table mibs will tell you what nodes are
    connected to what ports.  Combined with the arp table you can map ip/mac to a
    switch port.<br /><br />snmp::info has modules for doing this as well, but I use
    netdisco(which uses snmp::info) which  dumps everything into a sql database.  This
    makes doing things like generating your network topology a piece of cake.

  html: BTW Microsoft include LLDP driver and enable it by default  in Windows8 at
    least on developer preview.
