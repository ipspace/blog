But just how many of them want to be running Cisco and VMware??? <br /><br />Another point that&#39;s not widely appreciated is that getting in and out of these VxLANs starts to look a whole lot like routing, very likely creating islands of VxLANs within the provider routed out to the rest of the world.<br /><br />And while I agree that &#39;introduction of VXLAN, the networking world hasn\u2019t changed a bit: the vendors are still serving us all isolated incompatible technologies&#39;, I&#39;ll also argue it also makes the remaining gaps more apparent and important.",

This would create issues when a VM migrates to a physical server connected to a different VTEP. Since VMs belonging to different tenants can have same MAC and IP addresses, how does the new VTEP know the VNI of the migrated VM?",

LISP enabled sites still needs to setup PITR (Proxy ITR) and advertise the EID subnets to attract traffic initialized from non LISP clients. During the transition period, there is no reduce of the size of Internet routing table.<br /><br />Since the traffic are proxied (tunneled) between PITR to ETR, the route path for non LISP enabled sites is: Client-PITR-ETR-EID. This might not be the optimal path and may have performance impact that hindering the adoption of this technology.<br />!<br />Make it as one statement: Enable LISP will only benefit customers that having LISP enabled which is a minority of the Internet community. The majority of the customers may get a worse performance until switching to LISP. This makes me thinking adopting LISP might not be a wise decision.<br />!<br />If none LISP enabled customers having the same performance, that might be a easier decision. <br />!<br />If LISP is where Internet goes, a shared (or free) PITR infrastructure may excellerate the implementation.",
