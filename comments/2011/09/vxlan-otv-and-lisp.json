But just how many of them want to be running Cisco and VMware??? <br /><br />Another point that&#39;s not widely appreciated is that getting in and out of these VxLANs starts to look a whole lot like routing, very likely creating islands of VxLANs within the provider routed out to the rest of the world.<br /><br />And while I agree that &#39;introduction of VXLAN, the networking world hasn’t changed a bit: the vendors are still serving us all isolated incompatible technologies&#39;, I&#39;ll also argue it also makes the remaining gaps more apparent and important.",

This would create issues when a VM migrates to a physical server connected to a different VTEP. Since VMs belonging to different tenants can have same MAC and IP addresses, how does the new VTEP know the VNI of the migrated VM?",
