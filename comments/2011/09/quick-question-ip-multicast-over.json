The streams source IP was an RFC-1918 that I couldn&#39;t route on our multicast enabled backbone, so I NAT&#39;d the stream to a routeable addresses using a PIX prior to sending outbound from the site. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the source had a TTL of 4, and the broadcast TV guys that uplinked the stream didn&#39;t know how to change that, so I stuffed the stream into GRE tunnels before crossing the backbone., just to keep the TTL from decrementing.<br /><br /> 8-)",
