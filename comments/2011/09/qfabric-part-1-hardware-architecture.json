We have had a couple of early customers consider that path and elect to go with a single fabric instead. While the fabric behaves like a single switch, it is designed to be as resilient as the network many would like to deploy, but rarely do in practice.<br /><br />As far as cost goes. We believe there is significant value that goes along with providing applications with the performance they want, infrastructure flexibility rarely found before, and what should be significant operational savings that typically overshadow the capital cost of a network. Time will tell which and to what degree those assumptions are true. <br /><br />On the size front, there are those who have accused us of building something specifically for large search engines and such and others who say a 6000 port fabric is too small for their needs. We&#39;ve said we know how to scale the architecture up and down, so don&#39;t count us out yet. This game is just getting interesting.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Abner from Juniper",

Just like a chassis switch system, the internal components are proprietary, while all external facing ports are Ethernet and/or fiber channel. More here: http://j.mp/ov18e2  <br /> <br />Our view is that creating a protocol based fabric can get you slightly better efficiency and any to any connectivity than legacy kit, but switch fabrics will deliver much better efficiency, predictability, performance, security, and manageability. We expect those benefits to outweigh the complexity protocol based fabrics will foist on customers. While some have suggested the only way to deploy a QFabric is in a greenfield DC, that would be insane on our part. Early customers are deploying in a corner of the datacenter and expanding from there. I also expect the economics to get more interesting over time.  <br /> <br />Cheers,  <br />Abner (Juniper Networks)",
