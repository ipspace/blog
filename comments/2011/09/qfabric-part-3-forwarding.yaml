  html: '&quot;Shared default router MAC address&quot;<br /><br />can we configure
    a couple of 7600, 3550 or 4948 to behave like this ?<br />Force the same MAC,
    and same IP on the interface vlans, add some filters, and let the hosts with their
    default routes (bonding with failover).<br /><br />Has anyone ever tried something
    like that ?'

  html: I have a few questions. I have read your post now like five times and I am
    for sure speaking above my pay grade so maybe you can clear this up for me.<br
    /><br />1) One lookup per packet.<br />This sounds great, but the interconnect
    cant just forward frames based on nothing. It will still have to use something
    to determine which node to send the frame to...be it a label slapped on the front
    of the frame or something else. Since forwarding decisions are made in hardware
    how does QFabric add anything to this area? In theoretical application how does
    this differ from MPLS?<br /><br />2) Shared default router MAC address.<br />You
    assume we&#39;re doing L3 routing at the access layer. If we&#39;re doing routing
    at the distribution layer this is taken care of. Yes we still have traffic trombones,
    but if you want to go the traffic trombone route the only way I see QFabric could
    help with this is if you had a QFabric split between two datacenters. I&#39;m
    not even sure they would support that design. So if we assume we have two QFabric
    deployments in two different datacenters we&#39;re back to the same design challenges
    we face today.<br /><br />3) L2/L3 Same Path<br />I like this...but if we&#39;re
    routing at the access Layer why not use MPLS and set up VPLS? Would this not accomplish
    the same thing? I think I just made the biggest traffic trombone in the world,
    but if I am accurate then I am sure smart engineers at Cisco, Brocade, or HP could
    come up with a way to have each access switch act as the default route for hosts
    hanging off of it. Obviously this would need to include the distribution layer
    so it knows which access switch to forward to.<br /><br />Can someone break this
    down for me?

  html: In theory we could, but it would be fragile, as you can&#39;t enforce that
    (A) all VLANs are configured on all boxes and (B) there is no other L2 box in
    the middle that could break things.<br /><br />Also, using today&#39;s implementations,
    every switch would get crazy seeing its own MAC address coming from various sources
    (not to mention duplicate MAC addresses). ARP might even work, but you would get
    repeated ARP requests from various switches as the VM moves around.

  html: '#1 - they need some labeling scheme in the fabric, similar (in concept) to
    MPLS/VPN. The ingress node has to indicate egress interface with the label.<br
    /><br />#2 - You&#39;re absolutely right. You get optimal forwarding within the
    QFabric, not between QFabric and external L3 forwarders.<br /><br />#3 - Sure
    you could do it, but it would be way more complex than what QFabric does. They
    hide the complexity of the underlying mechanisms (which are probably not too different
    from what you&#39;re describing) in the same way TRILL/OTV/802.1aq is hiding all
    the complexity of IS-IS.'

  html: Well, still in theory, it would be possible to filter that traffic (mac, arp),
    wouldn&#39;t it ?

  html: In theory it might be possible ;) Or, as someone famously said once &quot;looking
    at the code I couldn&#39;t see why it wouldn&#39;t work&quot;  :-P

  html: 'Regarding #2... Optimal forwarding != shortest path, IMHO. I would like to
    understand what hashing algorithm is used within QFabric to determine the flow
    within the system. It&#39;s not clear whether ECMP is supported, load-sharing
    etc.<br /><br />Regarding #3... With regards to troubleshooting, I am not sure
    whether it&#39;s more complex to analyze a set of standard, published protocols
    than to troubleshoot a proprietary black-box. I will need to see QFabric more
    in detail to see what troubleshooting tools are we given in order to understand
    the involved mechanisms.'

  html: Hello, Ivan!<br />As far as I understand the one-lookup philosophy means that
    all nodes have the same forwarding tables. What the reason to devide QFX&#39;s
    into ServerNodeGroup/NetworkNodeGroup and to make the restriction for NetworkNodeGroup
    for only eight node devices?

  html: 'Control plane scalability. You can&#39;t interact with too many neighbors
    from a single point.<br /><br />QFabric control plane is just like a regular network
    (best example might be BGP with route reflectors):  each node group interacts
    with directly attached neighbors, and they exchange the routing information through
    a set of central nodes.'
