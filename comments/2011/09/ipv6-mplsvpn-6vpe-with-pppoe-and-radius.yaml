  html: Have you ever run into a situation where an IPv6 connected route for the peer
    is not installed on the PPPoE client/CE? I have to manually add a static route
    pointing at the Dialer to establish connectivity (which is not ideal).<br /><br
    />This is on a 7206 VXR, the PE is running 12.2(33)SRE8, the CE is running 15.1(4)M6.
