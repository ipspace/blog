  html: So you also disagree with VPLS? It seems to me that functionally, TRILL over
    a WAN is VPLS without an MPLS forwarding plane.

  html: Not even close. VPLS supports numerous broadcast domains, TRILL only one.
    But it&#39;s a very valid question, will write a blog post about it.<br /><br
    />Oh, and incidentally, I also disagree with lots of VPLS use cases ;) It only
    makes sense as a vehicle providing end-to-end L2 transport in SP environment with
    routers around it.

  html: I was looking at TRILL vs VPLS from the users point of view, and that&#39;s
    where I think functionally they&#39;re no different.<br /><br />I&#39;ll admit
    that I haven&#39;t read it yet, however the following is the original paper that
    inspired the TRILL effort, which probably should be an input into your blog post
    -<br /><br />http://www.ieee-infocom.org/2004/Papers/26_1.PDF<br /><br />Due to
    the author&#39;s reputation and achievements in the field, I&#39;d be willing
    to put some weight on her judgements about whether it is wise or not to extend
    TRILL across the WAN ;-) The 2nd edition of her book also touches on some of these
    subjects.<br /><br />It seems to me that there would be two objects to running
    TRILL across the WAN -<br /><br />* broadcast domain size<br />* flat routing
    (i.e. lack of address aggregation)<br /><br />They&#39;re reasonable concerns,
    however as always, it is a trade off. Today&#39;s WANs pretty much have the same
    broadcast, multicast and unicast characteristics as the 1990s LANs, so 1990s LAN
    protocols and LAN designs would be applicable to today&#39;s WANs in a lot of
    cases. I remember one of those rules being &quot;switch where you can, route where
    you must&quot;, due to the cost and performance differences between forwarding
    at layer 2 and layer 3. Those cost concerns still apply.

  html: As you quote Radia Perlman, you might as well listen to her TRILL talk on
    YouTube where she explains how unhappy she was with the whole bridging idea.<br
    /><br />Next, the &quot;bridge where you can, route where you must&quot; recommendation
    was made in days when:<br /><br />A) routing was done in SW and some bridging
    was done in HW<br />B) routers were multi-protocol beasts<br />C) routing was
    complex and bridging was simple.<br /><br />TRILL is no simpler than IP routing,
    L2 and L3 switching work at wire speed, and those claims were usually made by
    people who didn&#39;t want to invest into routing software.<br /><br />On a WAN
    link, there is minor cost or performance difference if you do bridging or routing
    correctly ... at least if your WAN bandwidth is a small percentage of your LAN
    bandwidth, in which case bridging over WAN will kill you as surely as it did those
    idiots that tried to use it over 64 kbps links.
