  html: Unless they developed something new, it falls under &quot;two-box MLAG solutions
    from other vendors&quot;. Will mention it (and ALU) together with vPC during the
    presentation.<br /><br />The coverage in the webinar will be more extensive, but
    I need some help - at least point me to a recent set of documentation, I can take
    it from there.

  html: Thanks for the link. Seems they made decent progress, SMLT is now functionally
    (almost) identical to vPC, the only difference might be active-active HSRP support
    in NX-OS (I understood the documents saying that with SMLT only one switch forwards
    off-subnet traffic through VRRP address).
