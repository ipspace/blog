  html: Pretty cool Ivan.<br />If your ToR switches are L3, running BGP, you could
    use a similar technique to gracefully take a Spine switch out of service for maintenance,
    or other problems.  Just log in to the Spine switch and shutdown the Loopback
    interface that would trigger BGP to remove route advertisements to the ToR switches.  The
    ToR move the flows to another Spine switch, at which point you can begin your
    maintenance.  RIght?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Brad

  html: How about looking at PfR for this? <br /><br />Thanks,<br />Andy

  html: Pick 4 less than /22 prefixes from 4 different continents and then match them
    in a route map so that they are ANDed.<br /><br />Basically, if all 4 are down
    then you could responsibly say that your connectivity to Internet has some huge
    problem and should recall the default route.

  html: You just proved there&#39;s always a simpler way ;) Thank you! <br /><br />Sometimes
    I forget to step back and look at the bigger picture.

    html: Something more fundamental and well-known like anycasted root nameservers
      should work well for this though, shouldn&#39;t it? Those are already very nearly
      hardwired in some software (e.g. local DNS resolvers), and so should rarely
      change.

  html: Last year I worked on a internet service outage problem for a client.  Their
    load balancers had an &quot;internet health&quot; criteria as a part of providing
    the load-balanced services.  The check involved pinging well-known internet services
    that would &quot;never go down&quot;:<br />- altavista<br />- friendster<br />-
    kozmo.com<br />- pets.com<br /><br />I betcha can guess what went wrong...<br
    /><br />Relying on specific prefixes that I don&#39;t control seems risky for
    the same reasons.  They could get deaggregated, and I&#39;d never know until the
    last one went offline.<br /><br />BGP table size, presence of AS-paths longer
    than 3 hops, and presence of well-known ASes all seem like safer long-term, zero-maintenance
    schemes.

  html: I used to put 4/8 and 12/8 as anchors for default and filter everything else.
    Maybe some ASs for traffic engineering. It works as it should, ATT and L3 must
    see everybody on Internet being Tier-1s.<br />I don&#39;t like 0/0 walking inside
    ISP so each iBGP peer had 2 statics 0/0 -&gt; 4/8 and -&gt;12/8. And for even
    better safety last resort on borders poining to connected ebgp peers.<br />Never
    failed.<br />If both these T1s go offline you may safely change IT industry for
    new opportunities.

  html: "Hi,<br /><br />regarding this comment:<br /><br />&quot;The catch is in the\
    \ \u201Cmatch in the IP routing table\u201D part \u2013 you cannot use any of\
    \ the BGP attributes as matching criteria in the route map.&quot;<br /><br />Well,\
    \ you can use BGP attibutes as long as you match an ip prefix in the routing table.\
    \ So, Ip prefix in the routing table AND BGP Attribute will work. By the way,\
    \ running some tests I found out something interesting:<br /><br />- An Ip prefix,\
    \ 1.0.0.0/8, is generated by two different routers in different AS&#39;es (lets\
    \ say AS 1 and AS 2) . The eBGP neighbor of those is advertising the default conditionally\
    \ as long as it receives the 1.0.0.0/8 from AS 1. So, it generates the default\
    \ just in case it receives it from AS 1 and it works. If we receive it from AS\
    \ 2, it will not be generated.<br /><br />However, if we create a static route\
    \ 1.0.0.0/8 pointing to null 0, it generates the default route, even though is\
    \ local and obviously is not receiving it from AS 1. But, if you add a sentence\
    \ matching the next hop of the eBGP neighbor (AS 1) in the route-map, it will\
    \ not generate the default. So, it seems that it checks the routing table first\
    \ and then, if there is a valid match, it checks the Local BGP Table.<br /><br\
    \ />Hope this helps,<br />Jose."

  html: So the configuration that I have, where I match a prefix, and its next-hop
    attribute, is just matching the prefix? <br /><br />It appears to be working on
    a foundry I have (knock on wood), but I&#39;m definitely headed back to the lab.

  html: Track 8.8.8.8, 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220.  Then use &#39;bool&#39;
    in your sla tracking.
