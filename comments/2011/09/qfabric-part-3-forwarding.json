      "html": "I have a few questions. I have read your post now like five times and I am for sure speaking above my pay grade so maybe you can clear this up for me.<br /><br />1) One lookup per packet.<br />This sounds great, but the interconnect cant just forward frames based on nothing. It will still have to use something to determine which node to send the frame to...be it a label slapped on the front of the frame or something else. Since forwarding decisions are made in hardware how does QFabric add anything to this area? In theoretical application how does this differ from MPLS?<br /><br />2) Shared default router MAC address.<br />You assume we&#39;re doing L3 routing at the access layer. If we&#39;re doing routing at the distribution layer this is taken care of. Yes we still have traffic trombones, but if you want to go the traffic trombone route the only way I see QFabric could help with this is if you had a QFabric split between two datacenters. I&#39;m not even sure they would support that design. So if we assume we have two QFabric deployments in two different datacenters we&#39;re back to the same design challenges we face today.<br /><br />3) L2/L3 Same Path<br />I like this...but if we&#39;re routing at the access Layer why not use MPLS and set up VPLS? Would this not accomplish the same thing? I think I just made the biggest traffic trombone in the world, but if I am accurate then I am sure smart engineers at Cisco, Brocade, or HP could come up with a way to have each access switch act as the default route for hosts hanging off of it. Obviously this would need to include the distribution layer so it knows which access switch to forward to.<br /><br />Can someone break this down for me?",

ARP might even work, but you would get repeated ARP requests from various switches as the VM moves around.",

      "html": "#1 - they need some labeling scheme in the fabric, similar (in concept) to MPLS/VPN. The ingress node has to indicate egress interface with the label.<br /><br />#2 - You&#39;re absolutely right. You get optimal forwarding within the QFabric, not between QFabric and external L3 forwarders.<br /><br />#3 - Sure you could do it, but it would be way more complex than what QFabric does. They hide the complexity of the underlying mechanisms (which are probably not too different from what you&#39;re describing) in the same way TRILL/OTV/802.1aq is hiding all the complexity of IS-IS.",

It&#39;s not clear whether ECMP is supported, load-sharing etc.<br /><br />Regarding #3... With regards to troubleshooting, I am not sure whether it&#39;s more complex to analyze a set of standard, published protocols than to troubleshoot a proprietary black-box. I will need to see QFabric more in detail to see what troubleshooting tools are we given in order to understand the involved mechanisms.",
