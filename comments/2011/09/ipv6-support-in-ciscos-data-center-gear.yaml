  html: Cisco 3560/3750 can&#39;t do HSRP v6 and v4 on the same device. It is only

  html: And they wonder why the adopting rate of IPv6 is so slow. It&#39;s because
    the supported technology rate is so slow!

  html: Does UCS Express support IPv6? Since it is based on ISR Gen2 possibly since
    the 15x code supports IPv6 and if the server modules support win 2008(IPv6) will
    it work in its VM? Just curious if anyone has tried this yet.

    HSRP for IPv4 but use IPv6 NDP to set the router preference with tuned RAs default
    router preference and lifetime for the same results? Or neighbor unreachability/dead
    gateway detection with Ipv6 icmp redirects for local router only?

  html: The RA-based failover is probably not fast enough. Based on configuration
    guide it seems that the minimum RA interval you can set is 3 seconds and RA lifetime
    has to be at least twice the RA interval (or a single lost RA packet might cause
    problems).<br /><br />Is 8-10 seconds good enough for you? Tweak RA timers. Less
    than that? Use NHRP.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Part of enterprise DC could also wireless thing like WCS
    which support IPv6 this way --&gt; (from doc) Always set to &quot;1&quot; because
    WCS only supports ipv4 addresses.<br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/wireless/wcs/7.0/configuration/guide/7_0admin.html<br
    />I`m not able found anything Cisco Prime and IPV6.<br /><br />and if customer
    using WLC as anchor (DMZ) for internet access --&gt; then only IPv6 pass-through
    is available http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/wireless/controller/7.0/configuration/guide/c70ovrv.html<br
    /><br />you have most updates base on datasheet, which could not working properly.  <br
    />I like RIPE methodology. They sorted base on vendor claimant or confirmed by
    users.<br />http://labs.ripe.net/Members/mirjam/ipv6-cpe-survey-updated-january-2011

  html: ME3600X:<br />IPv6 to be released 2011/2012 from what I was told from Cisco
    earlier this year. <br />MPLS VPN IPv6 (VPNv6) will be later next year according
    to what I read in a Blog somewhere.
