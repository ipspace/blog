  html: 'Ivan,<br /><br />I&#39;m glad to see a post about wireless. I hope this piques
    readers&#39; interest in wireless provider&#39;s packet core networks. These providers
    stand to benefit from engineers with backgrounds working on large ISPs. Folks
    who have this experience know how to move bits at extremely large scale, and this
    knowledge is vital as the mobile Internet continues to add new devices and consume
    bandwidth.<br /><br />If readers want to learn more about the 3GPP packet core,
    I recommend buying EPC and 4G Packet Networks: Driving the Mobile Broadband Revolution
    by Magnus Olsson. The books focuses on the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), the 3GPP
    Release-8 and beyond packet core. There is some information about pre-Release-8
    packet cores; however, the material mostly concerns interoperability. There are
    many good books out there on GPRS/WCDMA for readers who want to understand the
    previous packet core architecture.<br /><br />Jeff L.'
