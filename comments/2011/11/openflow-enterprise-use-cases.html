            <div class="comment-content">The bottom line is there are similarities between OpenFlow and CAPWAP (used for communication between wireless access points and WLAN controllers).  The analogy isn&#39;t used enough.  Cisco sold hard against a centralized WLAN years ago, then the next thing you know, they buy Airespace and offer both models of centralized (using non standard LWAPP) and IOS de-centralized (IOS) Access Points.  Now, even with the controller model, one can run HREAP per SSID.  For the data plane, you choose which traffic stays local to the LAN switch or which traffic is tunneled back to the controller.  Control plane traffic always comes back to the controller.  With all that being said, who had every killer app for wireless when Airespace came onto the scene?  No one.  It was for the simplification of deployment and management AFAIK, but now with all of this data being collected in a central location now, we have applications such as location tracking, enhanced wireless IPS, integration with RFID tools, etc. and then it allowed for a focal point to implement policy, be it ACLs, NAC, etc. &lt;--- one design where NAC is &quot;easy&quot; to deploy.<br /><br />Another point is that CAPWAP was developed so there was an IEEE standard protocol for communication between APs and controllers vs. Cisco LWAPP.  Now, without knowing all the details, who&#39;s ever tested/deployed an Aruba AP working with a Cisco controller, or vice versa?  They are both running the same IEEE protocol, right?  Why will OF (or any interface) change that?  One protocol, one solution...Would WLAN benefit from OF being used instead of CAPWAP?  I don&#39;t know :)  seems to make sense.<br /><br />I do agree NAC/security may just be the killer app...in addition to simplified management and day 2 operations.</div>
