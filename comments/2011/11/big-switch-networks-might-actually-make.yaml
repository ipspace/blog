  html: Ivan, agree with you 100%.  I for one would be the macho type...and use the
    CLI!  There have been many folks (I think you included in prior posts) out there
    over the past several months state you will probably not see anything you can&#39;t
    already do today within an OF network.  Not talking about SDN apps on top.  However,
    this is def a great example of OPERATIONAL benefits that can be realized by using
    a controller based OF model  Really look forward to seeing this stuff in action
    one day too.

  html: brings up the debate about keeping the network decentralized in control plane
    operation in the classical sense of routing protocol PHB FSMs to handling things
    but give the perception of one box. Vs. the centralized controller approach to
    achieve the same thing. Both have their merits and demerits a fat finger on one
    PH device may affect a part of the decentralized but a fat finger on the controller
    could affect the whole virtual presented core &quot;box&quot;. Just being &quot;conceptual&quot;
    here today. Warm in NY.

  html: don&#39;t we see &quot;pieces&quot; of this  with LISP and PER with their
    &quot;controller&quot; like function?

  html: Not sure what &quot;PER&quot; is (pointers?), LISP is a completely different
    beast. Similar forwarding principles (there&#39;s nothing new under the sun since
    X.25 days), but definitely not the management/control plane perspective.
