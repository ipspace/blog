      "html": "Certainly an interesting take on an old problem!<br /><br />Simplest solution I can think of isn&#39;t an IPv6 solution at all - wireless client isolation. A lot of APs/controllers support it and it simply prevents traffic from one wireless client being forwarded by the AP back out to another. Really should be turned on in public access locations for this and other more obvious reasons.",

I am turning the knobs on IPv6 protocol(s) on a v6 research project I am on. I know of the DHCP man in the middle but what about the possibility of a dhcp v6 lease queary/response from dhcp server to local (dhcp relay)edge router(router) exploit - poisoning or changing the lease?<br /><br />The IP tables for v6 is great didn&#39;t even consider that one from the UNIX side.",

      "html": "FYI Cisco lightweight wireless currently does IPv6 really, really badly. There are a few issues, but chief amongst them are NO FILTERING AT ALL - no RA guard, no access lists, no nothing. This means that a rogue router can cause complete havoc. This is more common than you might think, because Microsoft Internet Connection Sharing in Vista/Windows 7 is an IPv6 router, and will advertise itself as such - even when the windows machine has only one network interface up!<br /><br />It&#39;s also worth noting that vlan assignment doesn&#39;t work with IPv6 - it only affects IPv4<br /><br />The only way to even disable IPv6 on these things is to disable layer2 multicasts. This of course breaks IPv4 multicast, but does at least stop IPv6 working.<br /><br />Apparently this is unfixable in the 1st gen controllers / wisms. You need 5500/wism2 and a new software image (that we are promised &quot;soon&quot;) which will support full IPv6 parity, including RA guard (a later image will support LWAPP over IPv6, if you care)",
