  html: As a matter of fact, in my J-series routers (and also with Olive, JUNOS 10.4R1.9)
    I am able to start LDP session without specifying any interfaces under the [protocols
    mpls] stanza, even if in all JUNOS documents you find that you have to enable
    interfaces inside  [protocols mpls] also. <br />What I find is that if you wanto
    to setup an MPLS-TE VC you need to enable interfaces under  [protocols mpls] (and
    under  [protocols rsvp] also !), but not for LDP (at least in real J-series routers,
    and Olive) . <br />Frankly, from a conceptual point of view,  I do not understand
    the need to specify interfaces under  [protocols mpls] also when you want to enable
    LDP. LDP Hello messages start as soon as you commit configuration after enabling
    interfaces under  [protocols ldp], and that is enough to start LDP sessions. I
    do not whether I am missing some points, but so far all LDP related configurations
    I made work fine.

  html: I have a kind request to all people partecipating to this blog. I am surely
    an old-fashioned guy so I do not have any Facebook or Twitter accounts (I prefer
    climbing mountains instead of wasting my free time in front a &quot;cold&quot;
    PC).<br /><br />Could you please avoid to use Twitter to post your interesting
    comments ? Thanks a lot.

  html: I got LDP/MPLS up and running without listing the interfaces in [protocols
    mpls], but had to specify &quot;family mpls&quot; under [interfaces]. Not sure
    whether that&#39;s connected with the need to specify &quot;transport-address&quot;
    within [protocols ldp] or not.

  html: No, the &quot;family mpls&quot; under [edit interfaces name-interface.unit]
    is needed since Juniper touters interfaces by default accept IPv4 packets only.
    Adding &quot;family mpls&quot; instructs the router to accept packet from other
    protocols also. For instance, if you want an interface accept IPv6 packets you
    must add &quot;family inet6&quot;, for IS-IS messages you must include &quot;family
    iso&quot;, and so forth.<br />But for whatever reason, if you forget to enable
    &quot;family mpls&quot; on an interface, on that interface you cannot have any
    LDP sessions, even if an LDP session does not require to be set up any MPLS packet.
    Probably the idea is that if you set up an LDP session on an interfacce, sometime
    in the future that interface will receive MPLS packets.<br />Concerning &quot;transport-address&quot;
    you have to be very careful, since by default JUNOS uses as RID for every protocols
    (OSPF, BGP, LDP) the IP address configured under [routing-options] stanza. While
    for BGP and OSPF this address may be arbitrary (even unreachable, or totally invented)
    for LDP it must be L3-reachable since it is used by default for the TCP connection.
    So the best-practice I use is to define the router-id equal to the loopback interface
    address.<br />This is different from IOS, where you can define different RID for
    each protocol. As a matter of fact, I use the same best prectice in Cisco IOS
    also. I usually define the RID of each protocol equal to the IP address of the
    Loopback 0 interface (and of course I advertise this interface in IGP !)

  html: JunOS doesn&#39;t tie MPLS to LDP like Cisco does. RSVP is given equal footing
    in their label distribution protocols.

  html: '| Reload might have helped ;)<br /><br />You&#39;re just begging for the
    JunOS fanboy trolls to come in, aren&#39;t you? :)<br /><br />On a more serious
    note, thank you for clearing up some of the issues I was having.. expecting IOS
    behavior out of a Juniper router is hardly normal, but I had my own concerns with
    getting things functioning 100/100.'

  html: Actually, I managed to totally confuse Junos (or shall I say JunOS to feed
    the trolls ;) ) a few times during the last days. A perfectly legal configuration
    that I couldn&#39;t possibly make to work ... until after a reload. <br /><br
    />I&#39;m positive it&#39;s just me, the negative energy I&#39;m emitting, and
    my grumpy attitude.

    think I&#39;ve just been sold on never even considering Junos switches and routers.

    is hidden keyword, but it forces complete rebuild of config internal to routing-engine...
    fixes things sometimes.

  html: The Junos way makes a lot more sense. LDP is a protocol and should therefore
    be under protocols. Just like with OSPF - configuring OSPF information on the
    interface like newer-IOS makes no sense... it&#39;s not an interface configuration,
    its a protocol.

    You have to specify family inet for that to happen.

    html: In theory, yes. In practice, I don&#39;t think so.<br /><br />The _huge_
      difference, however, is that Junos assigns labels to /32s (loopbacks) whereas
      Cisco IOS assigns labels to all non-BGP prefixes.
