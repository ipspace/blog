  html: Do you think you can post all the blog text to RSS and Kindle?  It sounds
    ridiculous but have to hit the Read More... link in kindle and android isn&#39;t
    a good user experience.   Thanks.

  html: I like the new domain choice. <br /><br />The only small detail that could
    be better, but I guess it would not work with the logo, would be to keep IP in
    uppercase.<br /><br />Anyway details, the content is what really matters  ;)

  html: Putting the full text in the RSS feed hurts pageviews that don&#39;t reach
    the original site, therefore most bloggers, that care about pageviews, only put
    a snippet of the entire post. <br /><br />If you use a feed aggregator, yes it
    would be great to have all the information right there, but if you are really
    interested in the post content you will click the &#39;more&#39; link.
