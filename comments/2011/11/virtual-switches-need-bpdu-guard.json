BPDU guard functionality doesn&#39;t imply just dropping the BDPUs, it also implies shutting down the virtual port of the vSwitch connected to that VM. <br /><br />The primary use case is that virtual machines are not Ethernet bridges, so the current implementation works well for the common use case. However, where there are advanced use cases like this where VM is a bridge running STP - the admin has to do a little more, like either disable bridge code in Windows via registry (too complex and doesn&#39;t work in Cloud environments since management can be delegated but viable in non-Cloud use cases) or use products from VMware and partners to drop the BPDUs. For example, vShield App has a L2 firewall capability - you can drop all BPDUs sent by VMs at will with a point of enforcement being on every vNIC of VMs on the ESX host. If you do that, you have to create a loopfree topology. <br /><br />Will VMware do something interesting in vSwitch top to address this? Stay tuned, Ivan would be the first to know :-)",

      "html": "Hi Folks, played around in the lab today, here is a workaround: <br />I&#39;d recommend configuring BPDU-filter and disable BPDU-guard on the upstream switch. In order to retain the portfast mode for the ports facing the ESX, it\u2019s also important to set these parameters on a per switch port basis \u2013 not globally, which has the behavior of moving the switch port out of portfast mode once a BPDU is received\u2026 <br /><br />Carlos and I did some testing on a 6506 w/ fairly recent IOS code: <br /><br />PRME-BL-6506-J06#show run interface g1/31<br />Building configuration...<br /><br />Current configuration : 178 bytes<br />!<br />interface GigabitEthernet1/31<br />switchport<br />switchport mode access<br />no ip address<br />spanning-tree portfast  \uf0df<br />spanning-tree bpdufilter enable  \uf0df<br />spanning-tree bpduguard disable  \uf0df<br />end<br /><br />Before doing this, we\u2019d see the BPDU guard kick in: <br /><br />PRME-BL-6506-J06#show log | i 1/31<br />6w2d: %SPANTREE-SP-2-BLOCK_BPDUGUARD: Received BPDU on port GigabitEthernet1/31 with BPDU Guard enabled. Disabling port.<br />6w2d: %PM-SP-4-ERR_DISABLE: bpduguard error detected on Gi1/31, putting Gi1/31 in err-disable state<br />PRME-BL-6506-J06#<br /><br />Then we went to the configuration show above w/ portfast enabled, filter enabled, guard disabled and the port moved from blocking to forwarding as per portfast definition and BDPU counters are at zero\u2026 The key thing is to do this on a per-port basis and not globally. <br /><br />PRME-BL-6506-J06#show spanning-tree int g1/31 portfast<br />VLAN0001         enabled<br /><br /><br />PRME-BL-6506-J06#show spanning-tree int g1/31 detail<br />Port 31 (GigabitEthernet1/31) of VLAN0001 is forwarding<br />   Port path cost 4, Port priority 128, Port Identifier 128.31.<br />   Designated root has priority 0, address 0004.961e.6f70<br />   Designated bridge has priority 32769, address 0007.8478.8c00<br />   Designated port id is 128.31, designated path cost 14<br />   Timers: message age 0, forward delay 0, hold 0<br />   Number of transitions to forwarding state: 1<br />   The port is in the portfast mode<br />   Link type is point-to-point by default<br />   Bpdu filter is enabled<br />   BPDU: sent 0, received 0",

      "html": "BPDUfilter, only when enabled globally, can prevent BPDUguard from triggering if a user/customer bridges two vNICs in ESX.<br /><br />Assumption: vSwitch truly provides loop-free forwarding as Ivan has mentioned/proven in other blog posts. (with the prevent forged option enabled)<br /><br />BPDUfiltering, enabled globally, filters outbound BPDUs on all portfast/edge ports. It also sends &quot;a few&quot; at link up to prevent STP race conditions and an ugly loop as a result. If it does receive BPDUs, it causes the port to fall out of portfast/edge mode.<br /><br />So, if a vNIC in ESX is bridged, the BPDUs never leave the pSwitch after the initial linkup to cause them to loop around in the vSwitch and reflected back to the pSwitch. This way, you get the following benefits:<br /><br />a) One bad VM won&#39;t trigger BPDUguard, thereby isolating a hypervisor (or a cluster in Ivan&#39;s example)<br />b) A miscabled host attached to a pSwitch port will fall out of portfast mode if BPDUs are seen from it. Protecting you from a bad sysadmin/cable-job with a non-loopfree (non vSwitch) looping the network.<br /><br /><br />Basically, enabling BPDUfilter globally circumvents Ivan&#39;s concern in the above blog about a non-ESXi being plugged into the network causing a loop. If one of these does get plugged in and has a loop, the switch will see the BPDUs at link up and move the ports out of portfast/edge.<br /><br />The only situation where this breaks down is a non-ESX hypervisor that has a vswitch that does not guarantee loop-free. In this situation, the pSwitch sees the uplinks as up and online, so no BPDUs have been sent in awhile, so a loop in the non-ESX vSwitch could be a devastating take down of your datacenter. Then, I&#39;m afraid, storm-control is your only friend.<br /><br />Outside of my Virtual-facing pSwitches, I would never do BPDUfilter, even globally....BPDUguard is a must for the rest of my network.",
