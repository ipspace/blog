      "html": "Ivan,<br /><br />I agree with the original complaint - that consistency checker takes out VPCs. My gripe is how quick the checker works.  If I want to modify the MTU on a 5K pair with back to back VPC then I need out of band access to the switch, which most do not have because it seems to make more sense to uplink 5K pairs direct instead of through an out of band management network considering they are copper.  It&#39;s so quick that even the multi-send technique of secureCRT does not work.  At least give me 10 seconds!!!!<br /><br />The consistency checker makes anyone fear god to make even the smallest changes without standing right in front of the 7K or the 5K.  Who, still, doesnt get a little scared every time &lt;vlan&gt; scrolls the buffer every time you create one?<br /><br />I went ahead and spent quite a bit of money on console servers, which i really never felt i needed in the past for access switches, because of consistency checker.&lt;/vlan&gt;",
