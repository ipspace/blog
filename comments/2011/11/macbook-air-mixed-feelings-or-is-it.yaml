  html: 'A few comments: <br /><br />Regarding keyboard layouts - you can create your
    own with this: http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;id=ukelele<br
    /><br />Regarding spellcheck, MS apps will use their own dictionaries last I checked,
    so any fix that works for the rest of the system isn&#39;t likely to work in them.
    <br /><br />Regarding keyboard shortcuts, have you tried a tool like Quicksilver
    to give the Mac global keystrokes and launching?  Makes trips to the mouse much
    more rare: http://qsapp.com/<br /><br />Outlook for Mac is a 1.0 product at this
    point, and is somewhat rough around the edges - many PC to Mac switchers I&#39;ve
    worked with have expressed inadequacies with it.  Importing a PST converts it
    to discreet file/item so you&#39;re not getting file format level lock-in.'

  html: First of all, thank you for not telling me I&#39;m a moron ;)<br /><br />Will
    definitely try to figure out what I can do with keyboard layouts and shortcuts
    - these are the major issues so far (as I said, I can get used to most other things).<br
    /><br />As for spellchecking - the default language of the new text you type into
    most Office apps is inherited from the system settings, so if I type using Slovenian
    keyboard, Word assumes I&#39;m typing in Slovenian (Chrome, for example, uses
    English spell checker regardless of keyboard layout ... hold on, there&#39;s a
    thought ... maybe yet another Word option ;) )

  html: 'Pipi, resist. When I got my first MacBook I was totally lost and I know I&#39;m
    more on the side that actually does things and not designer. <br /><br />After
    some time I got used to it and started to use new shortcuts and all the new movements
    that I never got before. <br /><br />Some year ago my MacBook died and I had to
    use PS with windows (because of lid-closing and sleep failures of Linux at that
    hardware). It was a horror, hell freezed over for me. Half of the time I had to
    wait for windows to reflect on something, everytime I opened the lid there was
    several minutes of waiting and if not that I spent considerable amount of time
    fixing windows. Not to say that I was totally lost with shortcuts and movement,
    that I forgot with pleasure.<br /><br />After 5 weeks I got my new MacBook Air
    (wanted 4GB of ram and that is &quot;built to order&quot; and with that I got
    my life back and was able again to do some work in time. <br /><br />Takeaway
    from the story: You use what you have, when you get used to something better and
    more usefull it&#39;s hard to go back, because you just imagine all the time how
    would your original system work. <br /><br />Resist, get used to it (a month or
    two), explore, ask friends for useful tricks, use them and you&#39;ll be good
    :)'

    is due to the SSD, not the OS.

  html: Ivan, you can set up your own shortcuts for most menu items in individual
    programs.<br /><br />Go to System Prefs -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; Keyboard Shortcuts
    -&gt; Application Shortcuts -&gt; &quot;+&quot; (or start typing word &quot;shortcuts&quot;
    in Search box on Systems Prefs panel)

  html: In my experience, running Office for Windows in a Win7 VM results in a more
    useful setup than trying to use Office Mac. I am unimpressed with all parts of
    Mac Office, but Mac Outlook deserves an award for unimpressiveness.

  html: I can understand some of your pain. I am from Germany, and one thing made
    my move to my first Mac, which was an iBook, easier than for others. I had already
    switched to US keyboard layouts on my PCs, simply because all those characters
    you need for programming languages were difficult to reach with the German layout.<br
    />So, when I made the switch to Mac, I ordered my iBook from Apple with an US
    keyboard. This spared me the move from German PC layout to German Mac layout,
    which differ a lot.<br /><br />What I love about Mac OS X is the built-in Tftp
    server. And should you need a terminal emulaion, just use screen.<br /><br />I
    cant say anything abou Microsoft Office, as we are an OpenOffice/Libreoffice shop.

  html: A while ago, I wrote a compact overview of my switching experience (about
    3 years ago), including things I still miss from Windows, things that just took
    some time adapting too, and things from OSX that I now miss on my work Windows
    7 laptop.<br />Perhaps, you find it interesting.<br />http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/23798/what-will-i-miss-from-windows/23956#23956

  html: If the keybindings bug you, I&#39;d strongly suggest checking out KeyRemap4MacBook:<br
    /><br />http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/<br /><br />You can do a lot to
    get the keyboard layout you want with this, perhaps even getting the right mix
    and match of English+Slovenian use that you desire.  And, if there&#39;s some
    configurations of general interest to Slovenian users, the developer will probably
    add it -- seems pretty responsive.<br /><br />There&#39;s a similarly-powerful
    took for configuring trackpad behavior called:<br /><br />http://www.bettertouchtool.net/<br
    /><br />But I don&#39;t have as much experience with it.  <br /><br />Also, for
    the person who recommended iTerm, specifically you want iTerm2:<br /><br />http://code.google.com/p/iterm2/<br
    /><br />AFAICT, there&#39;s no lack of keyboard shortcuts for MacOS.  In some
    cases, there&#39;s a surplus of them to compensate for the one-button mouse.  The
    problem is in their poor documentation and inconsistency across applications.    <br
    /><br />And yeah, the OA situation on MacOS mostly sucks.  VMWare Fusion is a
    godsend in that department.

  html: You have the makings here of a good &quot;I am a PC&quot; &quot;I am a MAC&quot;
    guy commercial. <br /><br />I am heading that way too. Taught myself to touch
    type 10 years ago for ccie lab but nowadays trying to keep up with all the shortcuts
    is a pain. The mouse &quot;intellie track&quot; not so intelligent IMO, is one
    of my biggest gripes too. Some laptops let you turn it off.  Same here with the
    old laptop etc. I figured eventually we should be able to take all of our data,
    cloud it(private) and no matter the device just have our virtual desktop for everything
    we need. (sans sniffers and spetrum analyzers etc). dependent on network pipe
    of course.

  html: Ivan, you may also want to take a look at Parallels Desktop, I personally
    prefer it over VMware on my MacBook. If you run Fusion just to have a Windows
    7 client on your laptop, I strongly suggest considering parallels.<br /><br />Admittedly,
    the MS Office on Mac is not as good as the Windows version and I know many ppl
    who actually run office over parallels (not that I like it though)<br /><br />One
    point that I personally like about Macbooks is that, from my experience, their
    LCDs have been by far superior.

  html: Ivan,<br />I am in the process of looking at a new Macbook and thought I&#39;d
    decided on a 15&quot; Macbook Pro.. there were a few sway points away from the
    Air that I could see; Unknown performance running virtual machines (I use Windows
    in Fusion for the odd thing) - how have you found it?  I know a lot of performance
    hits these days are down to the drive and having an SSD sorts a lot of this out.
    The other niggle for me [as a network engineer] was the lack of a built-in Ethernet
    port.  I love the portability of the Air but that Ethernet port is all-too-important
    I think..

  html: 'Haven&#39;t done any real performance testing, but the Fusion VM seems pretty
    fast (faster than my Windows box, but that&#39;s probably due to SSD drive).<br
    /><br />Ethernet port - here&#39;s a &quot;solution&quot;: http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MB442-USB-Ethernet-Adapter/dp/B0012P26ZO
    You can probably get it much cheaper, but it won&#39;t be in the &quot;just right&quot;
    color ;)'

    no VM&#39;s or Microshaft products installed. Just bought it so for sure not my
    primary PC. I don&#39;t pick it up all the time yet...  but love when I do  8-)
