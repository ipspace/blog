LDP Hello messages start as soon as you commit configuration after enabling interfaces under  [protocols ldp], and that is enough to start LDP sessions. I do not whether I am missing some points, but so far all LDP related configurations I made work fine.",

      "html": "No, the &quot;family mpls&quot; under [edit interfaces name-interface.unit] is needed since Juniper touters interfaces by default accept IPv4 packets only. Adding &quot;family mpls&quot; instructs the router to accept packet from other protocols also. For instance, if you want an interface accept IPv6 packets you must add &quot;family inet6&quot;, for IS-IS messages you must include &quot;family iso&quot;, and so forth.<br />But for whatever reason, if you forget to enable &quot;family mpls&quot; on an interface, on that interface you cannot have any LDP sessions, even if an LDP session does not require to be set up any MPLS packet. Probably the idea is that if you set up an LDP session on an interfacce, sometime in the future that interface will receive MPLS packets.<br />Concerning &quot;transport-address&quot; you have to be very careful, since by default JUNOS uses as RID for every protocols (OSPF, BGP, LDP) the IP address configured under [routing-options] stanza. While for BGP and OSPF this address may be arbitrary (even unreachable, or totally invented) for LDP it must be L3-reachable since it is used by default for the TCP connection. So the best-practice I use is to define the router-id equal to the loopback interface address.<br />This is different from IOS, where you can define different RID for each protocol. As a matter of fact, I use the same best prectice in Cisco IOS also. I usually define the RID of each protocol equal to the IP address of the Loopback 0 interface (and of course I advertise this interface in IGP !)",
