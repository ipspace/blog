Makes trips to the mouse much more rare: http://qsapp.com/<br /><br />Outlook for Mac is a 1.0 product at this point, and is somewhat rough around the edges - many PC to Mac switchers I&#39;ve worked with have expressed inadequacies with it.  Importing a PST converts it to discreet file/item so you&#39;re not getting file format level lock-in.",

When I got my first MacBook I was totally lost and I know I&#39;m more on the side that actually does things and not designer. <br /><br />After some time I got used to it and started to use new shortcuts and all the new movements that I never got before. <br /><br />Some year ago my MacBook died and I had to use PS with windows (because of lid-closing and sleep failures of Linux at that hardware). It was a horror, hell freezed over for me. Half of the time I had to wait for windows to reflect on something, everytime I opened the lid there was several minutes of waiting and if not that I spent considerable amount of time fixing windows. Not to say that I was totally lost with shortcuts and movement, that I forgot with pleasure.<br /><br />After 5 weeks I got my new MacBook Air (wanted 4GB of ram and that is &quot;built to order&quot; and with that I got my life back and was able again to do some work in time. <br /><br />Takeaway from the story: You use what you have, when you get used to something better and more usefull it&#39;s hard to go back, because you just imagine all the time how would your original system work. <br /><br />Resist, get used to it (a month or two), explore, ask friends for useful tricks, use them and you&#39;ll be good :)",

I had already switched to US keyboard layouts on my PCs, simply because all those characters you need for programming languages were difficult to reach with the German layout.<br />So, when I made the switch to Mac, I ordered my iBook from Apple with an US keyboard. This spared me the move from German PC layout to German Mac layout, which differ a lot.<br /><br />What I love about Mac OS X is the built-in Tftp server. And should you need a terminal emulaion, just use screen.<br /><br />I cant say anything abou Microsoft Office, as we are an OpenOffice/Libreoffice shop.",
