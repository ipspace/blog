  html: Certainly an interesting take on an old problem!<br /><br />Simplest solution
    I can think of isn&#39;t an IPv6 solution at all - wireless client isolation.
    A lot of APs/controllers support it and it simply prevents traffic from one wireless
    client being forwarded by the AP back out to another. Really should be turned
    on in public access locations for this and other more obvious reasons.

  html: Great post always an eye opener. For wireless one should consider turning
    off or to disable any P2P in the service set. As for the IPv6 nice reporting Ivan,
    great stuff as always. I am turning the knobs on IPv6 protocol(s) on a v6 research
    project I am on. I know of the DHCP man in the middle but what about the possibility
    of a dhcp v6 lease queary/response from dhcp server to local (dhcp relay)edge
    router(router) exploit - poisoning or changing the lease?<br /><br />The IP tables
    for v6 is great didn&#39;t even consider that one from the UNIX side.

  html: As always, if you have a monkey-in-the-middle (a great new term I just learnt
    from Randy Bush ;) listening to an unprotected protocol (like relayed DHCPv6),
    all bets are off.

  html: That nicely solves a single AP issue (thank you for the pointer, you just
    gave me a troubleshooting idea for my home WiFi), but you still have the same
    problem if you have multiple access points and an IPv6-clueless engineer configuring
    the backhaul network.

  html: If you combine it with carefully implemented private vlans on the switches
    (which is basically the same thing the APs are doing with client isolation), then
    you can extend to multiple access points. That gets hard on bigger networks, though,
    plus people do occasionally want to connect to each other on the same network.

    even close?  :-P

  html: Indeed, AP isolation is the easiest way to solve this IPv6-related problem
    as well as IPv4 rogue DHCPv4 &amp; ARP spoofing. Having done this &#39;test&#39;
    in a couple of hot spots, a (small) majority of hot spots do AP isolation.<br

  html: Some other VPN clients (AnyConnect) do the exact opposite in regards to IPv6.<br
    />They will cut off any local IPv6 connectivity regardless of whether the remote
    endpoint(asa) is configured to send/receive IPv6 traffic over the tunnel or not.<br
    />So basically if you&#39;re working in an IPv6 environment and start a VPN connection
    with AnyConncet to somewhere, the client will disconnect all your current IPv6
    sessions.<br />According to Cisco this is a &quot;feature not a bug&quot;.<br
    /><br />Good article. I also hadn&#39;t considered the ip6tables...

  html: A lot of these deployments use wireless controllers which tunnel traffic back
    between the AP and the controller over L3 networks allowing for exactly this kind
    of restriction across all APs (or alternatively the controller can tell APs to
    restrict the traffic to the controller without the L3 tunneling). This also means
    that the controller can then be used as the portal for guest access management
    (handling billing etc if needs be) without having to tag the guest VLAN across
    the entire LAN/WAN to each AP.

  html: wouldn&#39;t the anyconnect path use Teredo or 6to4 tunnel for IPv6? Ip in
    IP proto 41 encap(nat issues) or Teredo using IP udp IPv6 encap to get past nat.
    and the anyconnect tunnel may not even know. Of course your teredo needs to be
    set up.

  html: FYI Cisco lightweight wireless currently does IPv6 really, really badly. There
    are a few issues, but chief amongst them are NO FILTERING AT ALL - no RA guard,
    no access lists, no nothing. This means that a rogue router can cause complete
    havoc. This is more common than you might think, because Microsoft Internet Connection
    Sharing in Vista/Windows 7 is an IPv6 router, and will advertise itself as such
    - even when the windows machine has only one network interface up!<br /><br />It&#39;s
    also worth noting that vlan assignment doesn&#39;t work with IPv6 - it only affects
    IPv4<br /><br />The only way to even disable IPv6 on these things is to disable
    layer2 multicasts. This of course breaks IPv4 multicast, but does at least stop
    IPv6 working.<br /><br />Apparently this is unfixable in the 1st gen controllers
    / wisms. You need 5500/wism2 and a new software image (that we are promised &quot;soon&quot;)
    which will support full IPv6 parity, including RA guard (a later image will support
    LWAPP over IPv6, if you care)

  html: I would concur with Cisco knowingly implementing that (i.e. a feature).  In
    previous versions (2.x I think) IPv6 was still enabled when connecting to an IPv4
    only VPN.  It was great to be able to get to websites via IPv6 and avoid the draconian
    corporate filtering on the IPv4 VPN :)

  html: '&quot;FYI Cisco lightweight wireless currently does IPv6 really, really badly&quot;
    - cisco support only IPv6 pass-through mode which is by default disabled. They
    don`t rush add any IPv6 feature.<br /><br />I would expect that wireless client
