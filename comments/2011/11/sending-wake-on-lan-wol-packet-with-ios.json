      "html": "Static ARP entry vs. directed broadcast ACL?<br /><br />Ivan, I&#39;ve always enabled ip directed broadcast with an ACL permitting only systems that really need to send directed broadcasts.<br /><br />Is there a practical advantage to the static ARP approach?  The &quot;save processing on remote systems via IP filtering on the endpoint&quot; angle doesn&#39;t resonate with me because I trust the systems allowed by the ACL.<br /><br />If I should be re-evaluating my strategy I&#39;d like to know :-)",
