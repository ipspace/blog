      "html": "Welcome to the JUNOS world dear great Ivan. My opinion anyway is that switching from a technology (cisco) to another (Juniper, Huawei, ecc.) is easy if you have a deep knowledge of the protocols you want to work with. That&#39;s my experience, first theory, then practice. I don&#39;t know what you think about that.<br />I still do not know Junosphere (we have a lab with real J-series routers). It looks like a nice stuff, but for the beginners I think Olive will be enough, even if some functionalities, more or less advanced are missing, (NAT, L2VPN, ecc.).<br />By the way, if you download the &quot;JUNOS Advanced_IPv6_Config&quot;, you will find at page 18 the section &quot;Advertising IPv6 Routes Over IPv4 Sessions&quot;. Very clumsy configuration, but it seems to work !",

That&#39;s how Dynamips behaves (and that&#39;s people love it so much). Having a half-broken simulation that doesn&#39;t do features X, Y and Z always leave you wondering: is it me or the platform?<br /><br />IPv6-over-IPv4BGP: Got it up and running in 3 seconds. Cisco&#39;s implementation is way more complex as you can&#39;t configure ::ffff:a.b.c.d/128 on loopbacks.",

      "html": "The part I don&#39;t get here (and the same with Cisco IOU labs) is what the two vendors don&#39;t get about mind-share and charging for this stuff. Why not provide this sort of thing as a free VM one can run at home -- the CPU and memory burden are probably benign compared to Dynamips. The more skills and familiarity people have with the C or J product line, the more likely they are to recommend them. Particularly with Cisco, if they can get people started on certification, people can stay quite busy with just Cisco certs (which would preclude acquiring Juniper skills). And vice versa.",

Being brand new to JUNOS you&#39;re going to be stumbling around in the dark and to know that you will pay $5 per router even if you have 2-3 hours after work for a quick session has gotta hurt.<br /><br />A Juniper SRX is about $500-600 brand new.  Maybe it might make sense to do all your stumbling around on something like that and use JUNOSphere when you are simulating a deployment.<br /><br />Oh, BTW if Juniper insists on this why don&#39;t they take your payment/scheduling directly?  I don&#39;t think my company account representative wants to talk to me about $100.",
