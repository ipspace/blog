  html: Welcome to the JUNOS world dear great Ivan. My opinion anyway is that switching
    from a technology (cisco) to another (Juniper, Huawei, ecc.) is easy if you have
    a deep knowledge of the protocols you want to work with. That&#39;s my experience,
    first theory, then practice. I don&#39;t know what you think about that.<br />I
    still do not know Junosphere (we have a lab with real J-series routers). It looks
    like a nice stuff, but for the beginners I think Olive will be enough, even if
    some functionalities, more or less advanced are missing, (NAT, L2VPN, ecc.).<br
    />By the way, if you download the &quot;JUNOS Advanced_IPv6_Config&quot;, you
    will find at page 18 the section &quot;Advertising IPv6 Routes Over IPv4 Sessions&quot;.
    Very clumsy configuration, but it seems to work !

    /><br />Olive, Junosphere, Dynamips: it helps a lot if your simulated gear works
    as closely as possible to the real one (modulo queuing and a few other QoS features).
    That&#39;s how Dynamips behaves (and that&#39;s people love it so much). Having
    a half-broken simulation that doesn&#39;t do features X, Y and Z always leave
    you wondering: is it me or the platform?<br /><br />IPv6-over-IPv4BGP: Got it
    up and running in 3 seconds. Cisco&#39;s implementation is way more complex as
    you can&#39;t configure ::ffff:a.b.c.d/128 on loopbacks.'

  html: Spot on! I am interested to do SEC Track of Junos Certification but getting
    an affordable rack rental is impossible.Juniper must offer something similar to
    the lines of CLN.But i must say their Study guides are awesome.

  html: The part I don&#39;t get here (and the same with Cisco IOU labs) is what the
    two vendors don&#39;t get about mind-share and charging for this stuff. Why not
    provide this sort of thing as a free VM one can run at home -- the CPU and memory
    burden are probably benign compared to Dynamips. The more skills and familiarity
    people have with the C or J product line, the more likely they are to recommend
    them. Particularly with Cisco, if they can get people started on certification,
    people can stay quite busy with just Cisco certs (which would preclude acquiring
    Juniper skills). And vice versa.

  html: That&#39;s the part nobody outside of C&amp;J gets. Might have something to
    do with lawyers and/or the obsession to run everything as a profit center :-P

  html: Juniper charging per virtual router in the Junosphere must be a joke. Imagine
    if Microsoft made us pay for each concurrent word document opened.

  html: For someone who is gonna poke around JunOS for the first time, I don&#39;t
    think this makes much sense.  Being brand new to JUNOS you&#39;re going to be
    stumbling around in the dark and to know that you will pay $5 per router even
    if you have 2-3 hours after work for a quick session has gotta hurt.<br /><br
    />A Juniper SRX is about $500-600 brand new.  Maybe it might make sense to do
    all your stumbling around on something like that and use JUNOSphere when you are
    simulating a deployment.<br /><br />Oh, BTW if Juniper insists on this why don&#39;t
    they take your payment/scheduling directly?  I don&#39;t think my company account
    representative wants to talk to me about $100.

  html: Hi Ivan, Thanks for your posting those juniper. I&#39;m new to a juniper and
    i heard this junosphere. I got a basic know how of juniper. I&#39;d like to know
    how to setup a topoloogy on junos. Do you have a video or link how to setup a
    customize topology. <br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Ran

    topology from JNCIE  bootcamp? <br /><br />thanks.<br /><br />Randy

  html: Abner and Dan,<br /><br />It&#39;s been a long time since you posted this
    analysis of Junosphere. I want to invite you to test-drive our latest R3.0 and
    give us your impressions.<br /><br />You will find out that its new UI facilitates
    the creation and launch of topologies simplifyng the processes of older releases.<br
    /><br />Visit us at https://junosphere.net/test-drive so we enable your test drive.<br
