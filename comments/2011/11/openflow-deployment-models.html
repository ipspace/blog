            <div class="comment-content">I actually believe the Native OpenFlow Nirvana could be attained in datacenters space in not so distant future.  (I mean the routing/switching infrastructure, not loadbalancers, stateful firewalls and the like)<br /><br />First, OOB management is fairly common in DC environments (as you pointed out QFabric uses a similar approach), so this requirement is not a big deal.  Second, I&#39;m sure at least some the ONF players recognize the importance of &quot;fast control loops&quot; and we will see mechanisms supporting offload of these to dumb switches in OF1.x or 2.y.  Third, as OF is still in its infancy, I would not worry too much about vendor extensions - if successful, they may eventually make it to the standard OpenFlow spec before we start building our &quot;nirvana DC&quot;.<br /><br />There&#39;s still an issue of communicating with the non-OF world, to which we may see some interesting solutions, Juniper&#39;s integrated approach being one of, especially when combined with BGP speaking DC edge enabling granular control of traffic flows in/out of the DC.  For large distributed networks this could also provide the required inter-DC failure domain separation with a stable routing protocol implementation.</div>
