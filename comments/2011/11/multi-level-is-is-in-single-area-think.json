      "html": "Few comments :-)<br /><br />Inter-area MPLS-TE works to some extent in IS-IS, with either loose next-hop or with a verbatim statement (your trick for TE with EIGRP).<br /><br />Another one, the comment about misconfigured L1L2 router leaking a default route. Chances of that happening are slim, since to leak a default route, that L1L2 would have to have L1 adjacency as well as L2 adjacency in order to generate an update with ATT bit set, which would cause L1 routers to install a default route. Unlike OSPF&#39;s ABRs, IS-IS border routers don&#39;t actually advertise the default.<br /><br />The rest - I couldn&#39;t agree more on.<br /><br />-Marko.",

If you know you can do something with IOS (and flavors) it&#39;s almost guaranteed that you can do the same with JunOS, and until some years ago, you usually could do more. I also tend to trust JunOS defaults a bit more than the IOS* ones (I never enjoy the practice of hiding from the user the &quot;system default&quot;)<br /><br />For example your recent blog regarding label control/assignment is a good example how the JunOS default is much more sane compared to the IOS (incidentally I think I start configuring MPLS using one of your books and during the optimization stage of my first lab I think I used it to limit the announcement of labels to only my Loopback subnet).<br /> <br />I sincerely hope not many Service Providers are doing that &quot;stupid&quot; thing... if they are I recommend them to get one of Doyle&#39;s IS-IS books and all stupid things should be taken care of.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />(this javascript in macos chrome is still doing multiple posts...)",
