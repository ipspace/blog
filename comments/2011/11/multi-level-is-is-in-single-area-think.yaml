  html: Few comments :-)<br /><br />Inter-area MPLS-TE works to some extent in IS-IS,
    with either loose next-hop or with a verbatim statement (your trick for TE with
    EIGRP).<br /><br />Another one, the comment about misconfigured L1L2 router leaking
    a default route. Chances of that happening are slim, since to leak a default route,
    that L1L2 would have to have L1 adjacency as well as L2 adjacency in order to
    generate an update with ATT bit set, which would cause L1 routers to install a
    default route. Unlike OSPF&#39;s ABRs, IS-IS border routers don&#39;t actually
    advertise the default.<br /><br />The rest - I couldn&#39;t agree more on.<br
    /><br />-Marko.

  html: According to my understanding of the documentation, you can disable in an
    IS-IS level only on a per-interface basis.

  html: 'Another one of my &quot;what&#39;s not white is black&quot; blunders  :-P<br
    /><br />Of course I know there&#39;s loose next hop (even had it working in the
    lab once) and I wanted to say something along the lines of &quot;automatic MPLS
    TE&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s simple within a level&quot; ... Another proof that
    English is not my native language  :-$<br /><br />As for a misconfigured router
    - have to test what happens if you run multiple IS-IS instances on the same box
    (before you tell me how stupid I am: this is pure speculation).'

  html: in the interface you put the metric,hold-time etc ... under level 2 but there
    you dont have to disable level 1 if you did it in the under the protocol

    html: Strictly speaking, I believe the spec calls for the ATT bit to be set in
      the L1 LSP if the router can reach another area (and not necessarily directly
      L2-adjacent to that area).

  html: Even with multiple instances, ATT will be set inly if there&#39;s an adjacency
    in L2.

  html: in case of inter-area TE, re-optimization at abr is a very painful topic to
    cover, not even mention signal the path base on link-coloring/admin-grp.<br />these
    fancy isis design, like routes leak and att bit works perfect for ip world, but
    not mpls, just like many vendor choose to ignore over-load-bit.<br />run TE in
    single area makes everybody easy, or explicit path to mimic the old OTN concept,
    just my 1 cent.

  html: For the ATT bit to be set, I believe (might be wrong) that the L1/L2 &#39;router&#39;
    has to have adjacencies established in both L1 and L2 levels but they have to
    have different Area IDs (I should test this in a quick lab... but I&#39;m risking
    trusting my memory)<br /><br />Correct me if I&#39;m wrong.

  html: In my Service Provider &quot;book&quot; disabling the default L1/L2 adjacencies
    is probably the first thing I do after starting adding interfaces to IS-IS (for
    all the reasons you mentioned but also because I usually don&#39;t like defaults).<br
    /><br />Also, since apparently you started your journey in the JunOS world let
    me give you a thumb rule (been there done that). If you know you can do something
    with IOS (and flavors) it&#39;s almost guaranteed that you can do the same with
    JunOS, and until some years ago, you usually could do more. I also tend to trust
    JunOS defaults a bit more than the IOS* ones (I never enjoy the practice of hiding
    from the user the &quot;system default&quot;)<br /><br />For example your recent
    blog regarding label control/assignment is a good example how the JunOS default
    is much more sane compared to the IOS (incidentally I think I start configuring
    MPLS using one of your books and during the optimization stage of my first lab
    I think I used it to limit the announcement of labels to only my Loopback subnet).<br
    /> <br />I sincerely hope not many Service Providers are doing that &quot;stupid&quot;
    thing... if they are I recommend them to get one of Doyle&#39;s IS-IS books and
    all stupid things should be taken care of.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />(this
    javascript in macos chrome is still doing multiple posts...)

    html: Using default IGP routing within a SP core is usually not a good idea. Also,  the
      default L1+L2 behavior breaks MPLS LSPs. See the links in the blog post for
      more details.

  html: Nice Post. But I&#39;m wondering why most telcos deploy a single area level-2
    only  but not level-1. And also why not deploy level-2 in core and level-1 in
    access nodes and link both with level1-2.<br />
