Without IGP-LDP sync a router does not change IGP path (since it does not see any topology change), therefore traffic between the two routers is black-holed (label from the other router missing !). With IG-LDP sync enabled, the IGP change path even when the LDP session is down and the (OSPF or IS-IS) adjacency is &quot;up&quot; (tested with IOS, works fine !). Principle is obviously the same, advertise link where LDP session fails with the highest metric possible.",

One difference with IOS is that JUNOS advertise label bindings only for loopback interface instead of advertising label bindings for each network in routing table (as IOS does). You may change the default behaviour in both cases. My opinion is that JUNOS view is neater, since in a well designed IP/MPLS backbone, what you really need is a full mesh of LSP MPLS between loopbacks of PE routers (used for the full logical mesh of iBGP sessions). Adveritising label bindings for networks used to numeber point-to-point links or broadcast segments inside backbone infrastructure is a quite useless exercise.",
