            <div class="comment-content">You are so unbelievably out of touch with what really matters Ivan.. And yet your arrogance still continues to grow unabaited.  All of the vendors that you trash through your subtext are actually contributing to the network industry through development of competitive solutions to the actual problems that face IT in delivering business outcomes.  You however merely sit back and arrogantly poke holes in the work of dedicated engineers wihtout actually [cutting a line of code | producing an Rfc | investing in research (time or money) | offering the public anything more than your self righteous claptrap] and yet somehow feel that your efforts are worth people investing money in.  You are the day trader of the network industry.... riding off the backs of others opens work and deluding yourself into thinking you are contributing to society.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I have to agree with this.  I used to love your blog and look forward to what you have to say, now I just find you obnoxious.  Do you really think this lame report is worth $50?  You have become opportunistic and greedy, and you think way too highly of yourself.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">If you are going to call someone out, don&#39;t hide behind anonymity.  Also Ivan is actually one of the few people in the networking industry who are actively blogging about the various new technologies that come out.  Without this type of criticism, it is very difficult to judge the merit of a vendor&#39;s new offering (are you going to rely on vendor white paper to find short-coming of the said vendor?).  It is neither arrogance or trash talking when one is engaging in constructive criticism. <br /><br />Regarding the $ aspect, no one expects anyone to work for free.  This is his blog and a lot of the information he gives out are free, it is entirely up to his discretion if he wished to charge for certain things.</div>
