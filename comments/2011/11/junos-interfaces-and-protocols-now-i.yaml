  html: The glow is in the segmentation... for non webUI users this programming-like
    syntax is where some of the magic lies in.<br /><br />Wait until you get to firewalls,
    policy-statements :)<br /><br />Also, I think that your remarks regarding error
    messaging and/or junos documentation are not totally fair. JunOS documentation
    (depends what you are reading) actually tell you (it&#39;s junos basics) that
    at interface level you have to enable &#39;things&#39; that you want the interfaces
    to understand (like packet headers, therefore families). Once you know that everything
    works with this mindset it is really just a matter of knowing some basic troubleshooting
    commands like:<br /><br />show &lt;protocol&gt; interfaces/adjacency/summary<br
    /><br />One bit that might confusing (coming from IOS) is the rsvp vs mpls (what
    goes where), checking routing tables (since you now have all the inet.&#39;s and
    mpls.&#39;s.<br /><br />Anyway... has been a fun ride since I embraced both and
    I clearly have a preference. &lt;/protocol&gt;
