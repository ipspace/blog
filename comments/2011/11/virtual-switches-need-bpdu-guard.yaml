  html: Ivan, <br />According to this (http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps9441/ps9902/guide_c07-556626.html)<br
    /><br />&quot;Because the Cisco Nexus 1000V Series does not participate in Spanning
    Tree Protocol, it does not respond to Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) packets,
    nor does it generate them. BPDU packets that are received by Cisco Nexus 1000V
    Series Switches are dropped.&quot;<br /><br />The way I&#39;m reading that (and
    they have a nifty diagram above) is bpdu packets are dropped and not forwarded
    on to the physical switch.<br /><br />Not sure if Kurt was running the 1000v or
    not...if this is the case though at the very least Cisco needs to clear this up.

  html: I must admit, I didn&#39;t think it though that much. The places where I have
    worked (Multi lateral IXs) took the sledge hammer approach. Filtering everything
    bar blessed mac addresses and etherypes.<br /><br />While you could pre populate
    blessed macs at provisioning time in a hosted VM environment. I doubt that would
    fly in the enterprise arena.

  html: Exactly. If you want to actively configure bridging between two servers, be
    them virtual or physical, I don&#39;t think the network should prevent this from
    happening. This is pretty hard to achieve by accident (unlike wrongly patching
    switch uplinks). Network equipment should not patronize the administrator, it
    should protect from accidents.<br /><br />I would rephrase the title to &quot;Virtual
    switches should prevent VMs from impacting the network topology&quot;. BPDU guard
    is just one way to do so. Nice to bring this into discussion though.

  html: You could use vASA or VSG to filter BPDUs. VSG would make more sense, as it
    sits directly in front of vNIC (not yet sure how vASA interacts with vPath API).<br
    /><br />In both cases, BPDUs would be dropped before they would hit the physical
    link. You&#39;d still need &quot;reject forged transmits&quot; to prevent forwarding
    loops.

    of the devices in question - far more manageable than a STP loop.<br /><br />Really,
    it&#39;s no different to a server just maxing out it&#39;s interface by pulling
    random data from another source on the network.

    admin tries to solve *some application problem* by creating a bridge/etc. It doesn&#39;t
    work using the NX1K port profiles so he manually goes into vCenter and goes around
    it.<br /><br />In a typical public cloud environment I don&#39;t think this would
    be a problem since your customers should most likely have only a menu based system
    for ordering VMs, and not direct access to vCenter. Although you still have the
    sysadmin issue. :)'

  html: Another problem w/ the BPDU filter option is that most of the ports facing
    vSphere have portfast configured and receipt of a BPDU w/ BPDU filter enabled
    with disable portfast - something people often forget. <br /><br />The basic rule
    of thumb is you can drop BPDUs only in a guaranteed loopfree topology...

  html: Another thought is if you implemented BPDU guard in the vSwitch, that&#39;s
    also not ideal because you have prevented the use case where someone wants to
    bridge a VPN to a vNIC, like they have done in Ivan&#39;s example. BPDU guard
    functionality doesn&#39;t imply just dropping the BDPUs, it also implies shutting
    down the virtual port of the vSwitch connected to that VM. <br /><br />The primary
    use case is that virtual machines are not Ethernet bridges, so the current implementation
    works well for the common use case. However, where there are advanced use cases
    like this where VM is a bridge running STP - the admin has to do a little more,
    like either disable bridge code in Windows via registry (too complex and doesn&#39;t
    work in Cloud environments since management can be delegated but viable in non-Cloud
    use cases) or use products from VMware and partners to drop the BPDUs. For example,
    vShield App has a L2 firewall capability - you can drop all BPDUs sent by VMs
    at will with a point of enforcement being on every vNIC of VMs on the ESX host.
    If you do that, you have to create a loopfree topology. <br /><br />Will VMware
    do something interesting in vSwitch top to address this? Stay tuned, Ivan would
    be the first to know :-)

  html: Ivan, with regards to your VM-FEX offer, as far as i know all interfaces on
    N5K/N7K and UCS-FI that considered as HIF (host interfaces) on the FEX (2K/IOM/VM-FEX)
    have BPDU Guard on by default and you actually can&#39;t remove it. so assuming
    that a logical interface on the UCS-FI (vEthernet) receives a bpdu it will err-disable
    that interface.

  html: 'BPDUfilter, only when enabled globally, can prevent BPDUguard from triggering
    if a user/customer bridges two vNICs in ESX.<br /><br />Assumption: vSwitch truly
    provides loop-free forwarding as Ivan has mentioned/proven in other blog posts.
    (with the prevent forged option enabled)<br /><br />BPDUfiltering, enabled globally,
    filters outbound BPDUs on all portfast/edge ports. It also sends &quot;a few&quot;
    at link up to prevent STP race conditions and an ugly loop as a result. If it
    does receive BPDUs, it causes the port to fall out of portfast/edge mode.<br /><br
    />So, if a vNIC in ESX is bridged, the BPDUs never leave the pSwitch after the
    initial linkup to cause them to loop around in the vSwitch and reflected back
    to the pSwitch. This way, you get the following benefits:<br /><br />a) One bad
    VM won&#39;t trigger BPDUguard, thereby isolating a hypervisor (or a cluster in
    Ivan&#39;s example)<br />b) A miscabled host attached to a pSwitch port will fall
    out of portfast mode if BPDUs are seen from it. Protecting you from a bad sysadmin/cable-job
    with a non-loopfree (non vSwitch) looping the network.<br /><br /><br />Basically,
    enabling BPDUfilter globally circumvents Ivan&#39;s concern in the above blog
    about a non-ESXi being plugged into the network causing a loop. If one of these
    does get plugged in and has a loop, the switch will see the BPDUs at link up and
    move the ports out of portfast/edge.<br /><br />The only situation where this
    breaks down is a non-ESX hypervisor that has a vswitch that does not guarantee
    loop-free. In this situation, the pSwitch sees the uplinks as up and online, so
    no BPDUs have been sent in awhile, so a loop in the non-ESX vSwitch could be a
    devastating take down of your datacenter. Then, I&#39;m afraid, storm-control
    is your only friend.<br /><br />Outside of my Virtual-facing pSwitches, I would
    never do BPDUfilter, even globally....BPDUguard is a must for the rest of my network.'

  html: What would happen if you start the bridging VM __after__ the physical links
    have been up for quite a while?

    html: '... and how will you detect a loop? You know, bridges (including the bridging
      functionality in Linux or Windows) use BPDUs for a good reason.'

  html: Just thought about this topic once more....<br /><br />so what happen&#39;s
    if we use L2 Filters on the phy port incoming to drop all bpdu packets ?<br /><br
    />e.g. <br /><br />mac access-list extended BPDU<br />  ! deny IEEE STP <br />
    deny any any lsap 0x4242 0x0<br />  ! deny CISCO RSTP<br /> deny any any lsap
    0xAAAA 0x0<br />permit any any<br /><br />int g0/1<br />mac access-list BPDU in<br
    /><br />IMHO this would drop incoming frames whith bpdu&#39;s<br /><br />But maybe
    im wrong
