I believe what you will see is that it still thinks there is a route to the opposing network so traffic routes and black holes on spoke to spoke communications even through the tunnel is not up to allow the traffic actually route.<br /><br />This was something I haven&#39;t seen come into play in any 15.x routers, it was only the 12.4(18e) routers I saw it on.<br /><br />Then again maybe I a missing what you are trying to point out.",

This is a problem I can see. <br /><br />I stumbled upon your blog quite recently and this is just an awesome source of info.<br /><br />Cheers!",
