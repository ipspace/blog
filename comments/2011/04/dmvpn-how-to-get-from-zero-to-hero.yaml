  html: Cisco produced a lot of very detailed design documentation for this solution
    and although the official design has changed a lot over time, the basics are pretty
    well known. It&#39;s pretty easy wrapping your head around how it works as implemented
    but the real challenge is when things are not working so well and you need to
    deploy your knowledge of troubleshooting the different technologies.  Adding to
    the complexity,  the spoke sites are generally VSAT flyaway suites of widely varying
    reliability, staffed by a mixed bag of uniformed military and contractors, and
    containing some very cool-but-fragile tunneling of several higher classification
    level networks with the accompanying line encryption, and you&#39;ve got yourself
    a lot to learn in a short amount of time. good luck and stay safe my friend!<br
    /><br />PS managing these DMVPN networks is cake compared with dealing with the
    cranky TDMA network management systems provided by GD and the like. In my experience,
    these systems and poor configuration management were the biggest enemies of the
    health of these tactical networks.

  html: I think John would be off to a good start if he also did the tasks outlined
    in this Cisco doc:<br /><br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk583/tk372/technologies_configuration_example09186a008014bcd7.shtml<br
    /><br />I know its not really a book and perhabs not everything is explained,
    but maybe it gives John some knowledge of what he can expect :)<br /><br />/Kelvin

  html: If it&#39;s broke and he needs to fix it right away- you can&#39;t beat the
    cisco docs like Kelvin mentions.  From 0 to hero, having just done this (I&#39;m
    not a hero yet, maybe a side kick...), I&#39;d do:<br /><br />CCNA Official Exam
    Certification Library for a good intro to networking<br />http://www.amazon.com/Official-Certification-Library-640-802-Containing/dp/1587201836/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1302202458&amp;sr=1-1<br
    /><br />If you&#39;re not worried about the cert, skip the CCNP track (although
    the troubleshooting section is REALLY helpful) and read Doyle&#39;s Routing TCP/IP
    I and II.<br />http://www.amazon.com/Routing-TCP-IP-1-2nd/dp/1587052024/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1302202545&amp;sr=1-1<br
    />http://www.amazon.com/Routing-TCP-CCIE-Professional-Development/dp/1578700892/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1302202591&amp;sr=1-1<br
    /><br />Stretch&#39;s blog is great- I&#39;d also read the DMVPN design guide
    here:<br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/WAN_and_MAN/DMVPNttl.html<br
    /><br />The trick is learning how to filter out exactly what you need to know
    versus what&#39;s nice to know.  He really can&#39;t skip too much on the foundation,
    but once you get through Doyle&#39;s books everything seems to make a lot more
    sense, and you can see the commonality in the technology.

  html: 'Here is an update which may help you to understand the specific configurations
    being used.<br /><br />First, Cisco has a PDF which addreses the architecture
    at a high level but in more depth than the link listed by meher zmania below:
    http://www.cisco.com/application/pdf/en/us/guest/netsol/ns171/c649/ccmigration_09186a008075ea98.pdf<br
    /><br />But even better is this document specifically about the JNN with router
    examples which show how SIPRNET is tunneled over NIPRNET over this DMVPN architecture
    along with some detailed technical info on the program of record terminals which
    comprise many of the terminals: http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fmi6-02-60.pdf<br
    /><br />There are tons of more detailed design docs but I couldn&#39;t really
    find any links.'
