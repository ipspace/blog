      "html": "Cisco produced a lot of very detailed design documentation for this solution and although the official design has changed a lot over time, the basics are pretty well known. It&#39;s pretty easy wrapping your head around how it works as implemented but the real challenge is when things are not working so well and you need to deploy your knowledge of troubleshooting the different technologies.  Adding to the complexity,  the spoke sites are generally VSAT flyaway suites of widely varying reliability, staffed by a mixed bag of uniformed military and contractors, and containing some very cool-but-fragile tunneling of several higher classification level networks with the accompanying line encryption, and you&#39;ve got yourself a lot to learn in a short amount of time. good luck and stay safe my friend!<br /><br />PS managing these DMVPN networks is cake compared with dealing with the cranky TDMA network management systems provided by GD and the like. In my experience, these systems and poor configuration management were the biggest enemies of the health of these tactical networks.",

      "html": "If it&#39;s broke and he needs to fix it right away- you can&#39;t beat the cisco docs like Kelvin mentions.  From 0 to hero, having just done this (I&#39;m not a hero yet, maybe a side kick...), I&#39;d do:<br /><br />CCNA Official Exam Certification Library for a good intro to networking<br />http://www.amazon.com/Official-Certification-Library-640-802-Containing/dp/1587201836/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1302202458&amp;sr=1-1<br /><br />If you&#39;re not worried about the cert, skip the CCNP track (although the troubleshooting section is REALLY helpful) and read Doyle&#39;s Routing TCP/IP I and II.<br />http://www.amazon.com/Routing-TCP-IP-1-2nd/dp/1587052024/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1302202545&amp;sr=1-1<br />http://www.amazon.com/Routing-TCP-CCIE-Professional-Development/dp/1578700892/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1302202591&amp;sr=1-1<br /><br />Stretch&#39;s blog is great- I&#39;d also read the DMVPN design guide here:<br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/WAN_and_MAN/DMVPNttl.html<br /><br />The trick is learning how to filter out exactly what you need to know versus what&#39;s nice to know.  He really can&#39;t skip too much on the foundation, but once you get through Doyle&#39;s books everything seems to make a lot more sense, and you can see the commonality in the technology.",
