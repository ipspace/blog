  html: Ivan brings up pretty valid points on scalability too but people who don&#39;t
    understand networking should not just wave it away.<br /><br />System is automatically
    creating 3rd grade networks, that is, I agree. They are good for small (&lt;100
    hosts) environment, I&#39;d be curios to see what is going to happen in real production
    environment on scale of 0.001 of AMZN for starters. It will go down in flames
    would be my guess.

  html: Nice job Ivan. But I still not understand why they&#39;re implementing cool
    &quot;looking&quot; features when they do all to code a backend-behaviour that
    matches the setup without layer 2 segmentation.<br /><br />I would like to host
    customers on a flat physical layer 2 network and virtualize a layer 2 network
    per customer (backed by portgroups ie.). I thougth the vCDNI was the right solution
    but I was curious about real mecanisms behind and read your article about. Now
    I&#39;m confused, how can I get virtual Layer 2 segmentation whithout adding new
    VLANs on my physical switches each time a new customer comes in? For those who
    are behind an edge gateway it&#39;s not really problematic... but we have customers
    that have VMs directly based on the public network. And I would like to make other
    VMs in same class C /24 net invisible to them. Thanks!

  html: Thanks for explications. But now I&#39;m confused, how can I build virtual
    layer 2 networking on top of one physical layer 2 network (it means without adding
    new vlans each time I want to add customers, that would be around few hundreds
    ?<br /><br />Would portgroup backed network pools with vlan-id set + Brocade VDX/VCS
    switch be a solution?<br /><br />Thanks!
