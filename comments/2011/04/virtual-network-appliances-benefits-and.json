I just don&#39;t see how that scales very well in large environments... but either way, I haven&#39;t read the SearchNetworking link, (need to register).. a thought",

The configuration appears convoluted (personal preference). <br /><br />We were creating a GRE IPSEC tunnel back to another campus and you had to run a few scripts (that we didn&#39;t know existed) before the tunnel would properly come up. A Cisco being on one end and a Vyatta on the other.",

So its really difficult to leverage these resources for a virtual appliance.  Unfortunately lot of network services I know ( e.g firewall, APM with DPI capabilities ) require these special chips.",

      "html": "&quot;If virtualization enables servers to be spun up and down on demand for cost efficiency and agility, wouldn&#39;t it make sense to implement virtual network components too?&quot;  Not to me....<br /><br />I think the whole idea of &#39;virtualizing network appliances&#39; is a temporary solution to the broader problem of &#39;virtualizing the network&#39;. The problems of performance and scalability you point out are only part of the problem. If you start moving workloads around suddenly you&#39;ve got to consider where your network devices are running?? How crazy is that?",

Going a step further, after moving to PaaS, we won&#39;t need server virtualization any more.<br /><br />However, in real-life circumstances, virtualized network appliances are sometimes the lesser evil (although they do make for interesting traffic flows).",
