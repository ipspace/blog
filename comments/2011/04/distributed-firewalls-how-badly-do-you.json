If you would design this scenario in a redundant way (active - standby, with asymetrical traffic), and for some reason the FW lose the connection, both think they are the active ones, right? I think we&#39;ll have the same problem as described here, but from the opposite direction.<br />Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong.<br /><br />So, beside your Google style solution, there is no other alternative?<br /><br />Thanks",

      "html": "Ivan,<br />To reduce the risk of the datacenter interconnect, what I have done in multiple occasions within the past year was recommend a strategy where the client had a primary fast datacenter interconnect (usually dark fiber) between his 2 sites and as a backup to that use an L2TPv3 pseudowire over what is usually the client&#39;s existing L3 WAN. To avoid bridging each site&#39;s STP domain, I would use either REP (Cisco) or RRPP (HP) as a ring protocol responsible for the datacenter &quot;ring&quot;, each link being terminated on either ME3400s with Cisco or an IRF pair of A-series HP switches.<br /><br />With REP, you can only break the ring with STP in one location, and you have to use a stackwise pair in the other end with flex links to both of the local &quot;ring devices&quot;. One of the Cisco Live sessions had some nice designs that suggested that, and it works very well.<br /><br />With an IRF pair, those problems are taken care of as the device is a single entity, and thus only runs the ring protocol over the datacenter interconnect (the private fiber and the pseudowire).<br /><br />The end result is that the risks of a dual active, split-brain scenario are very much reduced, and the ring protocol ensures fast convergence and STP domain isolation.",

Despite you say it could not work in some situations, I can find too few of them.<br />Even if a weird ISP gets equal path via different peers (very uncommon situation) it would be unbelivably weird of him to configure ebgp load sharing and further more balancing per packet not flow. True miracle are things working without human intervention, it&#39;s architect&#39;s/engineer&#39;s job to find these 1% issue cases and fix them.<br />People do not rely on anycast because they were tought in their childhood &quot;TCP-anycast doesn&#39;t work, forget it!&quot; Well, it does in fact and saves huge amunts of money and nerves.<br />Solution is not for vendors or integrators getting money for selling boxes and complicated designs. It&#39;s for internal staff willing to sleep well and get money for doing nothing.<br /><br />Anycast is not for clusters. Who cares? They are back-ends. You can choose DCI with AToM and pay for it or create your own with L2TPv3+IPSec+Internet to syncronize them. Traffic will go through the same ISP equipment with the same delays/jitter/ploss. These L2 links must be kept as few as possible or totally avoided by configuring primary/secondary options on front-ends.<br /><br />HTTP can work with anycast and it&#39;s the major application companies need today, even global monsters. I bet there are so few tcp applications lacking support of this technology that it should be brought back to humankind.<br /><br />If there&#39;s anyone with a large company network to design I&#39;d love to participate and implement anycast.

(for example the core router in the other data center)<br /><br />If the DCI fails then both WAN routers notice this. The question is then what should happen. It depends what services are available in both datacenters. Depending on that answer you have multiple options.

      "html": "So when is a DCI a &quot;DCI&quot;?<br /><br />I am considering a design for a customer in which their DCI is 4 LAGed pairs of customer-owned dark fiber between two buildings which are 100ft from each other.  (I know...not much for DR, but it&#39;s what they have to work with).  We could tag separate VLANs across the DCI to interconnect the various pairs of devices (eg. one for HSRP/IBGP on the internet edge routers, another for state-sync on the firewalls).<br /><br />Would you still frown on this architecture if the data centers were on opposite ends of the same building?<br /><br />Opposite ends of the same data center?<br /><br />Opposite ends of the same rack?<br /><br />You can see the crux of my question is becoming &quot;What precise factors make the DCI such a weak to be avoided as a cluster link.<br /><br />Is it:<br />a - High Latency?<br />b - Probability of being mechanically disturbed by the ditch diggers?<br />c - Probability of being logically disturbed by malfunctioning service provider equipment?<br />d - Using the same link to connect multiple &quot;clusters&quot;  (ie. tagging a VLAN for each cluster link instead of using a separate cable for each cluster link as would normally be the case if they were in the same data center)  I DO hate the idea that losing this DCI would require every pair of devices to simultaneously recalculate mastership.<br /><br />In my case criteria A and C are not a concern due to the short distance, and the private nature of the customer-owned fiber.  However B and D are still factors to be weighed.<br /><br />Thoughts?",

      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Regarding the line that reads, &quot;A reliable layer-3 solution is not much easier to design.&quot;  ---   Is the use of the word, &quot;not&quot; a typo perhaps?   I ask this just because I&#39;m confused, since the first sentence seems incongruent with the remainder of that paragraph.   The rest of the paragraph appears to convey that your client decided to fall back to an L3 DCI, in light of the complexity of the stretched L2 design you devised.  <br /><br />Please forgive my question, if this isn&#39;t a typo.  I ask this only for the purpose of clarifying my understanding of your post.  <br /><br />Thanks,<br />Scott<br />",
