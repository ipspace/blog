            <div class="comment-content">Biggest issue I&#39;ve had with any Virtual Network appliance (by issue, I mean opinion), is the software driven part.. goes back to be too CPU dependent. I just don&#39;t see how that scales very well in large environments... but either way, I haven&#39;t read the SearchNetworking link, (need to register).. a thought</div>

            <div class="comment-content">We just purchased a company that runs vyatta hardware. Definitely does not scale well. The configuration appears convoluted (personal preference). <br /><br />We were creating a GRE IPSEC tunnel back to another campus and you had to run a few scripts (that we didn&#39;t know existed) before the tunnel would properly come up. A Cisco being on one end and a Vyatta on the other.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Yeah, that&#39;s my biggest grudge as well. You get what you pay for.<br /><br />CPU-based processing might not be bad in some cases (WAF, load balancing) where you can&#39;t do much in ASIC anyway. Routing on a VM is a total waste of resources (VMware tends to disagree  :-P )</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Didn&#39;t have chance to read searchnetworking.com as well cuz of registration requirement  ( lazy ).  <br /><br />Not all the special purpose chips ( nitrox cavium , regex engine, 1588 ) are virtualized for hypervisor to share with virtual machines ( guilty of only verifying this for VMWare vSphere ).  So its really difficult to leverage these resources for a virtual appliance.  Unfortunately lot of network services I know ( e.g firewall, APM with DPI capabilities ) require these special chips.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&quot;If virtualization enables servers to be spun up and down on demand for cost efficiency and agility, wouldn&#39;t it make sense to implement virtual network components too?&quot;  Not to me....<br /><br />I think the whole idea of &#39;virtualizing network appliances&#39; is a temporary solution to the broader problem of &#39;virtualizing the network&#39;. The problems of performance and scalability you point out are only part of the problem. If you start moving workloads around suddenly you&#39;ve got to consider where your network devices are running?? How crazy is that?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ideally, I would agree with you. Going a step further, after moving to PaaS, we won&#39;t need server virtualization any more.<br /><br />However, in real-life circumstances, virtualized network appliances are sometimes the lesser evil (although they do make for interesting traffic flows).</div>
