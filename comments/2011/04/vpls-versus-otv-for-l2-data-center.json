      "html": "About a year ago, I tried making a blog post on exactly the same topic :) Back then OTV was still more of  &quot;obscure&quot; technology, so I had to dig the Cisco&#39;s patent that dated back in 2007-2008. I believe Cisco has pretty good comparison of OTV/VPLS on their website as well:<br /><br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps9441/ps9402/white_paper_c11-574984.html<br /><br />In my opinion, it is more correct comparing OTV to MAC-based MPLS VPNs, rather than VPLS. Though the MAC-based VPNs slowly progress through IETF, so not sure if they will make it to the end :) Oh, another good reference to compare with would be IPLS, that implemented MAC address learning based on protocol signaling.<br /><br />As for P2MP support in VPLS (we have IGMP snooping at least!), I hope Cisco will finally make it available this year - now that they have had mLDP implemented for quite a while.",

      "html": "Hi Ivan nice topic!  <br />during my broadcast experience (IPTV), i have appreciated multicast, specially IGMPv3 with double encapulation source and same IP source, Destination M group to archive best reliability in core network (squared topology with double PE and P).  <br /> <br />In and between the DCs why we should use the multicast ? Which applications do a intensive use of multicast between and inside DC? I suppose in and between DCs unicast is predominant, isn&#39;t ?  <br />could i use multicast for backup purpose ?  <br /> <br />thanks a lot  <br /> <br />P.S.  <br />However i think for IPTV is not necessary LSP P2MP, P2P MPLS-TE tunnel, (difficult to manage double source with the same address), yes 50 ms of FRR is not so bad but a fine tuning of IGP (in global) offers 150 ms in my case. Sure we have a private backbone and all it&#39;s more easier. Yes we had used the classical MPBGP MPLS-VPN (i read your book ) for intranet, management and voip.",

Though interesting in terms of how things were done and the use of certain protocols to achieve something unnatural to those protocols(analogy alert!) the appearance of a round peg in a square hole is present.  The use of eem scripts to clear mac address tables et al. make for a bowl of kludge.<br /><br />VPLS for certain solutions(pseudowires/xconnect) may be the choice in unique situations but not for data center bridging/linking.<br /><br />OTV appears as others here have mentioned to be the opportunity to simplify the architecture and approach to handling data center bridging needs. Let\u2019s hope so. Otherwise more \u201csplit brain\u201d for the network architect/engineer.<br /><br />Regards\u2026",

      "html": "hello Ivan , thanks for this article and I think the DF - Don&#39;t Fragment characteristic present in all &#39;OTV packets&#39;  is also worth to be mentioned here ; regarding the tunnels and otv we must say that regarding the transport of the c-plane/d-plane it&#39;s all GRE based today but is likely to evolve to UDP based in the future NX-OS developments. Otherwise I think it&#39;s just a great concept for some deployments , especially for layer 2 multicast applications.  <br />Cheers ! <br />michal",

      "html": "Hi,<br /> <br /> I wondered if you have any comments on running multicast across OTV extensions? We have hit a whole bunch of bugs and problems over the last year or so and it doesn&#39;t seem to have been thought through all that thoroughly. The technology was deployed before I joined the company and I wouldn&#39;t have deployed something that looks to be so untested if I was here earlier, plus it doesn&#39;t appear to be fit for purpose anyway based on the limits:<br /><br /> We have messaging applications that use a single mcast address as an index so this group is sent and received on all clients. Whilst we are a small amount of users, the OTV mcast groups soon mount up and have hit the ~2ooo limit. I do like the ground up design of OTV but it seems pretty crazy to have such a low limit on the amount of OTV mcast routes? I dont see how this could be considered a viable or best alternative to other l2 extension technologies when running multicast?",
