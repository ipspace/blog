  html: Amen.. VPLS and A-VPLS are really for folks who have vast majority of Cat6K
    and don&#39;t want to spend extra $$ to redesign their infra with N7K.  Which
    might be wise thing to do and wait until OTV matures.

  html: About a year ago, I tried making a blog post on exactly the same topic :)
    Back then OTV was still more of  &quot;obscure&quot; technology, so I had to dig
    the Cisco&#39;s patent that dated back in 2007-2008. I believe Cisco has pretty
    good comparison of OTV/VPLS on their website as well:<br /><br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps9441/ps9402/white_paper_c11-574984.html<br
    /><br />In my opinion, it is more correct comparing OTV to MAC-based MPLS VPNs,
    rather than VPLS. Though the MAC-based VPNs slowly progress through IETF, so not
    sure if they will make it to the end :) Oh, another good reference to compare
    with would be IPLS, that implemented MAC address learning based on protocol signaling.<br
    /><br />As for P2MP support in VPLS (we have IGMP snooping at least!), I hope
    Cisco will finally make it available this year - now that they have had mLDP implemented
    for quite a while.

  html: Hi Ivan nice topic!  <br />during my broadcast experience (IPTV), i have appreciated
    multicast, specially IGMPv3 with double encapulation source and same IP source,
    Destination M group to archive best reliability in core network (squared topology
    with double PE and P).  <br /> <br />In and between the DCs why we should use
    the multicast ? Which applications do a intensive use of multicast between and
    inside DC? I suppose in and between DCs unicast is predominant, isn&#39;t ?  <br
    />could i use multicast for backup purpose ?  <br /> <br />thanks a lot  <br />
    <br />P.S.  <br />However i think for IPTV is not necessary LSP P2MP, P2P MPLS-TE
    tunnel, (difficult to manage double source with the same address), yes 50 ms of
    FRR is not so bad but a fine tuning of IGP (in global) offers 150 ms in my case.
    Sure we have a private backbone and all it&#39;s more easier. Yes we had used
    the classical MPBGP MPLS-VPN (i read your book ) for intranet, management and
    voip.

  html: Lots of kludges, I can&#39;t say I truly understand, I&#39;m hoping someday
    to catch one of your courses. <br /><br />But in my company&#39;s implementation
    of metro-ethernet/application vrf/L3-VPN I believe we use VPLS (over MPLS) between
    the CE and PE. Then in the core its BGP L3 VPN.<br /><br />To me this all seem
    like kludges. OTV seems to have a chance of simplifying these architectures that
    is until AT&amp;T, Verizon and the rest start throwing their weight around at
    Cisco and Juniper to throw in their kludges.

  html: OTV uses multicast on the overlay to distribute L2 broadcasts/multicasts between
    edge devices. You have to propagate broadcasts across the WAN if you want to emulate
    L2 infrastructure and using IP MC for that is the optimal solution (assuming,
    of course, your WAN backbone supports IP MC).

  html: Whether it&#39;s kludgy or not depends on what you&#39;re trying to achieve.
    For example, L3 VPN is best for path isolation. If that&#39;s what you need, you
    can&#39;t get a more scalable solution than MPLS/VPN.

  html: assuming, of course, your WAN backbone supports IP MC).  <br />and i completely
    agree with you if we want deliver a L2 transparent intra-datacenter and across
    private/service provider WAN, for example to use Vmotion service.  <br /> <br
    />But for example for DC interconnectivity across IP Cloud like internet (no native
    multicast support) and only L3 end2end connectivity today DMVPN can be the valid/best
    solution ?

  html: "Another great post Ivan and I enjoy the analogies. Kludges, true. I went\
    \ through the  \u201CInterconnecting VPLS\u201D book this past summer. Though\
    \ interesting in terms of how things were done and the use of certain protocols\
    \ to achieve something unnatural to those protocols(analogy alert!) the appearance\
    \ of a round peg in a square hole is present.  The use of eem scripts to clear\
    \ mac address tables et al. make for a bowl of kludge.<br /><br />VPLS for certain\
    \ solutions(pseudowires/xconnect) may be the choice in unique situations but not\
    \ for data center bridging/linking.<br /><br />OTV appears as others here have\
    \ mentioned to be the opportunity to simplify the architecture and approach to\
    \ handling data center bridging needs. Let\u2019s hope so. Otherwise more \u201C\
    split brain\u201D for the network architect/engineer.<br /><br />Regards\u2026"

  html: hello Ivan , thanks for this article and I think the DF - Don&#39;t Fragment
    characteristic present in all &#39;OTV packets&#39;  is also worth to be mentioned
    here ; regarding the tunnels and otv we must say that regarding the transport
    of the c-plane/d-plane it&#39;s all GRE based today but is likely to evolve to
    UDP based in the future NX-OS developments. Otherwise I think it&#39;s just a
    great concept for some deployments , especially for layer 2 multicast applications.  <br
    />Cheers ! <br />michal

  html: Thanks for reminding me. The DF bit is a must; without it, the receiver gets
    burnt out in reassembly process.

  html: as you say , probably not easy for a wire speed switch. In general the NX-7K
    is not able to fragment but reassembling seems to be a more difficult task in
    terms of processing so that&#39;s why they are putting the DF in each IP header
    of the OTV packet. <br />The missing part is for me the whole interoperability
    of the future UDP  (  http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hasmit-otv-01  )  vs. current
    GRE based OTV.

  html: Hi,<br /> <br /> I wondered if you have any comments on running multicast
    across OTV extensions? We have hit a whole bunch of bugs and problems over the
    last year or so and it doesn&#39;t seem to have been thought through all that
    thoroughly. The technology was deployed before I joined the company and I wouldn&#39;t
    have deployed something that looks to be so untested if I was here earlier, plus
    it doesn&#39;t appear to be fit for purpose anyway based on the limits:<br /><br
    /> We have messaging applications that use a single mcast address as an index
    so this group is sent and received on all clients. Whilst we are a small amount
    of users, the OTV mcast groups soon mount up and have hit the ~2ooo limit. I do
    like the ground up design of OTV but it seems pretty crazy to have such a low
    limit on the amount of OTV mcast routes? I dont see how this could be considered
    a viable or best alternative to other l2 extension technologies when running multicast?

  html: Please excuse the anonymous. Just to add, the mcast routes are doubling up
    per vlan and after extending 5-10 vlans have reached the limits of OTV mroutes.

  html: Why no discussion between 2012 and 2016? I guess vMotion is deemed misconception,
    DCI multicast is deemed &quot;unnecessary&quot;. So, VPLS barely stays, OTV fades
    away.
