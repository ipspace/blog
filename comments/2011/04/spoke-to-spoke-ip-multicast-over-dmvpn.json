      "html": "I put together a configuration using dmvpn to get around a service provider not supporting multicast over their MPLA core.  As you said above spoke-to-spoke is not really possible without multicast maps.  I was lucky in my case as this was for a MoH source and there was only two potential sources.  These were hubs with pim adjacencies to the rest of the spokes.<br /><br />I was playing around with pim nbma mode which worked nicely user 12.4T but behaved differently under 15T, how I have yet to investigate.<br /><br />I was hoping with pima nbma mode it would act in a similar fasion as ospf in point to point mode by having the hub as a point of replication for other spokes, but no dice.<br />Even though each neighbor was individually listed in the OIL, replication only was to members on others on alternate interfaces in the OIL.",
