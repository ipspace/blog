  html: So hopefully they&#39;ve improved the code as well.. it&#39;s been about a
    year since I&#39;ve worked on F10 boxes.. they&#39;re great little L2 devices
    (E1200s, C300s were the one&#39;s I&#39;ve mostly worked with) and some S50s with
    the old SFTOS=eww..<br /><br />Either way, they did ok, but getting features implemented
    and bugs fixed was a bit of a hassle..<br /><br />For those looking at price/performance
    though, you may not go wrong.

  html: Alot has changed at F10 from a year ago.  Hardware and software have both
    been updated quite a bit, and it&#39;s very cool to see them push and support
    open standards.

  html: Good question. I would guess the answer is NO.
