They are good for small (&lt;100 hosts) environment, I&#39;d be curios to see what is going to happen in real production environment on scale of 0.001 of AMZN for starters. It will go down in flames would be my guess.",

      "html": "Nice job Ivan. But I still not understand why they&#39;re implementing cool &quot;looking&quot; features when they do all to code a backend-behaviour that matches the setup without layer 2 segmentation.<br /><br />I would like to host customers on a flat physical layer 2 network and virtualize a layer 2 network per customer (backed by portgroups ie.). I thougth the vCDNI was the right solution but I was curious about real mecanisms behind and read your article about. Now I&#39;m confused, how can I get virtual Layer 2 segmentation whithout adding new VLANs on my physical switches each time a new customer comes in? For those who are behind an edge gateway it&#39;s not really problematic... but we have customers that have VMs directly based on the public network. And I would like to make other VMs in same class C /24 net invisible to them. Thanks!",

      "html": "Thanks for explications. But now I&#39;m confused, how can I build virtual layer 2 networking on top of one physical layer 2 network (it means without adding new vlans each time I want to add customers, that would be around few hundreds ?<br /><br />Would portgroup backed network pools with vlan-id set + Brocade VDX/VCS switch be a solution?<br /><br />Thanks!",
