            <div class="comment-content">Ivan brings up pretty valid points on scalability too but people who don&#39;t understand networking should not just wave it away.<br /><br />System is automatically creating 3rd grade networks, that is, I agree. They are good for small (&lt;100 hosts) environment, I&#39;d be curios to see what is going to happen in real production environment on scale of 0.001 of AMZN for starters. It will go down in flames would be my guess.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Nice job Ivan. But I still not understand why they&#39;re implementing cool &quot;looking&quot; features when they do all to code a backend-behaviour that matches the setup without layer 2 segmentation.<br /><br />I would like to host customers on a flat physical layer 2 network and virtualize a layer 2 network per customer (backed by portgroups ie.). I thougth the vCDNI was the right solution but I was curious about real mecanisms behind and read your article about. Now I&#39;m confused, how can I get virtual Layer 2 segmentation whithout adding new VLANs on my physical switches each time a new customer comes in? For those who are behind an edge gateway it&#39;s not really problematic... but we have customers that have VMs directly based on the public network. And I would like to make other VMs in same class C /24 net invisible to them. Thanks!</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Thanks for explications. But now I&#39;m confused, how can I build virtual layer 2 networking on top of one physical layer 2 network (it means without adding new vlans each time I want to add customers, that would be around few hundreds ?<br /><br />Would portgroup backed network pools with vlan-id set + Brocade VDX/VCS switch be a solution?<br /><br />Thanks!</div>
