  html: I put together a configuration using dmvpn to get around a service provider
    not supporting multicast over their MPLA core.  As you said above spoke-to-spoke
    is not really possible without multicast maps.  I was lucky in my case as this
    was for a MoH source and there was only two potential sources.  These were hubs
    with pim adjacencies to the rest of the spokes.<br /><br />I was playing around
    with pim nbma mode which worked nicely user 12.4T but behaved differently under
    15T, how I have yet to investigate.<br /><br />I was hoping with pima nbma mode
    it would act in a similar fasion as ospf in point to point mode by having the
    hub as a point of replication for other spokes, but no dice.<br />Even though
    each neighbor was individually listed in the OIL, replication only was to members
    on others on alternate interfaces in the OIL.

  html: Thanks for the feedback! It&#39;s nice to hear this thing actually works in
    a real-life network.

  html: Ivan, can you post the complete configuration of the devices because i still
    have problem multicasting from hub-to-spoke and spoke-to-spoke. to enable spoke-to-spoke
    multicast beside configure ip nhrp map multicast remote-spoke-nbma-add, what else
    should i configure? how about the RPF check if im using pim sparse-dense-mode
    or pim sparse-mode? hope that there will be a solution soon. many thanks.

  html: I have done this but not as you have explained. I did rollback to DMVPN Phase
    1 without dynamic spoke-to-spoke tunnels. That way it works too.

  html: I&#39;m wondering if with SDWAN/Overlay Orchestrator solutions, we can now
    make this work in a scalable way ?
