Independent mode needs to be explicitly disabled (I believe it&#39;s &quot;port-channel standalone-disable&quot;) to avoid the negative impact of this accidental mismatch which can be severe mac flap issue and mac learning suspensions on the switch if load-balancing algo on the vswitch is flow-based.  In an environment where there are non-ESX servers using LACP this sort of operational mistake happens and can be quite bad.",
