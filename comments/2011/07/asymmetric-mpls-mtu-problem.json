      "html": "I totally agree this shouldn&#39;t be a problem if well managed, but I&#39;d like to share an &quot;issue&quot; I had to troubleshoot a couple of years ago. <br /><br />Consider the network above.<br /><br />The system administrator logs on to C, and tries to ping S.  With the DF bit set, 1496 byte pings are successful.  1497+ pings result in a &quot;Fragmentation needed&quot; ICMP response.  Groovy.<br /><br />Now he logs on to S and tries the same thing towards C.  He finds that 1496 bytes is fine as before.  1500+ generates the &quot;Fragmentation needed&quot; as before.  However there is a 4 byte &quot;black hole&quot; where there are no responses seen.<br /><br />The reason for this is that the echo request packet actually makes it all the way from S to C, but the echo response packet is too big to get back.  This leads to an ICMP message getting sent to C, but this never gets shown to the originator of the packet at S.  Leading to the apparent problem (this issue is specific to ping though - real application traffic gets through just fine).<br /><br />This caused a fair amount of head scratching before we got to the bottom of it.",

Simple IP/MPLS network with asymmetric MTUs (which you always get) is enough.  <br /> <br />#2 - The apparent black hole occurs because the &quot;Fragmentation needed&quot; message is sent to the host sending ICMP reply (not request). That host cannot do anything; there&#39;s no &quot;I have a problem&quot; ICMP message it could send to the pinging host.  <br /> <br />#3 - TCP traffic works just fine because the &quot;Fragmentation needed&quot; message is always sent to the host sending oversized TCP segment (which then gets split into smaller segments)",

That might explain lack of support in Cisco IOS.<br /><br />Also, the end-to-end LSP MTU signaling is largely irrelevant in most cases; interim LSRs send ICMP error messages with the original label stack, so they eventually arrive to the intended recipient. <br /><br />Knowing end-to-end MTU would be quite important, though, if the interim LSRs would have no data-plane IP capability (plus it would allow you to push error processing to the network edges, which is always a good idea).",
