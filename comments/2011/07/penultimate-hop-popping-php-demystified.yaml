  html: Excellent explanation,but i still have a doubt lingering in my mind.<br /><br
    />PHP can be requested by a router in the core of  the SP network(it might be
    doing some summarization)?

  html: Doubt no more! Whenever a router has to perform an L3 lookup, it will signal
    implicit (or explicit) null. ABR is no exception (which, as it happens, is also
    documented above ;) ). That&#39;s the reason you should never summarize BGP next
    hops in MPLS/VPN networks.

  html: Hello Ivan,<br /><br />If i have a scenario such as  PE1 ---- P1 ---- PE2
    . <br />If instead of advertising labels for loopback interfaces, we advertise
    for directly connected interfaces between these two routers, then will it work?
    ( considering that PE1 and PE2 each have reachability to one another ? )
