In this case forcing east-west traffic further up actually improves latency consistency (yes, it is a bit crappier, but *consistently* so) ;)<br /><br />-- D",

      "html": "&lt;quote&gt;<br />Web servers exchange traffic with end-users (browser clients) or back-end application or database servers, which are usually in a different VLAN (so the traffic has to cross a layer-3 device or even a firewall). Application servers usually have the same traffic characteristics.<br />&lt;/quote&gt;<br /><br />I actually believe Yandi had a &quot;DFC type&quot; distributed functionality in mind, so that even in the different vlan scenario (mentioned above) the traffic is still switched locally inside the &quot;DFC&quot;. The only thing that matters is that the src and dst port are on the &quot;same line card&quot; of Nexus 5000, regarless of vlans/routing.<br /><br />This of course does not make you wrong, just pointing out that argumenting with different vlan could be misleading.",

Dell now offers all the simplicity of a &quot;dumbed-down&quot; forwarding device that also performs MAC learning and can support east-west traffic flows. The device I am speaking of is the Dell PowerEdge IO Aggregator blade module for the m1000e blade server chassis. ",
