  html: 'Ivan,<br /><br />To further expand your point: with automatic workload management
    (for example, VMware DRS), you can&#39;t reliably say if your VMs are going to
    sit on the same host or on different hosts. In this case forcing east-west traffic
    further up actually improves latency consistency (yes, it is a bit crappier, but
    *consistently* so) ;)<br /><br />-- D'

  html: I have a question here, when connecting a single N2k extender to its parent
    N7k, do you suggest to connect it towards multiple M132xp cards or to a single
    M132xp card? <br /> 8-)

  html: '&lt;quote&gt;<br />Web servers exchange traffic with end-users (browser clients)
    or back-end application or database servers, which are usually in a different
    VLAN (so the traffic has to cross a layer-3 device or even a firewall). Application
    servers usually have the same traffic characteristics.<br />&lt;/quote&gt;<br
    /><br />I actually believe Yandi had a &quot;DFC type&quot; distributed functionality
    in mind, so that even in the different vlan scenario (mentioned above) the traffic
    is still switched locally inside the &quot;DFC&quot;. The only thing that matters
    is that the src and dst port are on the &quot;same line card&quot; of Nexus 5000,
    regarless of vlans/routing.<br /><br />This of course does not make you wrong,
    just pointing out that argumenting with different vlan could be misleading.'

  html: Best practice here would be to spread your FEX links across the multiple M132
    cards.

  html: 'Ivan, you make some interesting points. However, the choice is no longer
    between a full-blow dot1Q bridge and a dumb-down FEX. Dell now offers all the
    simplicity of a &quot;dumbed-down&quot; forwarding device that also performs MAC
    learning and can support east-west traffic flows. The device I am speaking of
    is the Dell PowerEdge IO Aggregator blade module for the m1000e blade server chassis. '
