Additionally, if you define your interface with &#39;flexible-vlan-tagging&#39; you also get another 4 bytes of encaps for the q-in-q tag.<br /><br />Luckily, Junos has a handy way of determining the equivalent IOS MTU/L2-less MTU.  &#39;sh interface &lt;name&gt; detail&#39; will print both the &quot;ip mtu&quot; and even the mpls MTU for you.&lt;/name&gt;",

      "html": "I have been explaining why MTU is a heavily misused term a lot recently. When talking about the raw layer 2 maximum PDU size I prefer to use maximum frame size, as it should be unambiguous.  Of course in this case the 1514 bytes is not the maximum frame size, it includes the header + payload but excludes the 4 byte FCS trailer.<br /><br />It seems that in this case IOS-XR is acting exactly like JunOS, as the interface MTU is specified exactly this way there too.  In JunOS the reason for excluding the FCS is a quirk in the hardware forwarding.  I don&#39;t know the reasoning in IOS-XR...",

Any other use of &quot;MTU&quot; is in my opinion both incorrect and potential harmful. <br /><br />If some device uses the phrase MTU as the maximum Ethernet frame size there are very high risk of confusion and misconfiguration. For example, would &quot;1514&quot; as in the text above still allow the 4 byte FCS checksum and possible a 4 byte 802.1Q tag? ",

      "html": "Just starting with the 9Ks.  We were having problems getting stable EIGRP relationships to 6500s.  We were also getting input errors.  I thought we had a layer 1 issue, although it didn&#39;t seem likely.  Somehow I decided to stick with troubleshooting the EIGRP relationships.  It&#39;s a good thing I did, because once I fixed the MTU the relationships came up and the input errors also went away.<br /><br />This discussion was very helpful, so thank you for it!",
