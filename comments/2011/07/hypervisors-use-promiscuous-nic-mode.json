I recently tried to deploy a Wireshark VM on Hyper-V only to find that it would not work because the virtual NIC was not promiscuous. I also recently implemented a VOIP recording package that did not support Hyper-V and the manufacturer said it was because of the same. I might be missing something but I think Hyper-V may in fact differ in this regard.",

A &quot;vmnic&quot; is a physical NIC port, which as you say, connects to the internal vSwitch and needs to deliver all frames from the physical network up into the virtual switch - and from that the vmnic must be promiscous.",

Switch is just a multi port bridge.<br /><br />I would be very much surprised to find out that vNICs are _not_ running in promiscuous mode, since they are actually links to the internal virtual switch. <br /><br />So there is nothing new here and Ethernet 101 is still valid :)",

Getting promiscuity working within a vSwitch is well documented in the intertubes.<br /><br />Hi Ivan,<br />I&#39;m glad you find the observation interesting enough to share.<br /><br />FWIW, I don&#39;t think (m)any NICs are able to listen to just &quot;a few&quot; *multicast* addresses, because multicast filtering is typically done with a hash bucket scheme.  Unfiltering one group unfilters many groups.<br />I&#39;ve blogged about the situation here:<br />http://www.fragmentationneeded.net/2010/10/vmware-runs-in-promiscuous-mode.html<br /><br />The NIC filtering is a topic of interest to me because I used to run big-scale multicast applications in environments where I didn&#39;t control the L2 topology.  On occasion, multicast groups I wasn&#39;t interested in slipped through the hardware filtering and crushed the OS.<br /><br />I&#39;m only aware of one NIC with lots of filtering capability:<br />http://www.lhcomp.com/vendors/neterion/NeterionXframeIISunFireDataSheet.pdf<br />\u2022 Unicast/Multicast Rx frame filtering for up to 256 address/mask pairs",
