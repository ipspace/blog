      "html": "&quot;Lesson#2 \u2013 work on the solution.&quot;<br /><br />sublesson : let people work on the solution. The technical guys need to concentrate on fixing the problem : the director or commercial calling every other minute to know where things are won&#39;t help. Of course, to do their job, they also need to be informed of what&#39;s going on.<br /><br />The best is to have a team working on the actual problem, another doing disaster management (calling customers, or answering calls...) and only one or two people passing the information between the teams. They can also keep track of events for later.<br /><br />And yeah, the meal / beer for everyone involved fter the rush is important.  :)",

      "html": "I spent a year at Sungard assisting folks with the network portion of their recovery.  A couple of things to consider:  <br /><br />(1) Don&#39;t rely on recovery techniques that completely bomb from a single second of network downtime.  <br />(2) Don&#39;t think your DR vendor/provider knows how to build your network in the recovery center.  <br />(3) Napkins do not count as documentation<br />(4) Have a coherent telecom plan.  So important here.  That guy at Vz or ATT at 1AM that takes calls inbetween naps does not care about your circuit.  Have all circuit IDs, acct numbers, the names of all the people of your account team and their cell numbers, and every escalation number you have ever been given.  If you can swing it, get the names of the COs that circuits are supposed to recover at.  You can never have enough info for these companies when a real disaster strikes.  <br />(5) Ditto for Cisco, Juniper, Citrix, Checkpoint, etc.  Make sure you have licenses and arrangements that allow for recovery on devices whose serial numbers are not on your support contract.  Have all numbers, account team members names/cell numbers, etc... You&#39;re going to need it<br />(6) Active/Active DR scenarios mean you should not be operating above 50/50 capacity.  You have failed already if you exceed this and there is a disaster.  theres no way around it.",
