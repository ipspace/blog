      "html": "&quot;Summary: using the default settings in Cisco IOS, whenever two routers establish an LDP session, all IP packets forwarded between them become labeled packets with an MPLS label stack.&quot;<br /><br />This is a bit of a simplification  (understandable in a short summary article ;) ).  There is another default behaviour that can cause confusion around MTUs...<br /><br />By default local connections will be advertised with the &quot;implicit null&quot; label, which will result in penultimate-hop-pop (PHP) behaviour.  When you have PHP taking place and an MTU constraint you can end up with paths that have asymmetric MTUs.<br /><br />This can be real fun to troubleshoot if you aren&#39;t expecting it.   :)",

VoIP packets are very small, so they&#39;re not affected by that.<br /><br />The &quot;MPLS MTU&quot; actually specifies the maximum MTU of a labeled packets, so you need to increase that to 1508.

When I enable mpls between 7609 (it has access to internet, and it&#39;s our core router) and 7206 (our distribution/access router), internet traffic is  dropped. When I see which internet traffic is affected, It&#39;s TCP traffic. I&#39;m pretty sure that UDP traffic is OK because I enabled mpls between 7206 and 7204 and transport voice traffic only(UDP), without problems. It could be a MTU issue? I have mpls mtu and ip mtu in 1500.",
