      "html": "I see some potential issues with the static to Null0. Even if the connected interface goes down on CE-A the network will still be announced to ISP-A. So traffic from the Internet will always be entering ISP-A even if firewalls route towards ISP-B. This will lead to assymetric routing and firewalls don&#39;t like that so they would probably drop all the sessions. <br /><br />But traffic won&#39;t probably even make it that far. If connection to PUB-SUB is down on CE-A then traffic will be blackholed (assuming only one interface to PUB-SUB).",

We are running HSRP between CE routers, iBGP between CE routers (direct connect) and HA firewalls.

With the BFD it is fine, and you can easily assign a track object to the HSRP monitoring.<br /><br />If you are really tricky, you can use the EEM to do the LAN BGP monitoring, but HSRP is much faster and easier.",

      "html": "Our edge network is way over complicated, but it was designed to be very flexible. We have 2 primary data centers, 2 backup sites, and rent space at a local colo. We currently have 4 upstream internet connections, each of them peer to their own edge router, now, at each primary data center we have a pair of ASRs that aggregate those routes. They also form a loop between the 2 sites, and the colo facility (where one of our circuits comes in) where we have a 3750x. That loop runs an IGP to supply reach-ability for each edge router to peer via iBGP to each of the ASRs. The ASRs run a second IGP instance to advertise a default route to our firewalls, which readvertise it into the core. <br /><br />As for external routing, we&#39;re splitting our netblock up between the two sites, advertising half at each, plus the whole netblock to ensure reachability to our entire address space if one of the sites goes down. The ASRs advertise those netblocks to the edge routers that peer with our upstream ISPs.",

      "html": "As an alternative design, we run eBGP through our firewalls by creating an internal AS on the inside of our network.  From the inside we distribute the appropriate routes to the edge routers to advertise externally.  If for some reason a firewall pair fails for any reason or the router becomes an island, the BGP connection inside will fail and the advertisements will drop from the edge router.  It&#39;s setup in a square, two edge routers running iBGP, two internal routers running iBGP with a private AS, and two sets of firewalls that we run eBGP through.  Then you just need some local-prefs/med to control the traffic flow, and to remove-private and you&#39;re good to go.<br /><br />It&#39;s a little complicated, but if you don&#39;t trust your firewalls and have diverse locations, this is an option.",
