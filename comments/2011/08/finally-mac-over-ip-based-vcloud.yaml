  html: '&gt; (probably hash-generated based on original MAC frame)<br /><br />https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan-00
    :<br /><br />&quot;It is recommended that the source port be a hash of the inner
    Ethernet frame&#39;s headers to obtain a level of entropy for ECMP/load balancing
    of the VM to VM traffic across the VXLAN overlay.&quot;<br /><br />&gt; cannot
    terminate the virtual segments on physical switches<br /><br />&quot;One deployment
    scenario is where the tunnel termination point is a physical server which understands
    VXLAN. Another scenario is where nodes on a VXLAN overlay network need to communicate
    with nodes on legacy networks which could be VLAN based. These nodes may be physical
    nodes or virtual machines. To enable this communication, a network can include
    VXLAN gateways (see Figure 3 below with a switch acting as a VXLAN gateway) which
    forward traffic between VXLAN and non-VXLAN environments.&quot;<br /><br />Some
    exciting developments, indeed! List of authors on the draft is also quite telling.

  html: 'Duh, still a weak solution :) Is that all industry have to offer us today?!
    What they&#39;ve done is just slightly leveraged softswitching and pushed the
    tunneling mesh directly to the VM edge. However, dynamic learning is there, flooding
    is still occurring - none of the core scalability problems have been properly
    addressed. I mean, having the tunneling rooted at VM layer would allow switch
    to directly know all VM MACs and handle broadcast messages in distributed directory
    fashion. There have been numerous proposals to address that problem, but for some
    reasons the industry seems to ignore that :)<br /><br />Here is a comparable example:
    imagine that MS NLB has been re-implemented using IP multicast, where client&#39;s
    IP packet destined to a VIP is encapsulated into a tunnel with multicast destination
    IP address and sprayed to all members of a HA cluster. Effectively, this allows
    stretching NLB over IP network, but would it make NLB more scalable or easier
    to troubleshoot? :)'

  html: Absolutely agree. While it&#39;s better than what we had before, it&#39;s
    not even close to what Amazon EC2 does, and disappointing in its near-sightedness.
    However, any alternative more to our liking would require some L3 awareness in
    NX1K and it seems that for some L3 is a monster best avoided.

  html: Yeah, I know you _can_ terminate VXLAN on physical devices (in principle),
    but you _can&#39;t_ do it today or any time soon.

  html: Considering that this requirement is quite important (i.e. without it the
    functionality is not very useful), I was hoping it will be addressed soon... But
    then again, only time will tell.

  html: Don&#39;t count on that happening soon. They&#39;ve solved the immediate problem
    (isolated IaaS networks) and already have a &quot;solution&quot; for your other
    problem (vShield Edge or any other VM-based L3 device).

  html: Great article... Thanks for taking the time to give your opinion about this,
    imo, exciting new technology...
