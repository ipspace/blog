      "html": "Hi gurus,<br /><br /> <br />a) I am going to be deploying a 50 - 100 spoke DMVPN sites and could go. It is going to be a dual hub configuration. Some of these sites will just be dmvpn spokes,  and others, the dmvpn is going to be a backup tunnel to the our MPLS cloud. Currently the MPLS is running over OSPF, which is getting redistributed via BGP in the ISP world, therefore the routes I get are external E1 OSPF advertised routes.<br />b) I would also like the dual hub to have a dmvpn vpn tunnel between them, so as a backup between the hubs incase the MPLS WAN drops. <br /><br />Im in the need of some good advice and thoughts about selecting the right routing protocol, EIGRP or OSPF.<br />So anyone with experience and hands-on knowledge on such an installation - please feel free to comment on &quot;goods and bads&quot; regarding the two routing protocols :-)<br /><br />Questions:<br /><br />1) What would be the recommended protocol for 50 to 100 tunnels, but keeping in mind these sites can grow so scalability is key ?<br />2) With External Type 1 OSPF routes being advertised, the E1 routes are required to be primary and the DMVPN redundant. Which routing protocol can handle this best with EIGRP being metric 90 and OSPF 110. What is the best way to influence metric in this scenerio ?<br />3) Out standard is using OSPF, therefore would  prefer to stick with OSPF for DMVPN, but handling internal v/s external routes could be a challenge as DMVPN would be internal routes ?<br />4) OSPF could have scalability issues, metric preference issues ? What are your thoughts ?<br /><br />Thanks",

I do have it all configured in a lab,  running OSPF on the internal network, redistributed to EIGRP for DMVPN and running FVRF and IVRF for the DMVPN routers. When in production, MPLS is running OSPF - E1, and need to make sure it gets the preference over DMVPN.",
