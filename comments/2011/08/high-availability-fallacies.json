Done.<br /><br />The problem is to provide a HA solution for anything that has to do with persistent local data. This may include the database in (relatively) modern 3 tiers app but it also includes more traditional Enterprise applications (Exchange being an example).<br /><br />It is not even worth discussing how to provide resiliency to the front end. It&#39;s done. Focus your energies for the back-end.<br /><br />Massimo.",

      "html": "We totally agree - back end is a tough nut. However, until you solve the DB (more precisely, ACID data store) problem, you won&#39;t have a truly HA application. VMware HA or Windows failover cluster(s) buy you nothing but automatic restart after a hardware failure. The DB service still has to restart (and roll back all pending transactions) after every failure, which takes a significant amount of time.<br /><br />However, both SQL Server and MySQL offer a redundant server configuration, where the second server can take over immediately when the first one fails. High-end MySQL offers an even better distributed solution. So the problems can be solved ... but it&#39;s easier to offload them to someone else and believe in unicorn tears.",

The reason for which it starts sooner on the other side is because it has lost all transactions the application think have been committed. It&#39;s good if you are hosting an application that shares pictures... not good if you deal with money. <br /><br />Having this said there is clearly a trend for which this backend is being made more &quot;scale out&quot; friendly... but it will be a long way to go. <br /><br />My 2 cents.",

      "html": "I am reading this article again... The funny thing is that I understand what you are trying to get at but this is only true in an ideal world where Applications are specifically written to support a setup that includes load balancers and a shared database. Although everyone wants this to be true, reality is that we are nowhere near this ideal world.<br /><br />In most enterprise organizations I have been at least 80% of the applications, which are essential to the line-of-business day-to-day, don&#39;t support this kind of set up. This is one of the reasons HA is so widely adopted today. On top of that there is a substantial cost associated to load balancers and a shared database configuration (yes needs to be clustered / distributed as well) which might be more than the SLA requires. In those cases vSphere HA / FT / VM and App Monitoring are the way to go. 5 clicks and it is configured, no need to have special skills to enable it... just point and click.<br /><br />Once again, I agree that using a vFabric load balanced setup (shameless plug :)) would be ideal, but there are far too many legacy apps out there. Even in the largest enterprise orgs the IT department cannot control this, even the line-of-business cannot control it... main reason being that they are suppliers not taking the time to invest.<br /><br />Go vSphere HA<br /><br />Duncan<br />yellow-bricks.com",

Many applications that are used on a day-to-day basis have a small database. Many apps for instance used at financial institutions are simple apps just to calculate what a mortgage would cost. Now although this might be 20MB app it is essential to the line-of-business and you might not think it is critical but they feel it is. <br /><br />Unfortunately critical doesn&#39;t equal current or mature application architecture.",
