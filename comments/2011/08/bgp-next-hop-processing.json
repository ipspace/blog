         "html": "Hi Ivan, excellent summary, but there are few statements that may require a little bit of clarification.<br /><br />Firstly, for leaking the edge link IP prefixes into IGP. A while ago, it made total sense to either change the next-hop to self or leak edge prefixes into BGP, to maintain reachability to provider managed devices at customer premises. This ensured network stability, to some extent. Nowadays, the requirements for fast convergence based on BGP NHT/PIC may dictate that edge link prefixes are leaked into IGP, for the purpose of fast event propagation. Furthermore, preserving the eBGP next-hop has some useful accounting implications, e.g. when exporting BGP next-hop in Netflow and looking to construct &quot;external&quot; traffic matrix. And network stability could be still controlled by using exponential event dampening (low-pass filtering).<br /><br />Secondly, using redistribution no longer has advantage of &quot;faster SPF&quot; over type-1 LSA injection with the introduction of iSPF (invented in ARPANet!) to both OSPF/ISIS. Even without iSPF, SPF takes insignificant time of overall convergence process on modern CPU&#39;s - the majority of time is spent updating distributed forwarding tables after a change. Furthermore, redistribution might be even considered dangerous due to type-5 LSA&#39;s having larger flooding scope (there have been well-known precedents with that), not to mention that type-5 LSAs consume more memory and create more flooding overhead (less of concern, though). <br /><br />Thirdly, changing next-hop to self on a route-reflector *may* be required even in production network if you need to ensure that RR is in the forwarding path to avoid route deflection (not the best design, though). This operation is also a key component for building hierarchical LSPs using BGP-based label propagation for overlay LSPs.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Petr",

Both routes were installed in the routing table. The next-hop itself was reachable (ping/traceroute). However the destination was not: when debugging with &#39;debug ip packet&#39;, the router picked a loopback as the source (instead of the outgoing interface) and then declared the packet unroutable. Making the next-hop known through IGP fixed the problem. <br />Did you ever run into such an issue ? I could not find any explanation for it. My release is 12.4(15)T10.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for all the great information you share on your site.<br />Cheers,<br />Mat",
