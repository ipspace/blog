      "html": "After a few months, it might not be as surprising as it is now for the reader. I&#39;d much rather use eBGP to craft route policy than any IGP. IGP&#39;s are great for fast convergence and finding the shortest path, but there is a reason we don&#39;t use it on the Internet.<br /><br />There are many ways to route a large global network with multiple security domains and different teams of network engineers working independently. I can&#39;t imagine Google or Microsoft not using eBGP internally. It provides such a very nice clean delineation between different parts of the network. I have do direct knowledge of the MSFT network, so I&#39;ll use them as an example, I hope that their Bing and XBox Live and MSDN sites are managed somewhat independently, after all they are all likely pretty big networks with different security requirements and perhaps different protocol requirements. XBox, for example, might want to leverage multicast, whereas Bing might want to optimize for protocol simplicity. When different parts of the network have different business requirements, IMHO, it makes sense to isolate them with eBGP.<br /><br />Confederations are great whenever one group of engineers wants to divide up their own network into more manageable chunks, but with my example above, do confederations still seem to be the most logical solution? I think ASN scale more with the number of network engineers than routers. Just a SWAG.<br /><br />Cheers!",

Stability at large-scale deployments could be questioned, especially if it&#39;s not explicitly defined - e.g. Internet routing tables are never entirely stable and hence global routing using BGP never converges. Scalability is also tricky, and this problem has been intensely discussed for the last 6-7 years at least. While I&#39;m 100% sure you are perfectly familiar with both of these facts, I still wanted to point out that BGP has some well-known drawback and could not serve as a &quot;bulletproof&quot; solution. There are many common issues associated with BGP deployments that are not very well documented, for some reason :)",

Management is another tricky issue, and I believe it is the major scaling factor for large network - probably even more important than platform and protocol limitations. It is interesting that on the networks of that scale, implementation and operations play much more significant role than architectures, in my opinion. After all, designing an architecture for a large network is not that hard. Implementing, operating and maintaing it in good posture is much more challenging problem :)",

      "html": "Hi Ivan, great article.  I work with a lot of large Data Center&#39;s, and these massively scalable DCs (MSDC) are all using BGP for the routing. A question came up recently regarding the use of IBGP or EBGP.  Typically the DC is laid out in a spine leaf architecture, where a row of large routers make up the spine, and the leaf is a top-of-rack (ToR) switch/router.  I tested both IBGP and EBGP in this setup, and found the performance and convergence times to be the same. Both use ECMP to utilize all available links.<br />-IBGP requires the spine router to all be route-reflectors, and a route-map is used on the leaf peering to set the nexthop to the peering address.  This essentially makes IBGP function like EBGP.<br />-To deploy EBGP, the spine is all one AS, and each leaf is a different AS.  So every leaf router is its own AS. I found this to consume a lot of private AS space, and operationally be a lot more complicated.<br />Do you see any other advantages or disadvantages with either design?  I think this is a really cool use of BGP in the MSDC&#39;s, and wanted to share this since it shows how IBGP can be used without an IGP. :)",
