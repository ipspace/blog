            <div class="comment-content">Very well done, Ivan. One quick caveat about the Nexus 6100 as of this writing. You are correct that the 6100 can connect to a FCoE <i>target</i> upstream (as long as there is a FC fabric created somewhere, either via MDS, N5k, or even Brocade using FC NPV mode). As of this moment, there is no FCoE &quot;northbound&quot; to another switch, however. This functionality is forthcoming, but I believe it&#39;s fair to give people the best information to make decisions at this point in time.<br /><br />As soon as this changes, I&#39;ll let you know. :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The funny part is that it wasn&#39;t until after I wrote the original article that I realized you came up with the terms SM/DM (I&#39;d lazily assumed that it was part of the standard). I&#39;m not a multi-cast guy, so it took a little bit to figure out why the actual terms were so widely reviled :) <br /><br />The article came from my frustration that FCoE is such a broad term that it tells you nothing on how a device can actually fit into a network, yet vendors tend to talk like the small subset of the ways they implement it represents all of FCoE.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&quot;Vendors tend to talk like the small subset of the ways they implement it represents all of FCoE.&quot;<br /><br />Tony, that&#39;s not really fair. FCoE is a protocol, just like FC is and TCP/IP is. What you&#39;re trying to do is force-fit a metaphor onto FCoE that doesn&#39;t exist for any other protocol by tying implementation to it. If we took your sentence and applied the various protocol options, would it still hold water:<br /><br />&quot;FC is such a broad term that it tells you nothing on how a device can actually fit into a network&quot;<br /><br />&quot;TCP/IP is such a broad term that it tells you nothing on how a device can actually fit into a network&quot;<br /><br />&quot;InfiniBand is such a broad term that it tells you nothing on how a device can actually fit into a network&quot;<br /><br />None of these are fair criticisms of the *protocols* (although there are many, many fair criticisms to be had!) :)<br /><br />Frustration is a way for your brain to tell you you&#39;re learning something new, and what you&#39;re doing is running a grave risk of confusing yourself later on as people take these building blocks and apply them to different implementations that you have not pre-defined. <br /><br />Blaming the vendors (and since I&#39;ve stepped up to the plate and attempted to answer your questions to the best of my ability, by extension you&#39;re blaming me for not being clear enough), seems to imply a willingness (or intention) to dissemble that doesn&#39;t exist.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi J, <br /><br />First of all, I do want to apologize. If I sounded like I was being critical of you in particular (I&#39;m a bit critical of Cisco, but not much) it wasn&#39;t my intention. I like the work that you do and you FCoE posts have been most helpful. <br /><br />&quot;Vendors tend to talk like the small subset of the ways they implement it represents all of FCoE.&quot;<br /><br />You&#39;re right, that&#39;s probably not an entirely fair statement. I didn&#39;t mean it is a critique, more of a tendency that comes from being familiar with a certain subset of a topic. <br /><br />The Juniper/Cisco spat is a good example of that. Juniper talked about needing TRILL, which depending on how you look at it is true or not true. For them, it&#39;s true. For Cisco, it&#39;s not. You said that TRILL is absolutely not required for FCoE, which is true (but not true if you have non-FCF forwarding bridges, where you really need something other than STP). <br /><br />To the outside learner, that&#39;s a bit confusing. And confusion only makes FCoE less attractive (I teach Cisco UCS day in and day out, and FCoE doesn&#39;t tend to be popular among anyone in any of the classes, even among the FC people). <br /><br />So that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been following Ivan&#39;s lead in breaking it down. It seems to be helping as well. In Server Load Balancing (ACE, F5, etc.), it&#39;s all load balancing, but the way you put a load balancer into a network is different. There&#39;s routing mode, one-armed mode, DSR, a few others. It all does the same thing (mostly), but in terms of how you architect a network, it makes a big different. And there are design considerations for each.  <br /><br />I think it makes sense to do the same thing with FCoE. <br /><br />When you consider the difference between FCF and non-FCF switching, it makes much more sense. You did a really good job of explaining FCF-based FCoE switching, my only actual critique was that you didn&#39;t explain that there were other ways to do it (and the FCF-, which I agree). <br /><br />Tony</div>
