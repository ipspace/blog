            <div class="comment-content">&gt; (probably hash-generated based on original MAC frame)<br /><br />https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan-00 :<br /><br />&quot;It is recommended that the source port be a hash of the inner Ethernet frame&#39;s headers to obtain a level of entropy for ECMP/load balancing of the VM to VM traffic across the VXLAN overlay.&quot;<br /><br />&gt; cannot terminate the virtual segments on physical switches<br /><br />&quot;One deployment scenario is where the tunnel termination point is a physical server which understands VXLAN. Another scenario is where nodes on a VXLAN overlay network need to communicate with nodes on legacy networks which could be VLAN based. These nodes may be physical nodes or virtual machines. To enable this communication, a network can include VXLAN gateways (see Figure 3 below with a switch acting as a VXLAN gateway) which forward traffic between VXLAN and non-VXLAN environments.&quot;<br /><br />Some exciting developments, indeed! List of authors on the draft is also quite telling. ;)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Duh, still a weak solution :) Is that all industry have to offer us today?! What they&#39;ve done is just slightly leveraged softswitching and pushed the tunneling mesh directly to the VM edge. However, dynamic learning is there, flooding is still occurring - none of the core scalability problems have been properly addressed. I mean, having the tunneling rooted at VM layer would allow switch to directly know all VM MACs and handle broadcast messages in distributed directory fashion. There have been numerous proposals to address that problem, but for some reasons the industry seems to ignore that :)<br /><br />Here is a comparable example: imagine that MS NLB has been re-implemented using IP multicast, where client&#39;s IP packet destined to a VIP is encapsulated into a tunnel with multicast destination IP address and sprayed to all members of a HA cluster. Effectively, this allows stretching NLB over IP network, but would it make NLB more scalable or easier to troubleshoot? :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Absolutely agree. While it&#39;s better than what we had before, it&#39;s not even close to what Amazon EC2 does, and disappointing in its near-sightedness. However, any alternative more to our liking would require some L3 awareness in NX1K and it seems that for some L3 is a monster best avoided.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Don&#39;t count on that happening soon. They&#39;ve solved the immediate problem (isolated IaaS networks) and already have a &quot;solution&quot; for your other problem (vShield Edge or any other VM-based L3 device).</div>
