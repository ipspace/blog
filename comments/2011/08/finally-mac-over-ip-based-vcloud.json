Another scenario is where nodes on a VXLAN overlay network need to communicate with nodes on legacy networks which could be VLAN based. These nodes may be physical nodes or virtual machines. To enable this communication, a network can include VXLAN gateways (see Figure 3 below with a switch acting as a VXLAN gateway) which forward traffic between VXLAN and non-VXLAN environments.&quot;<br /><br />Some exciting developments, indeed! List of authors on the draft is also quite telling. ;)",

      "html": "Duh, still a weak solution :) Is that all industry have to offer us today?! What they&#39;ve done is just slightly leveraged softswitching and pushed the tunneling mesh directly to the VM edge. However, dynamic learning is there, flooding is still occurring - none of the core scalability problems have been properly addressed. I mean, having the tunneling rooted at VM layer would allow switch to directly know all VM MACs and handle broadcast messages in distributed directory fashion. There have been numerous proposals to address that problem, but for some reasons the industry seems to ignore that :)<br /><br />Here is a comparable example: imagine that MS NLB has been re-implemented using IP multicast, where client&#39;s IP packet destined to a VIP is encapsulated into a tunnel with multicast destination IP address and sprayed to all members of a HA cluster. Effectively, this allows stretching NLB over IP network, but would it make NLB more scalable or easier to troubleshoot? :)",

However, any alternative more to our liking would require some L3 awareness in NX1K and it seems that for some L3 is a monster best avoided.",
