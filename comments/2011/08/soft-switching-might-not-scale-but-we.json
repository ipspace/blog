      "html": "You need hardware abstraction if you want to implement portable/movable VMs. All the new architectures proposed by networking vendors (802.1Qbg/Qbh/VM-FEX) conveniently ignore that fact.<br /><br />Having implemented hardware abstraction, it doesn\u2019t cost much to add minimal L2 forwarding functionality (which is the part usually called \u201csoft switching\u201d). More complex soft switching methods (like MAC-over-IP) will be more CPU-expensive, but it\u2019s still the hardware abstraction that consumes most of the CPU resources.",

      "html": "One thing that I&#39;d agree with that the status quo btw. hypervisor vendors (OK let&#39;s put it plainly -- VMware) and networking vendors seems to get worse (from the being &quot;shaky&quot; to begin with).<br /><br /> Vendor bias aside  (I do belong to one) the reluctance of accepting one/several standards  -- e.g SR-IOV VEPA/802.1Qbg or VN-tag/E-tag/802.1Qbh/802.1BR etc (lost track of that...)  depending which house colors one currently wears / what cooks ones noodle -- seems to push us back into the vSwitch &amp; dvSwitch nightmares.  So, the choice I see is btw letting a hypvervisor dictates a de-facto modus operandi or continue working on interop standards.<br /><br />I do agree on the need of HW abstraction, but AFAICT current SR-IOV approach does adress that in the adapter (at least in part i.e. the logical division of a physical device into several logical). <br /><br />So, my question is: What part of current approaches do you consider &quot;square peg / round hole&quot;  and what would be the disadvantages of continuing the SR-IOV path ? Or the thought of having e.g. Brocade Trident+ (or similar capable ASICs) as powering (future) &quot;physical interface&quot; adaptors ?",

Not likely though.<br /><br />And finally there&#39;s the cleanup/initialization phase before/after vMotion event. Somewhat hard to do with a generic NIC driver.<br /><br />Of course you could develop new drivers and try to push them into production environments, but I don&#39;t think anyone (but the NIC/switch vendors) is interested.",
