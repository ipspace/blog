      "html": "We use this exact scenario, but with eBGP for the routing protocol as you describe at the end.  It works great except a few caveats:<br /><br />1) we have found that we must use some sort of marking scheme (community in our case) on the hub side to ensure that remote site routes learned over the DMVPN path are not advertised to the MPLS VPN service from the hub<br />2) a local pref/as path prepend scheme is needed to ensure MPLS VPN path is used over DMVPN<br />3) a community-based scheme to set local-preference at the hub based on a community attached to a route advertised from the remote site can be very useful when in a restrictive change environment, as inbound and outbound paths are controlled from the remote site only.<br /><br /> 8-)<br /><br />We have had some concerns with running out of private AS numbers, as we use a similar scheme for customer connectivity on our extranet, so we are considering a model where we use iBGP and set the next hop with a route-map to make iBGP behave more like eBGP and to avoid the need to run an IGP to the remote sites over DMVPN for NLRI information.",

On the hub I&#39;m setting community the routes I get from dmvpn spokes and with route map out to mpls peering I&#39;m denying routes matching this community. It&#39;s not working though? Am I doing it wrong way?",

But how can I redistribute ibgp learned(local-as) routes to eigrp? I can redistribute ebgp learned (original bgp as in hub) routes to eigrp for the DC devices reach to spokes via mpls. What about via dmvpn?",
