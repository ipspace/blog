  html: "&gt;You need high pressure to get diamonds. Without it, you\u2019re left\
    \ with coal.<br /><br />MacGyver: Pressure turns coal into diamonds. Is that it?\
    \ <br />Ryman: Well, that is a physical fact, MacGyver. <br />MacGyver: It can\
    \ also crush it to dust!"

  html: Anyone see that flying pig go past?!? I think our team will take the &quot;achievement&quot;
    of having got Ivan to suggest a L2 DCI as much more rewarding than coming up with
    a diamond of a design ;)<br /><br />Ivan, thanks once again for your awesome contribution,
    all of us in the team will mark it down as a highlight of our careers to have
    had the opportunity to work with you directly.

  html: Pressure and heat make diamonds, but you cannot remove the fact that it also
    takes the proper amount of time to get it right.<br /><br />Love the &quot;increased
    failure domain&quot; quote.  Engineers, programmers, and similar tech folk would
    probably be recognized as the world&#39;s greatest subtle comedians if only others
    could understand the humor.
