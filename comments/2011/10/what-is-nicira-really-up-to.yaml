  html: Nicira has the same problem that VXLAN has...there is no native switch-router
    that talks this protocol where you can &quot;escape the cloud&quot; and bridge
    to a native VLAN/switch environment. Once our major network vendors provide a
    &quot;interface vlan\n switchport vxlan(or openflow) &lt;identifier&gt;&quot;,
    that might be a &quot;killer app&quot;. Until then, we dream of MPLS-speaking
    vSwitchRouters. :-)&lt;/identifier&gt;

  html: It just might be possible to get hardware termination of GRE tunnels working
    (need to check the encapsulation OVS uses), but since GRE tunnels mostly get implemented
    as point-to-point interfaces, the configuration would be a major beast.<br /><br
    />However, if you&#39;re a cloud provider, you might not care - you give the customer
    the option of running yet another VM instance to do L3 routing or firewalling
    (like VMware does with vShield Edge). I still think virtual appliances are suboptimal,
    but you really don&#39;t care if you charge them by CPU cycles spent and the customers
    are willing to pay for that.
