  html: Ivan, just thinking out load here but I think as network guys we&#39;re going
    to have to get past the &quot;extra hops and unpredictable traffic flows&quot;
    hang up.  The paths and hops look ugly if you look at it from the perspective
    of the physical network, but it&#39;s all perfectly normal from the perspective
    of the virtual network.  The physical network needs to evolve to east-west non-blocking
    architectures to cope with network virtualization.  If the &quot;extra hops&quot;
    are really a problem, we need to be clear on why those are problem, not just &#39;because
    it looks ugly on a drawing&#39;.  If the latency is low and the bandwidth non-blocking,
    why are extra *physical* hops bad?  Just playing devils advocate (kinda) ;-)

  html: Just a thought, how robust is this technology when sites are failing over
    and chaos rules. Seems like an outage could cause a disconnect for software to
    recover in a robust fashion.  All for Network Virtualization, need to experiment
    here.  8-)

  html: One of the biggest drawbacks to virtual appliance versions of load balancers
    (or, lovingly, application delivery controllers) is the lack of SSL crypto hardware.
    Most load balancers today employ some type of SSL ASIC to handle the cryptographically
    intensive asymmetric encryption (RSA) that occurs at the start of any SSL/TLS
    connection. <br /><br />Intel recently added AES-NI to its server processor lineup
    (it&#39;s in the new E7&#39;s and 5600 series Xeon), however they only handle
    symmetric, not asymmetric. <br /><br />So as Ivan said, it&#39;s going to chew
    up a lot more CPU cycles than would otherwise be chewed.

  html: Well, I wouldn&#39;t use VXLAN (or any other L2 technology) between data centers.
    It&#39;s a nice mechanism to implement many virtual segments within a single failure
    domain (availability zone), if you want to go beyond that, you need proper application
    architecture.

  html: The &quot;only&quot; reasons I dislike spaghetti-like virtual flows are:<br
    /><br />(A) troubleshooting complexities<br />(B) increased network utilization<br
    /><br />I don&#39;t really care about N/S shifting to E/W. That&#39;s happening
    anyway and needs to be solved, but wasting bandwidth is a different story.<br
    /><br />Of course, if you have too much bandwidth in your DC and too many CPU
    cycles (so you can do routing in VM appliances), you might not care.

  html: Interesting comment, especially in light of how much my System Admins would
    love the same subnets at both our data centers.  Is there a good solution for
    allowing hosts to migrate between data centers that don&#39;t share layer-2 adjacency
    via any technology (VLAN, VxLAN, etc)?  Maybe LISP?

  html: "Ivan, while I (and probably 99% of network engineers) dislike spaghetti flows\
    \ exactly for the reasons you mentioned, I agree with Brad\u2019s point here.\
    \  In virtualized / cloud environments we are going to see fewer and fewer \u201C\
    clean\u201D designs (as depicted on the left side of your diagram), with well\
    \ separated roles aligned with the physical network topology.  The network paths\
    \ should be deterministic (moving virtual appliances around as load changes =&gt;\
    \ not necessarily a good idea) and performance (incl. latency) needs to be kept\
    \ under control, but otherwise I would not care about the number of physical hops.<br\
    \ /><br />I think we\u2019re more likely to see a shared/virtualized pool of physical\
    \ appliances (loadbalancers with SSL, firewalls, etc), connected to the \u201C\
    network fabric\u201D somewhat like service linecards in a 6500 chassis (and hopefully\
    \ supporting VXLAN termination natively at some point to avoid the L2 issues you\
    \ described).<br /><br />Still, VXLAN termination in hardware may help keep the\
    \ spaghetti slightly less convoluted."

  html: Read this post first http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/09/long-distance-vmotion-for-disaster.html,
    and discuss the cost issue with the server admins ;)<br /><br />Once implemented
    properly, LISP will solve the IP address mobility problem, but not all the others.

  html: According to Cisco insiders, ASA Firewall will implement VXLAN to VLAN Gateway
    mecanisms. <br />But when, and on which type of ASA ?

    html: Louis, the product information is totally out-of-date. Read more recent
      VXLAN posts for some details, will publish a comprehensive overview in near
      future.<br /><br />However, I wouldn&#39;t go down the VXLAN-VLAN-FW path (although
      you could). Why don&#39;t you virtualize the firewall?

  html: 'Ivan, is this still relevant to today&#39;s date? I have a datacenter which
    is currently using VRF to separate routing tables for different environments.
    They route out to their own environment&#39;s firewalls. I was thinking about
    using VXLAN to remove the VRF and VLAN configuration - but this would be an issue
    since they want to use their existing gear. '
