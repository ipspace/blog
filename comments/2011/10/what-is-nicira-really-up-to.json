      "html": "Nicira has the same problem that VXLAN has...there is no native switch-router that talks this protocol where you can &quot;escape the cloud&quot; and bridge to a native VLAN/switch environment. Once our major network vendors provide a &quot;interface vlan\\n switchport vxlan(or openflow) &lt;identifier&gt;&quot;, that might be a &quot;killer app&quot;. Until then, we dream of MPLS-speaking vSwitchRouters. :-)&lt;/identifier&gt;",

      "html": "It just might be possible to get hardware termination of GRE tunnels working (need to check the encapsulation OVS uses), but since GRE tunnels mostly get implemented as point-to-point interfaces, the configuration would be a major beast.<br /><br />However, if you&#39;re a cloud provider, you might not care - you give the customer the option of running yet another VM instance to do L3 routing or firewalling (like VMware does with vShield Edge). I still think virtual appliances are suboptimal, but you really don&#39;t care if you charge them by CPU cycles spent and the customers are willing to pay for that.",
