      "html": "Nice, back to fundamentals! :) It is probably worth noting the difference between circuits (deterministic multiplexing), packet switching (stochastic multiplexing) and virtual-circuits. With circuits being the simplest of them all, we may presume they would be most scalable too ;) Indeed, scalability has to do with the *growth rate of the shared state in the network*. The reason that makes virtual circuits attractive is traffic engineering, which requires a lot of shared state in the network for explicit path selection (p2p). Hence the scalability problems. <br /><br />Interestingly enough, it is possible to implement similar granular traffic engineering with packet switching only, and get same blow up in shared network state. This could be left as an exercise to the readers :) Packet switching does keep network state in the core, just less granular as compared to virtual circuits (and there are serious problems in scale-free topologies). Now coming back to circuit switching, where the amount of network state is fixed in hardware - how comes we are stuck with expensive, poorly scalable packet switches in the network cores ;)",

I would believe that the term  tunnel would be used loosely here. <br /><br />The classical defacto term of tunnel in the IP world was GRE type or IP packet in IP(regardless if encrypted or not) packet meaning the inner packet had no clue or was ever exposed to the outside and the de encapsulated packets at endpoints had no idea of the amount of &quot;hops&quot; traversed. So to an endpoint the trace route is 2 hops yet it really traversed 2+. But in that little wedge L2.5 world that IP packet is fully exposed and even though the upper label is processed there is still a chance for a &quot;punt&quot; and the packet is still exposed. Yet we are using labels as &quot;virtual tunnels&quot; etc. The trace route is still 2 hops to the endpoints through the &quot;cloud&quot; due to MBGP/VRF/VPN mechanics etc)  Just Semantics. We can split the nomenclature hairs on protocol function to whatever we want these days with the types of &quot;tunneling&quot; or &quot;encapsulation&quot; features we have available today(as Ivan mentioned).  Great post by Ivan always a great read.. <br /><br />So instead of splitting hairs why not split tunneling(oh that was bad) ;)",

Another potential definition of tunneling which was kind of hinted at during the discussion was if the core devices (P routers) are unable to understand/forward the tunneled/encapsulated protocol information when it is decapsulated then it is tunneling.  E.g. L3 VPN is tunneling because if the P routers removed the MPLS labels they would not know where to forward the IP packet contained within as they do not have the correct routing information.<br /><br />I&#39;m currently trying to come up with a definition for VPN, hence the interest in the subject area.  So far I&#39;ve managed to deduce that almost everything is VPN!",
