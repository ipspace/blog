  html: That just shows Dells dedication to innovation. I don&#39;t see unicorn tears
    anywhere on Cisco, Juniper, or HPs road map. I think we can all agree that &quot;network
    virtualization&quot; and the data center of the future will NOT happen unless
    everyone gets on board with the UTSDN (Unicorn Tears Software Defined Networking)
    standard.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I got pointed to this piece you have written.<br /><br
    />You have talked about the HP VXLAN piece that I have written above being from
    marketing departments. You may first want to know I am not into marketing but
    engineering. I have given technical points to the discussion from where I see
    it, and if you see the feeds on twitter, discussions on IETF and linkedin you
    would know what I am talking about.<br /><br />I would think you seem to be marketing
    your blog with a lot os sensationalism without even reading the details of the
    blog or the comments posted their in (or even reading the title of the author
    and declaring the team he belongs to). If you really think you have some technical
    knowledge let us have a technical discussion on the ARMD list where all these
    technologies have been discussed. http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/armd/current/maillist.html<br
    /><br />Thanks,<br />Vishwas

  html: BTW Ivan you may notice on the ARMD list I pointed to already has most of
    the discussions on NVGRE and VXLAN much before the blog you point to got published.
    Have a look at http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/armd/current/msg00250.html
    and following discussions.<br /><br />BTW I would love to hear if you still think
    I am in the marketing department. :)

  html: To be honest, I&#39;m so sick and tired of vendors&#39; positioning games
    that I made a wrong assumption. Fixed.  <br /> <br />You might be surprised to
    learn that I actually agree with the technical details of your argument, but find
    it irrelevant, because  <br /> <br />(A) we yet have to see a shipping EVB products  <br
    />(B) VXLAN, NVGRE and OpenFlow/GRE solutions bypass the VLAN limitations and
    many of the bridging reliability/scalability issues.  <br /> <br />I also hope
    you formed your opinion of my blog and my writing style by reading more than a
    single paragraph that you found offending. If, after reading my EVB/VXLAN/virtualization/data
    center-related posts you still think I&#39;m a sensationalist with no clue what
    I&#39;m writing about, so be it.  <br /> <br />Kind regards,  <br />Ivan

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I dug in deeper into other blog posts and I agree I found
    some good technical discussions on the same. It is also great we agree technically
    on things.<br /><br />First to answer your questions:<br /><br />(A) Not yet shiping
    product does not necessarily mean it is vaporware.<br />(B)  Note the VLAN limitations
    (&lt;4094) do not necessarily need a seperate tag (though it may be a simpler
    solution). Also note we need some mapping tables to map into instances, if we
    add more intelligence in the mapping tables we can get more instances in the cloud
    though not on a particular switch (think of 2 devices that never talk to each
    other - we do not need seperation at the higher layer between them). Like I mentioned
    engineering approaches have their tradeoffs and that is what I have been trying
    to bring out.<br /><br />With that said you have to note that the blog is not
    an announcement of a product (where you can announce it as marketingl), but about
    comparison of technologies.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Vishwas

  html: 'Let&#39;s start with (B): If you read the EVB description here: http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/05/edge-virtual-bridging-evb-8021qbg-eases.html,
    you&#39;ll notice I&#39;m well-aware of VDP capabilities and the GroupID field
    in the VDP messages ... and I&#39;m actually promoting EVB as the best layer-2
    hypervisor-to-switch integration technology that allows you to grow beyond VLAN
    limits.<br /><br />What I was actually referring to were the fundamental limitations
    of bridging (example: flooding of unicasts). They might be addressable with SPB/TRILL
    combined with PBB, but it&#39;s way simpler to use existing IP transport than
    to introduce so many new technologies in your network. See also this post: http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/05/complexity-belongs-to-network-edge.html<br
    /><br />As for (A), you&#39;ll see me change my mind when I see a hypervisor switch
    supporting VDP. I&#39;ve heard too many (so far empty) &quot;we will support X
    once it&#39;s ratified&quot; promises from a certain vendor that we both know
    only too well.'

  html: Hey Ivan,<br /><br />Here is a way to achieve multi-tenancy (with greater
    than &gt; 4094), using the same UDP/ GRE encapsulation without any propritory
    extensions and using an IP network.<br /><br />http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/armd/current/msg00287.html<br
    /><br />You can assume the text is written solely for your blog. :)<br /><br />Thanks,<br

  html: Have a look at the thread I have pointed, you get it all with a few limitations.
    :) Let me know your views on the same.

  html: You still have to coordinate VLAN numbers with the virtualization platform.
    Could be made to work, but would require extensive orchestration like the various
    Carrier Ethernet-related ideas. Separating virtualization platforms and transport
    networks with IP is a much cleaner approach.<br /><br />Anyhow, I&#39;ve sent
    you a LinkedIn invite, let&#39;s continue the discussion with email.
