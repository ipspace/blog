BGP attributes when you \u201ccreate\u201d a new entry in the BGP table. For instance you can change MED, ORIGIN, LOCAL_PREF, (even weight, which is not a BGP attribute), but not AS_PATH.  Curiuosly, when you use the \u201cnetwork\u2026 mask \u2026\u201d  command with a route-map setting \u201cas-path prepend \u2026\u201d you do not get any error message, but if you do the same with \u201caggregate-address \u2026\u201d and \u201credistribute \u2026\u201d you get the following error message \u201c % &quot;ROUTE-MAP-name&quot; used as BGP attribute route-map, set as-path prepend not supported\u201d .  I think  that guys from Cisco should fix it up, for otherwise people make mistakes such the one you reported in your post.",

      "html": "(FOLLOW-UP FROM MY PREVIOUS COMMENT)<br />Moreover, as a general  personal consideration about IOS style to inject prefixes in a BGP process, I think IOS has a clumsy way to do it.  Summarizing, in IOS you may use three different methods:<br />- Manual, through the &quot;network ... mask ...&quot; command. You may associate to this command a route-map to change some attributes (es. MED) of the route inserted in the BGP table.<br />- Through aggregation through the &quot;aggregate-address ...&quot; command.<br />- Through redistribution.<br />This generates different methods to inject the same prefix in a BGP process, leading some time to different  BGP attributes. Let me make an example. Suppose you have a directly connected network that you want to inject in a BGP process. You may do it using the &quot;network ... mask ...&quot; command or the \u201credistribute connected\u201d command (with a route-map if you want to inject only the directly connected network we are examining). Both ways produce the same result with a small difference: if you use the &quot;network ... mask ...&quot; command the ORIGIN attribute is set to IGP, using \u201credistribute connected\u201d command the ORIGIN attribute is set to INCOMPLETE. Does this make any sense ? In my opinion surely no ! To tell the truth, I do not even understand why IOS sets the ORIGIN to different values when you use the &quot;network ... mask ...&quot; and the &quot;aggregate-address ...&quot; commands (ORIGIN = IGP) and redistribution (ORIGIN = INCOMPLETE). Probably there are historical reasons behind that, but I do not think today this makes any sense, and this can lead you to errors since ORIGIN is part of the BGP selection process (to be sincere, I have the crazy idea that ORIGIN attribute is useless and should be taken out from BGP selection process !!!)<br />If you compare IOS to JUNOS, JUNOS has only one (unified) way to inject prefixes into a BGP process, which is essentially similar to the redistribution process used by IOS.  You put in some way the prefix you want to inject in the BGP process in the routing table (be it a directly connected route, an aggregate route or route advertised by a dynamic routing protocol), create an \u201cexport routing policy\u201d and then apply it to a BGP session (or a group of BGP sessions).  Going back to AS_PATH prepending, you cannot make any mistake, you have only one way to do it, just use the \u201cas-path prepend \u2026\u201d command as one of the possible actions in the \u201cexport routing policy\u201d. At last, JUNOS always sets the ORIGIN attribute to IGP (giving you a knob if you want to change it).",

      "html": "There&#39;s a simple reason for so many methods - history ;)<br /><br />You have to remember that BGP existed in Cisco IOS long before there were route maps (and probably before there were redistribution filters). Also, BGP was used in an environment where they cared about control and stability (so listing the networks manually made perfect sense).<br /><br />Aggregation was an add-on feature (as BGP moved from classful BGP-3 to classless BGP-4) and was initially designed as a proxy functionality - a router would aggregate prefixes from other routers running BGP-3 and thus being unable to aggregate. The BGP-3 to BGP-4 migration is also where the &quot;summary-only&quot; keyword came from. Nobody was willing to just aggregate and hope that it would work - the classful prefixes were left in the BGP table as a safety measure.<br /><br />And we all know that once you implement a feature, it&#39;s impossible to get rid of it, because there&#39;s always at least one huge network out there that relies on that feature and would break if you change the way the feature behaves.<br /><br />Comparing that to Junos is unfair. It&#39;s like comparing OS/370 to Linux  :-P",

      "html": "And finally, the ORIGIN attribute. It&#39;s a leftover from the days when the Internet had to migrate from EGP to BGP and it was important to know whether a route is a native BGP route (originated in BGP and transported to the current router only through BGP) or an EGP route redistributed into BGP. Native BGP routes would obviously be preferred over EGP routes. See http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1268#section-5<br /><br />BTW, the &quot;Incomplete&quot; ORIGIN is a misnomer. It should be &quot;Unknown&quot;.<br /><br />Also, might actually make sense to set ORIGIN to &quot;Incomplete&quot; on route redistribution (unless you use a route-map to set it to IGP). If one router advertises a prefix with a NETWORK statement and another one through blind redistribution, it&#39;s better to listen to the one that (supposedly) knows what it&#39;s doing.<br /><br />Do we still need the ORIGIN attribute? Probably not, but as I said before, there&#39;s probably a huge network out there that relies on ORIGIN for proper route selection  :-P",

The task was simple, apply the no-export community to a prefix. For whatever reason my first instinct was to apply the route-map using the network command, well the prefix just did not get sent to the neighbor. Ran few tests, repeated the command this time just settin a test community nn:nn and the prefix gets passed along with the correct community, tried again with the no-export, nothing, no prefixes on neighbor. Apply the route-map to the neighbor command and the prefix gets passed on with the correct community of no-export.<br />I found this even more confusing, you can pass some community but no others, there must be a fundamental programming/desing reason for this, it woudl be very good to know it so it can be understood and retained by my poor brain.
