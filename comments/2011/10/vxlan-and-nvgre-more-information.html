            <div class="comment-content">That just shows Dells dedication to innovation. I don&#39;t see unicorn tears anywhere on Cisco, Juniper, or HPs road map. I think we can all agree that &quot;network virtualization&quot; and the data center of the future will NOT happen unless everyone gets on board with the UTSDN (Unicorn Tears Software Defined Networking) standard.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I got pointed to this piece you have written.<br /><br />You have talked about the HP VXLAN piece that I have written above being from marketing departments. You may first want to know I am not into marketing but engineering. I have given technical points to the discussion from where I see it, and if you see the feeds on twitter, discussions on IETF and linkedin you would know what I am talking about.<br /><br />I would think you seem to be marketing your blog with a lot os sensationalism without even reading the details of the blog or the comments posted their in (or even reading the title of the author and declaring the team he belongs to). If you really think you have some technical knowledge let us have a technical discussion on the ARMD list where all these technologies have been discussed. http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/armd/current/maillist.html<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Vishwas</div>

            <div class="comment-content">BTW Ivan you may notice on the ARMD list I pointed to already has most of the discussions on NVGRE and VXLAN much before the blog you point to got published. Have a look at http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/armd/current/msg00250.html and following discussions.<br /><br />BTW I would love to hear if you still think I am in the marketing department. :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">To be honest, I&#39;m so sick and tired of vendors&#39; positioning games that I made a wrong assumption. Fixed.  <br /> <br />You might be surprised to learn that I actually agree with the technical details of your argument, but find it irrelevant, because  <br /> <br />(A) we yet have to see a shipping EVB products  <br />(B) VXLAN, NVGRE and OpenFlow/GRE solutions bypass the VLAN limitations and many of the bridging reliability/scalability issues.  <br /> <br />I also hope you formed your opinion of my blog and my writing style by reading more than a single paragraph that you found offending. If, after reading my EVB/VXLAN/virtualization/data center-related posts you still think I&#39;m a sensationalist with no clue what I&#39;m writing about, so be it.  <br /> <br />Kind regards,  <br />Ivan</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I dug in deeper into other blog posts and I agree I found some good technical discussions on the same. It is also great we agree technically on things.<br /><br />First to answer your questions:<br /><br />(A) Not yet shiping product does not necessarily mean it is vaporware.<br />(B)  Note the VLAN limitations (&lt;4094) do not necessarily need a seperate tag (though it may be a simpler solution). Also note we need some mapping tables to map into instances, if we add more intelligence in the mapping tables we can get more instances in the cloud though not on a particular switch (think of 2 devices that never talk to each other - we do not need seperation at the higher layer between them). Like I mentioned engineering approaches have their tradeoffs and that is what I have been trying to bring out.<br /><br />With that said you have to note that the blog is not an announcement of a product (where you can announce it as marketingl), but about comparison of technologies.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Vishwas</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Let&#39;s start with (B): If you read the EVB description here: http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/05/edge-virtual-bridging-evb-8021qbg-eases.html, you&#39;ll notice I&#39;m well-aware of VDP capabilities and the GroupID field in the VDP messages ... and I&#39;m actually promoting EVB as the best layer-2 hypervisor-to-switch integration technology that allows you to grow beyond VLAN limits.<br /><br />What I was actually referring to were the fundamental limitations of bridging (example: flooding of unicasts). They might be addressable with SPB/TRILL combined with PBB, but it&#39;s way simpler to use existing IP transport than to introduce so many new technologies in your network. See also this post: http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/05/complexity-belongs-to-network-edge.html<br /><br />As for (A), you&#39;ll see me change my mind when I see a hypervisor switch supporting VDP. I&#39;ve heard too many (so far empty) &quot;we will support X once it&#39;s ratified&quot; promises from a certain vendor that we both know only too well.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hey Ivan,<br /><br />Here is a way to achieve multi-tenancy (with greater than &gt; 4094), using the same UDP/ GRE encapsulation without any propritory extensions and using an IP network.<br /><br />http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/armd/current/msg00287.html<br /><br />You can assume the text is written solely for your blog. :)<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Vishwas</div>
