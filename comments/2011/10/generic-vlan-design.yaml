  html: I would go back to him and say:<br /><br />* Cars generally have 4 wheels.<br
    />* Trucks often have upwards of 18 wheels.<br />* Having only 4 wheels gives
    you less tires to change but you wouldn&#39;t build a semi-trailer with just 4
    wheels.

  html: F) All of the above.<br /><br />&quot;Small is beautiful, go with 15 VLANs
    but then again, bigger is better so use 70 VLANs.  More VLANs will definitely
    increase your job security so it really depends.  42 would be best.&quot;<br />Whatever
    you choose we want a follow up post!! haha

  html: I think you should reply to use 15 base vlans and then encapsulate an additional
    3 q-in-q vlans in 5 of those and 4 in the remaining 10 that way you have both
    15 and 70 vlans.<br /><br />70 - 15 overlay vlans = 55 needed q-in-q inside vlans<br
    />(5 * 3) + (10 * 4) = 55<br /><br />That way you can answer yes to both of his
    solutions

    problem, it&#39;s really easy to narrow it down the device.

  html: I got the fun part of the blog post... yes I gave it a good smile and I honestly
    understand your point.<br /><br />Nevertheless I think you could have skipped
    this one (post). But hey it&#39;s your blog, posts are not always just for the
    readers, and guess what I (reader) read it from top to bottom and I had some fun.<br
    /><br />So here&#39;s my 2 cents reply with:<br /><br />Search and Replace VLANs,
    servers, switches with &quot;chickens, rabbits and chick peas&quot;. Can&#39;t
    really tell you how many chick peas you need for the rabbits nor if the rabbits
    can dance with more than one chicken.

    by people asking for design advice for free...I just have to ask - are we really
    still just limiting 100 hosts to a segment?  Have I taken bad advice from the
    Cisco/VMWare VCE design team in planning upgrading from /25s to /22s?  So sorry
    if this post is offensive because of the original topic.

  html: Will, it&#39;s actually about people asking me to do their job for free. Asking
    for a specific advice after you did your homework is perfectly fine. Has always
    been and will always be.<br /><br />/22 is not bad, but I try to be on the safe
    side. If I don&#39;t have to have big subnets, I try to avoid them.<br /><br />Remember
    that one subnet = one security zone (unless you have VM-level firewall like VSG
    or vShield App). If you have 1000 hosts in one security zone, then /22 might fit
    the bill, otherwise it&#39;s a waste of addresses.<br /><br />Makes sense?<br

  html: I think you should just point him to this post (which he has probably seen
    already anyway) and tell him to derive his answer from the collective wisdom of
    the group.  If that doesn&#39;t work, send him an invoice for a few hours consulting
    and see if he pays it, then  help out.  Or, send him to a recruiter and recommend
    he hire a network guy.<br /><br />By the way, we have a similar environment (about
    100 physical servers (lots of VM) and 300 desktops) and we run about 35 vlans.  Of
    course, that is based on our needs and security zones.... :-)

    one of many trolls out there.<br />* If you&#39;d be interested in my work more
    than just to write a snarky comment, you&#39;d know how many questions I answer
    in public.<br />* You have no idea how many additional questions I answer via
    e-mail.<br />* You also have no idea how many e-mails I get where it&#39;s clearly
    obvious that people are trying to get me to do their job for free. I even answer
    many of them if it/s obvious that the person asking the question did at least
    the basic research;<br />* I publish a few articles each week that one or two
    people find somewhat useful. What have you contributed to other network plumbers
    so far?<br />* Anyone who writes technical articles can probably appreciate how
    much time is spent writing them. Do your math.<br /><br />Finally, yes, I do charge
    for some of my services. Do you have a problem with that?

    prime example.<br /><br />To humbly ask for some advice is one thing, but to ask

    /><br />Thank you for everything you do to contribute to our geeky little community
