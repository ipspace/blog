            <div class="comment-content">You say no VMotion was used, but the article states: <br /><br />&quot;Thursday night I completely failed the core datacenter operations over to the recovery servers using a combination of Veeam Replication and VMware migrations that in the end, really didn’t need to happen.&quot; <br /><br />Of course you can&#39;t tell at the time that it didn&#39;t need to happen, but VMotion was part of the DR plan and COULD have been necessary if conditions were slightly worse.<br /><br />Also, I have a question.  I don&#39;t know exactly how VMotion operates.  Is it possible that the 10 ms RTT restriction might be relaxed in, say, three or four years?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&#39;VMware migration&#39; doesn&#39;t necessarily mean VMotion, and I expect in the context of the article it means a cold migration of a powered-off VM to a new host and new datastore.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">He also says he has 100Mb circuit between sites. vMotion requires at least 600 Mbps (1 Gbps is recommended). It might work over lower-speed links, but not likely (page change rate is too high).<br /><br />As for RTT, it&#39;s actually the bandwidth-delay-product problem. You have to copy memory pages to the other vSphere host faster than the VM changes them and that&#39;s hard to do if you have low-bandwidth or high-latency link. Can it be done? Sure. Will they do it? I hope not ;)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">vMotion is so cool to see, that it really has set some rough expectation management issues.  <br />  <br />While I do have customers, deploying 10G networks &lt;100KM who plan to do live vMotion the truth is that for most customers pause/stop-&gt;sync-&gt;resume in new location is MORE than enough to meet the business need. And by accepting a 30, 60, even 300s window the complexity level goes WAY down and the distances supported go WAY up. And no unicorns are harmed ;-)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The root cause of the problem is the bandwidth-delay product: how fast can you push memory image across the WAN link while the VM changes its memory. <br /><br />The actual results depend on the BW, delay and VM page change rate. You could probably get reasonable results with WAN acceleration (optimizing TCP and/or compressing vMotion data like F5 is doing) if the VM is not doing anything (in which case, why would you want to move it at all ;) ).</div>
