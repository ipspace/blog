You may first want to know I am not into marketing but engineering. I have given technical points to the discussion from where I see it, and if you see the feeds on twitter, discussions on IETF and linkedin you would know what I am talking about.<br /><br />I would think you seem to be marketing your blog with a lot os sensationalism without even reading the details of the blog or the comments posted their in (or even reading the title of the author and declaring the team he belongs to). If you really think you have some technical knowledge let us have a technical discussion on the ARMD list where all these technologies have been discussed. http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/armd/current/maillist.html<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Vishwas",

Fixed.  <br /> <br />You might be surprised to learn that I actually agree with the technical details of your argument, but find it irrelevant, because  <br /> <br />(A) we yet have to see a shipping EVB products  <br />(B) VXLAN, NVGRE and OpenFlow/GRE solutions bypass the VLAN limitations and many of the bridging reliability/scalability issues.  <br /> <br />I also hope you formed your opinion of my blog and my writing style by reading more than a single paragraph that you found offending. If, after reading my EVB/VXLAN/virtualization/data center-related posts you still think I&#39;m a sensationalist with no clue what I&#39;m writing about, so be it.  <br /> <br />Kind regards,  <br />Ivan",

      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I dug in deeper into other blog posts and I agree I found some good technical discussions on the same. It is also great we agree technically on things.<br /><br />First to answer your questions:<br /><br />(A) Not yet shiping product does not necessarily mean it is vaporware.<br />(B)  Note the VLAN limitations (&lt;4094) do not necessarily need a seperate tag (though it may be a simpler solution). Also note we need some mapping tables to map into instances, if we add more intelligence in the mapping tables we can get more instances in the cloud though not on a particular switch (think of 2 devices that never talk to each other - we do not need seperation at the higher layer between them). Like I mentioned engineering approaches have their tradeoffs and that is what I have been trying to bring out.<br /><br />With that said you have to note that the blog is not an announcement of a product (where you can announce it as marketingl), but about comparison of technologies.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Vishwas",

They might be addressable with SPB/TRILL combined with PBB, but it&#39;s way simpler to use existing IP transport than to introduce so many new technologies in your network. See also this post: http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/05/complexity-belongs-to-network-edge.html<br /><br />As for (A), you&#39;ll see me change my mind when I see a hypervisor switch supporting VDP. I&#39;ve heard too many (so far empty) &quot;we will support X once it&#39;s ratified&quot; promises from a certain vendor that we both know only too well.",
