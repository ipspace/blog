  html: I quite liked the following summary from Open Networking Summit:<br /><br
    />https://www.networkworld.com/community/node/78975<br /><br />Looks like Cisco
    is &quot;in&quot;.<br /><br />On &quot;what is possible that&#39;s impossible
    now&quot; point - I think I have an example. With OpenFlow you could potentially
    create a multi-tenanted network, where users are given edge ports on one or more
    devices, and total freedom to do whatever they want in regards to how and what
    travels between these ports. Without affecting other tenants.<br /><br />Another
    point that comes to mind is an ability to support arbitrary new protocols, for
    example&#39;s sake IPv7 or whatever. All you need to do is to get your controller
    to understand it; no changes needed on the devices themselves.<br /><br />(Hopefully
    I did get what OpenFlow could potentially do correctly - please let me know if
    I&#39;m off the mark)

  html: '&quot;Multi-tenant network&quot; - the same thing can be done today with
    VPLS, MAC-in-MAC or (in virtual world) any IP tunneling mechanism (NVGRE, VXLAN
    ...). You know that better than I do ;) If someone wants centralized control plane,
    there&#39;s always PBB-TE :-E<br /><br />Arbitrary new protocols - not before
    OpenFlow becomes a generic pattern matching mechanism. Today you can match on
    MAC, 802.1Q, MPLS or IP fields (not even IPv6). Nicira has some pattern matching
    extensions, but they&#39;re proprietary (isn&#39;t the world of emerging standards
    beautiful 8-) )<br /><br />However, it&#39;s pretty hard to implement generic
    pattern matching in existing hardware tailored to the needs of MAC- and IPv4/IPv6
    forwarding.'

  html: '&gt; VPLS, MAC-in-MAC<br /><br />These share a single control plane, so not
    much freedom to choose how data travels between the edge ports. OpenFlow, on other
    hand, from what I understand, allows somewhat organised anarchy in the control
    plane department.<br /><br />Question: does OpenFlow today has hooks into physical
    layer state changes (like loss of light or carrier)? (Yes, I could read the specs
    and figure it myself, but I&#39;m lazy, or a bit busy right now, or both) ;)<br
    /><br />&gt; not before OpenFlow becomes a generic pattern matching mechanism<br
    /><br />Hope this is a part of the plan. And yes, I realise this will likely require
    forklift upgrade, but hopefully where market needs lead, the R&amp;D shall follow.
    Either that, or you can&#39;t deny man a hope! :) (That&#39;s whole lot of &quot;hopes&quot;
    in one paragraph, but hey - it&#39;s Friday!) :)'

  html: '&quot;Choose how data travels between edge ports&quot; - you don&#39;t want
    to know how complex that would be to implement in multi-tenant OpenFlow networks.
    Probably as &quot;simple&quot; as MPLS-TP or PBB-TE.<br /><br />Need to go back
    to the docs, but I do remember seeing some hooks for fast reroute after physical
    layer state change.'

  html: '&gt; you don&#39;t want to know how complex that would be...<br /><br />You&#39;re
    right, I don&#39;t! :) But, isn&#39;t it exactly what SDN proponents are promising
    us - hiding all this horrible complexity under layers of abstraction, the same
    way it has happened in programming?'
