      "html": "Openflow (at least 1.0) probably best compares to Tcl, with C++ being noteworthy for its heavyweight complexity ;) In my opinion, the main selling point for Openflow in large-scale (100k+ servers) data-centers is significant simplification (if not complete reduction) of network control plane. Complex, multi-vendor software is the main barrier on the way to unified automation and improved network stability. In a highly-specialized networks, such as simple symmetric full-bisection bandwidth topologies, feature richness of common control/management plane stacks becomes unnecessary, more likely turning into source of software bugs and operational headache. On the &quot;innovation&quot; side, being praised by Openflow adepts, large scale networks would probably mostly benefit from advanced, automated, troubleshooting tools not found in modern IP networks.",
