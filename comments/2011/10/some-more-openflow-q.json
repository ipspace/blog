      "html": "I quite liked the following summary from Open Networking Summit:<br /><br />https://www.networkworld.com/community/node/78975<br /><br />Looks like Cisco is &quot;in&quot;.<br /><br />On &quot;what is possible that&#39;s impossible now&quot; point - I think I have an example. With OpenFlow you could potentially create a multi-tenanted network, where users are given edge ports on one or more devices, and total freedom to do whatever they want in regards to how and what travels between these ports. Without affecting other tenants.<br /><br />Another point that comes to mind is an ability to support arbitrary new protocols, for example&#39;s sake IPv7 or whatever. All you need to do is to get your controller to understand it; no changes needed on the devices themselves.<br /><br />(Hopefully I did get what OpenFlow could potentially do correctly - please let me know if I&#39;m off the mark)",

      "html": "&quot;Multi-tenant network&quot; - the same thing can be done today with VPLS, MAC-in-MAC or (in virtual world) any IP tunneling mechanism (NVGRE, VXLAN ...). You know that better than I do ;) If someone wants centralized control plane, there&#39;s always PBB-TE :-E<br /><br />Arbitrary new protocols - not before OpenFlow becomes a generic pattern matching mechanism. Today you can match on MAC, 802.1Q, MPLS or IP fields (not even IPv6). Nicira has some pattern matching extensions, but they&#39;re proprietary (isn&#39;t the world of emerging standards beautiful 8-) )<br /><br />However, it&#39;s pretty hard to implement generic pattern matching in existing hardware tailored to the needs of MAC- and IPv4/IPv6 forwarding.",

      "html": "&gt; VPLS, MAC-in-MAC<br /><br />These share a single control plane, so not much freedom to choose how data travels between the edge ports. OpenFlow, on other hand, from what I understand, allows somewhat organised anarchy in the control plane department.<br /><br />Question: does OpenFlow today has hooks into physical layer state changes (like loss of light or carrier)? (Yes, I could read the specs and figure it myself, but I&#39;m lazy, or a bit busy right now, or both) ;)<br /><br />&gt; not before OpenFlow becomes a generic pattern matching mechanism<br /><br />Hope this is a part of the plan. And yes, I realise this will likely require forklift upgrade, but hopefully where market needs lead, the R&amp;D shall follow. Either that, or you can&#39;t deny man a hope! :) (That&#39;s whole lot of &quot;hopes&quot; in one paragraph, but hey - it&#39;s Friday!) :)",

Probably as &quot;simple&quot; as MPLS-TP or PBB-TE.<br /><br />Need to go back to the docs, but I do remember seeing some hooks for fast reroute after physical layer state change.",
