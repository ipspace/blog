Make it look like a PPP connection. Wouldn&#39;t it be better to keep the separation at layer 2? And with IP all the way to the edge, there is no issue of scaling VLANs either.<br /><br />(Yeah, I know I&#39;m ranting, but I do very much dislike the N:1 VLAN model... :-))",

      "html": "As weird as it may seem, I like the PPPoE solution. When I was working at Algar (1999/2002) we were probably the first company to adopt PPPoE for broadband here in Brazil. At the same time Telefonica tried using DHCP with the Cisco 6000, and it was a nightmare. We launched our ADSL service at the same time, and after a couple years everyone was using PPPoE. The main advantages are not strictly technical though, but that (1) it maps to the telco mindset (PPPoE sessions behave as circuits after all) and (2) it makes it easy to implement billing and other administrative controls. On the tech side, it also allows to keep switch configuration to a minimum, which makes maintenance much easier than if you need to actually configure port by port, user by user. The cost is that you need an expensive box to deal with all the sessions, but Moore law is in our favor. I believe that&#39;s still the best way to handle ISP traffic.<br /><br />As an aside, at the time (2000 I think) we designed a solution where we could use PPPoE to serve two customers in the same home with two separate services. For example, one PPPoE tunnel could be used to deliver video and the other one would be a plain Internet connection. However, we never launched this and I don&#39;t know of any provider who sets up this kind of solution though.",
