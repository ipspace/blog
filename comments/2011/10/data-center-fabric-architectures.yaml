  html: 'This left me wanting on one more topic: what about the number of VLANs supported
    by each? Which ones are limited to 4K? Which ones are not and have or can have
    port-local VLAN IDs?'

  html: Super great slide show.  Thanks a lot for sharing.  I didnt quite get why
    FCOE is a must....all that buys is less cabling/equipment right?  Is it a must
    for any other reason?

  html: Can&#39;t put everything on the slides or they would be too crowded. It&#39;s
    primarily to reduce server-to-ToR cabling and the number of managed devices (no
    need for ToR FC switch).
