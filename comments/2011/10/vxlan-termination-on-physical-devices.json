      "html": "Ivan, just thinking out load here but I think as network guys we&#39;re going to have to get past the &quot;extra hops and unpredictable traffic flows&quot; hang up.  The paths and hops look ugly if you look at it from the perspective of the physical network, but it&#39;s all perfectly normal from the perspective of the virtual network.  The physical network needs to evolve to east-west non-blocking architectures to cope with network virtualization.  If the &quot;extra hops&quot; are really a problem, we need to be clear on why those are problem, not just &#39;because it looks ugly on a drawing&#39;.  If the latency is low and the bandwidth non-blocking, why are extra *physical* hops bad?  Just playing devils advocate (kinda) ;-)",

      "html": "One of the biggest drawbacks to virtual appliance versions of load balancers (or, lovingly, application delivery controllers) is the lack of SSL crypto hardware. Most load balancers today employ some type of SSL ASIC to handle the cryptographically intensive asymmetric encryption (RSA) that occurs at the start of any SSL/TLS connection. <br /><br />Intel recently added AES-NI to its server processor lineup (it&#39;s in the new E7&#39;s and 5600 series Xeon), however they only handle symmetric, not asymmetric. <br /><br />So as Ivan said, it&#39;s going to chew up a lot more CPU cycles than would otherwise be chewed.",

      "html": "Ivan, while I (and probably 99% of network engineers) dislike spaghetti flows exactly for the reasons you mentioned, I agree with Brad\u2019s point here.  In virtualized / cloud environments we are going to see fewer and fewer \u201cclean\u201d designs (as depicted on the left side of your diagram), with well separated roles aligned with the physical network topology.  The network paths should be deterministic (moving virtual appliances around as load changes =&gt; not necessarily a good idea) and performance (incl. latency) needs to be kept under control, but otherwise I would not care about the number of physical hops.<br /><br />I think we\u2019re more likely to see a shared/virtualized pool of physical appliances (loadbalancers with SSL, firewalls, etc), connected to the \u201cnetwork fabric\u201d somewhat like service linecards in a 6500 chassis (and hopefully supporting VXLAN termination natively at some point to avoid the L2 issues you described).<br /><br />Still, VXLAN termination in hardware may help keep the spaghetti slightly less convoluted.",
