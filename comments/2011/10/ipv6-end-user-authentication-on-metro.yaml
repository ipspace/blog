    to authenticate the CPE?

  html: Do you really think the IPv4 solution is the best one? Pretending to create
    customer isolation by a combination of DHCP snooping, ARP inspection and other
    layer-violating hacks? Make it look like a PPP connection. Wouldn&#39;t it be
    better to keep the separation at layer 2? And with IP all the way to the edge,
    there is no issue of scaling VLANs either.<br /><br />(Yeah, I know I&#39;m ranting,
    but I do very much dislike the N:1 VLAN model... :-))

    with National Broadband Network&#39;s FTTP deployment.

  html: You can authenticate the CPE (or host) with 802.1x, but you cannot prevent
    it from using a spoofed IPv6 source address and you don&#39;t know which IPv6
    address a host is using. <br /><br />Also, it&#39;s probably perfectly possible
    to match 802.1x data, CPE MAC address, and DUID in DHCPv6 IA_PD request to figure
    out which prefix a user got ... but definitely not trivial.

  html: As I wrote, it makes me sad. I would love to see a network with no VLANs,
    only L3 switches and perfectly static configuration ... but do tell me, how many
    Cisco&#39;s ME access switches supports IPv6 at wire speed?  :-P

    the assumption that if CPE is authenticated, then it is under SP&#39;s control
    and thus implicitly trusted.'

  html: Interesting perspective. If you allow only SP-managed CPEs (and they have
    semi-decent security), then you have pretty secure network almost by definition.
    Is that still a viable business model? The same idea was busted in the phone networks
    decades ago.

  html: I am certainly talking from a fairly isolated experience, which is local ISPs
    with HFC networks only allow CPE that they have supplied, configured and controlling
    themselves. And while it&#39;s not the case with DSL, the upcoming FTTH network
    (NBN) follows the same model - CPE comes with and forms an integral part of the
    service.

  html: As weird as it may seem, I like the PPPoE solution. When I was working at
    Algar (1999/2002) we were probably the first company to adopt PPPoE for broadband
    here in Brazil. At the same time Telefonica tried using DHCP with the Cisco 6000,
    and it was a nightmare. We launched our ADSL service at the same time, and after
    a couple years everyone was using PPPoE. The main advantages are not strictly
    technical though, but that (1) it maps to the telco mindset (PPPoE sessions behave
    as circuits after all) and (2) it makes it easy to implement billing and other
    administrative controls. On the tech side, it also allows to keep switch configuration
    to a minimum, which makes maintenance much easier than if you need to actually
    configure port by port, user by user. The cost is that you need an expensive box
    to deal with all the sessions, but Moore law is in our favor. I believe that&#39;s
    still the best way to handle ISP traffic.<br /><br />As an aside, at the time
    (2000 I think) we designed a solution where we could use PPPoE to serve two customers
    in the same home with two separate services. For example, one PPPoE tunnel could
    be used to deliver video and the other one would be a plain Internet connection.
    However, we never launched this and I don&#39;t know of any provider who sets
    up this kind of solution though.

  html: how about just forgetting about dhcp altogether, and use a fixed ipv6 block
    per user that you can easily setup in the switch.
