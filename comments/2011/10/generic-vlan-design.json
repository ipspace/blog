If that doesn&#39;t work, send him an invoice for a few hours consulting and see if he pays it, then  help out.  Or, send him to a recruiter and recommend he hire a network guy.<br /><br />By the way, we have a similar environment (about 100 physical servers (lots of VM) and 300 desktops) and we run about 35 vlans.  Of course, that is based on our needs and security zones.... :-)",

Did you ever ask questions during your career? Do you feel bad for not paying for replies? Can I ridicule you for double standards?<br /><br />You&#39;re too greedy and elitist for a network plumber.",

I even answer many of them if it/s obvious that the person asking the question did at least the basic research;<br />* I publish a few articles each week that one or two people find somewhat useful. What have you contributed to other network plumbers so far?<br />* Anyone who writes technical articles can probably appreciate how much time is spent writing them. Do your math.<br /><br />Finally, yes, I do charge for some of my services. Do you have a problem with that?",
