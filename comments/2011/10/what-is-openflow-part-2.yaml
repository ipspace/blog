  html: Openflow (at least 1.0) probably best compares to Tcl, with C++ being noteworthy
    for its heavyweight complexity ;) In my opinion, the main selling point for Openflow
    in large-scale (100k+ servers) data-centers is significant simplification (if
    not complete reduction) of network control plane. Complex, multi-vendor software
    is the main barrier on the way to unified automation and improved network stability.
    In a highly-specialized networks, such as simple symmetric full-bisection bandwidth
    topologies, feature richness of common control/management plane stacks becomes
    unnecessary, more likely turning into source of software bugs and operational
    headache. On the &quot;innovation&quot; side, being praised by Openflow adepts,
    large scale networks would probably mostly benefit from advanced, automated, troubleshooting
    tools not found in modern IP networks.
