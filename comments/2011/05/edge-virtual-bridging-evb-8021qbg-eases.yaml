  html: 'Great article, Ivan.  I&#39;d encourage you to add &quot;Solution #4 (shipping/future):
    VN-Tag/802.1Qbh&quot;.<br /><br />VN-Tag-to-the-VM is available today in Cisco
    UCS via the use of VM-FEX technology - made up of Palo (P81E VIC) plus VN-Link
    (management plane integration between UCS Manager and vCenter). (Note: not all
    use of VN-Link involves Nexus 1000v. VM-FEX != Nexus 1000v)<br /><br />Summary
    is that VM-FEX is a shipping product that directly addresses the &quot;Challenge&quot;
    at the beginning of the article. Since 802.1Qbh is based on Cisco&#39;s FEX technology
    and is moving along towards ratification very nicely, I think adding this 4th
    solution to your article would be useful to the reader.<br /><br />Again, thanks
    for the article.  Great info.'

    if this is shipping yet.

  html: 'This whole topic makes my head spin....<br /><br />I&#39;m a bit surprised
    you got to nearly the end before you even mentioned VEPA. I think all of these
    techniques potentially could collapse under the weight of their own complexity.  Also,
    from a somewhat narrow networking perspective it all makes great sense, but from
    a broader perspective (i.e. server, storage, apps) it leaves a lot to be desired.
    IMHO, as virtualization densities grow, the hairpin traffic problem is going to
    undermine all of these efforts. <br /><br />My take here: http://blog.vcider.com/2011/01/vepa/'

    May - would not be shipping as yet.

  html: While EVB does make some sense (assuming the virtualization vendors won&#39;t
    see the light and implement proper L3 solution), VEPA is a total kludge. More
    about that &quot;wonderful&quot; technology in an upcoming post.

  html: According to the article Extreme was showing a switch (not sure you can order
    it yet) that claimed to support something similar to 802.1Qbg ... and will eventually
    support 802.1Qbg once it&#39;s ratified. Sounds like FabricPath or VCS to me  :-P<br
    /><br />Furthermore, X8 &quot;is expected to begin customer trials in October
    2011.&quot; Futures, futures, futures  :-E<br /><br />http://investor.extremenetworks.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=575708

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />How do you define the difference between EVB and VEPA?  It&#39;s
    always been my understanding that EVB = the general term for everything VEPA,
    Port Extension, and other related technologies.

  html: VEPA is part of EVB standard. VEPA = ER that cannot perform local switching
    but sends all VM frames to EVB bridge.

    html: No major changes. The only switch supporting VDP seems to be IBM 5000v.
      As for what HP&#39;s vSwitch does, let&#39;s wait till it ships. Everything
      looks great in a glossy PDF.

  html: Hi Ivan, do you know if this situation has changed and VMware vDS now supports
    VDP? If not, what vSwitches support VDP in the market? I know HP 5900v and IBM
    5000v are supposed to. Does OVS? Nexus 1000v? Thanks!
