    top boxes?

  html: question is why was not ipv6  compatible with ipv4, i just cann&#39;t get
    over this overlook, did they believe that every one will accept their candy from
    day one.<br /><br />Just trying to make up for lost chance. It is only hope for
    the old boxes lying in the dust some where, but that will be mostly for devices(routers)
    that are out of sale and support.

  html: Somehow it&#39;s hard to make 128-bit addresses compatible with 32-bit addresses.
    It&#39;s a bit late (and the question is purely academic at the moment), but if
    you have any ideas, write them down.

  html: If you would propose s/useless/mostly useless/ I might reluctantly agree.
    Remember that stateless NAT64 has a very rigid structure of the IPv6 addresses.
    <br /><br />Assume that you have a single Class-C that you can use for mapping
    and that you want to have servers in separate subnets. I could probably design
    a solution, but it would be kludge royale.<br /><br />Interestingly, I had a discussion
    with Tore Anderson as he proposed the exact use case in one of his presentations
    and wanted to use NAT64 in ASR1K to do it. Turned out his design is still conceptual
    and after I pointed out &quot;a few&quot; limitations of addressing structure
    he went like &quot;Are you telling me this will never work&quot; and then &quot;Why
    can&#39;t they just allow me to configure static NAT translation?&quot;<br /><br
    />So, if you have a customer that actually uses stateless NAT64 (not static 4-to-6
    NAT or 4-to-6 LB) to connect IPv4 clients to IPv6 servers, please let me know.
    I would be more than interested to hear (and blog) about them.

  html: If NAT64 is useless, what&#39;s the opinion of the dual stateless (dIVI) translation
    method?

    when I looked at the diagrams in the Wikipedia article.

    html: What will you gain with that? Think about the IPv4 side, not IPv6 side.

  html: Hey Ivan, Great blog.<br /><br />My apologies if i am opening a somewhat old
    thread.<br /><br />I have a slight discrepant opinion about one to one IPv4 to
    IPv6 mapping.<br /><br />Agreed that NAT64 is truly stateless. However you can
    use SLAAC or DHCPv6 to allocate a fixed /64 IPv6 address to the CPE or the End
    users.<br /><br />The rest of the 64 address or the interface identifier can contain
    the converted IPv4 to IPv6 address.<br /><br />What do you think?

    html: 'I should have quoted the SIIT RFC # and then it would still be accurate

      />BTW, when is the &quot;Tore Anderson&quot; SIIT extension in IOS XE shipping?'

    html: That&#39;s coming in XE rel 11. Strictly speaking it&#39;s not so much a
      SIIT extension, but rather a feature allowing non rfc 6052 address formats to
      be mapped using SIIT (rfc 6145)
