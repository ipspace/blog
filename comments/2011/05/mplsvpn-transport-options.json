      "html": "Focusing just on transport - the main reasons to choose IP(VPN)-MPLS(VPN)-MPLS(LDP) over IP(VPN)-MPLS(VPN)-IP would be overhead and frame size. You can squeeze labeled frame in a baby-jumbo (not relevant in the DC).<br /><br />It&#39;s probably also easier/faster to label switch in hardware than to do full IP lookup (although I don&#39;t think the difference is relevant these days).<br /><br />Last but not least, if you use MPLS labeling, you&#39;ll be able to interwork with almost any existing MPLS/VPN gear; some boxes don&#39;t support MPLS-over-mGRE (Cat6500, for example).",
