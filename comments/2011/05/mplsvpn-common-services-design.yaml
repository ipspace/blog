  html: Interesting enough I have just spoken about a similar design with a global
    MPLS provider and they specifically stated they will not put any special import/export
    (and certainly not import/export route-maps) on their PE routers. Their argumentation
    is that they can only provide standard solution which is templated on their PE
    routers, and adding couples &quot;special&quot; lines under my VRFs to 1000+ PE
    routers creates an unmanagable solution for them.....

  html: I work with an enterprise customer that has implemented a self-managed RFC
    4364BGP/MPLS IP VPNs as an overlay an exiting SP&#39;s cloud even though the SP
    offers the same service.  This was to empower the enterprise&#39;s engineers with
    control over routing and VRF isolation.

  html: This is an overly complex and unsupportable approach to shared services. Having
    to touch 650+ PE routers and thousands of VRFs to create a shared services VPN
    is unacceptable. The correct approach is to touch only the &quot;services&quot;
    vrf, and import/export to each RT that you wish to insert the services into. Furthermore,
    a route-map MUST be applied to the services VPN blocking RFC1918 space, as well
    as the default route and any other overlapping prefixes. For examples where the
    shared services VPN is for management and monitoring of CPE devices, there must
    be globally unique addressing between all VPNs for the endpoints that need to
    communicate with the shared services VPN. If we learn the 10.1.1.0/24 prefix from
    20 customers, hosts in those networks will be unable to use shared services.

  html: Interesting point of view. As always, there is no &quot;right&quot; answer;
    it depends on whether you have several large customers (in which case adding customer
    RT to CS VRF makes sense) or many small ones (in which case per-CS asymmetric
    RT works better). <br /><br />It also depends on whether you provision common
    services at the same time you create customer VRFs or at a later time ... and
    also whether you use an automatic provisioning system or configure VRFs by hand.<br
    /><br />As for RFC 1918 and overlapping addresses - I clearly stated that in the
    very first paragraph. In most cases inter-VRF NAT is a safer option (how many
    MPLS VPN customers do you have that use public IP addresses in their network?)

  html: In the past when we deploy managed endpoints, such as handsets for managed
    telephone service, or managed CPE routers, the phones and routers were assigned
    globally routable address space. This was due to the common services vrf design
    and its failures.<br /><br />For new customers that design is superceded for the
    phones by use of session border controllers with back-to-back user agent configuration.
    Now that SBCs are starting to support fully virtualized routing tables just like
    the PE&#39;s the duplicate address space is a non-issue, and the SBCs drastically
    improve compliance with CALEA.<br /><br />The same is true for managed services
    monitoring, instead of using common services vrfs and the trouble they bring,
    we just use vmware to spin up a probe with one leg on the customer network and
    one leg on the management network to handle all the administrative tasks.<br /><br
    />All in all, the common services VRF concept should be retired. It created far
    more problems than it solved, and better solutions (more secure, more scalable,
    more managable) are available now.

  html: I agree and disagree at the same time.  The common services VRF as is commonly
    depicted is severely flawed, but you can&#39;t get around the fact that highly
    leveraged servers/load-balancers/etc exist in an IP cloud separate from your customers.  You
    can&#39;t put public addressing on thousands of IP endpoints in your services
    environment.  <br /><br />I think with some modifications the shared services
    model can work wonderfully.  If you are in the business of pushing out IP apps/services
    to thousands of customers then at some point you need to accept some complexity
    as you are basically intersecting with thousands of networks.  <br /><br />1.  NVI
    is a no-go if you need customized NAT (can&#39;t reuse global address from one
    VRF to another). Virtualize your NAT router with &quot;match-in-vrf&quot; and
    you can customize NAT and inject routes as needed from one point.  With our design
    we can even control bandwidth into the services environment on a per-customer
    basis on the NAT router.  <br /><br />2.  Route-leaking is  a terrible idea.  Just
    give each shared services environment a pair of redundant PEs, assymetric route-targets
    (as described in Ivan&#39;s post) and be done with it.<br /><br />3.  Automation.  Quit
    being cheap bastards and build tools for EMAC work.  Hire a linux/perl geek and
    throw up a site built on catalyst.  Utilize the tools that vendors provide you
    (on-box Tcl, XML-PI, JUNOScript).
