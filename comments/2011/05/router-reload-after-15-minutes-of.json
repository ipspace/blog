      "html": "Just a thought. But in my experience it&#39;s usually enough to do a shut/no shut on the cellular interface to get the 3G back up and running.<br />I&#39;ve got this same request a while ago, to reload the router if 3G has been down for a few minutes.<br />(This was based on the customers experience with other 3G solutions, so it seems common that 3G users have to reload their equipment...)<br />But this ended with using EEM/TCL and doing shut/no shut on the cellular interface before reloading the router. (different timers). So if shut/no shut fixed the problem, SLA recovered and the router didn&#39;t have to reload. (And we preserve the logging buffers, and the recovery is quicker, etc.)<br /><br />There&#39;s also another issue regarding 3G.<br />Most 3G equipment can fallback to GPRS/EDGE if the if the 3G signal is to weak or unavailable, and this can happen automatically.<br />However, from what I&#39;ve heard*, the 3G equipment will not try to go back to 3G even if the 3G signal is available, if there is any data flowing. It will wait until there&#39;s no data transfer going on before going from GPRS/EDGE back to 3G.<br />(* I&#39;ve not verified this myself, but I heard this from someone who&#39;s more familiar with 3G equipment than I am.)",
