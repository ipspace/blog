  html: 'Ivan,<br /><br />There is a problem with complexity residing at the edge:
    complexity is inevitably expensive (in all aspects) and the edge is the largest
    part of any structure; which kills the economics of the solution.<br /><br />Otherwise,
    there&#39;s no real barrier here - nothing stops somebody from writing a vSwitch
    replacement with the necessary smarts.'

  html: One of your best posts yet. Every new Network Engineer should read it. I interview
    people all the time that think whatever the new protocol of the month is will
    solve all their problems. In the end, if they want to get big, they will need
    to get rid of those problems and worry about getting big.

  html: Dmitri,<br />The edge is where you have the most free CPU cycles, the most
    free memory, free buffer space, the greatest horizontal scale. The edge is where
    you have the post power to do cool things. The more you make the network do, the
    more it has to do. It can only do so much.

  html: 'Dmitri,<br /><br />Looking back, there were at least three large-scale technologies
    relying in simple-edge/complex-core architecture: X.25, SNA and voice circuit
    switching. Two of them are dead and the third one is not doing so well. <br /><br
    />As Peter pointed out, it&#39;s cheaper to do a bit of complexity in every edge
    device (because there are so many of them) than doing a lot of complexity in high-speed
    core devices. Case in point: TCP versus X.25.<br /><br />As for rewriting vSwitch,
    that&#39;s exactly what Amazon did for AWS to make it scale.'

  html: Peter,<br /><br />When we are talking about virtualisation environment, I
    would have thought that the whole idea was to have as little free CPU cycles,
    memory and buffer space, as possible.<br /><br />I understand where you coming
    from when you&#39;re saying that the edge is the place to do cool things, I&#39;m
    just not too sure about this particular case.

  html: Isn&#39;t is the same with the IP? If you look at say triple play environment,
    the complexity there is actually in the *service* edge, which is quite removed
    from the actual network edge (CE), which is quite dumb.<br /><br />I&#39;m not
    averse to the idea, in fact far from it (I pointed out my work on smart NTU for
    Carrier Ethernet services before). I&#39;m just dubious about the idea of turning
    the whole thing on its head, where there are essentially more devices with more
    state and more things to go wrong.

  html: In most cases you run out of memory/IO way before you overload the CPU. Also,
    vSwitch already does a number of cool things they have to do (in/out rate limiting,
    for example).
