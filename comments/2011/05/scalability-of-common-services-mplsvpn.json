Yet again, it&#39;s simpler to start per-customer VM with two NICs (one in customer network, one facing the central NMS) that does all the polling.",

As best as I can remember at my previous job we were using the same /24 network to reach Verizon&#39;s SBC as we are at my current job over the MPLS.",

Shared services and customized delivery of those services is critical to our bottom line.  There is one other concern with modifying the shared-services VRF:  risk and change-management.  Why touch the one shared thing that could potentially jack-up service for thousands?  Better to reduce the scope of potential impact by creating individual VRFs for customers and modifying those as necessary...",

Our newer and larger customers are demanding private connections. <br /><br />We were going down the road of Shared Services / aka Extranet VRF. Since we are application layer people we didn&#39;t really know the pros and cons. Our main network provider is not that helpful either since they only sell a standard service with no customization.<br /><br />Seems from above, going with a VRF or VLAN aware SBC maybe a better option for a VoIP only scenario.",
