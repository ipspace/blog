  html: Ivan is exactly right, and that is how I always start my own IPv6 seminars.
    As of last summer, 96% of the top 1000 Internet sites were  IPv4-only accessible,
    and the majority of the remaining 4% were google&#39;s whitelisted properties.<br
    /><br />But the reality is that no consumer, today, would pay for an IPv6-only
    connection without the ISP providing some mechanism to reach the IPv4 Internet.

  html: thanks for your answer, let me know if you can emulate NAT64 with GNS3 or
    something like that. Forgive me for my poor English.
