I am using eigrp as the routing protocol and I was wondering should I make each spoke eigrp stub?  Currently when I make a routing change on one spoke, it causes an outage to all spokes and I am not understanding why unless it is convergence that is causing this.  Thanks David",

      "html": "Hi Ivan, <br /><br />In a dual hub/dual dmvpn design, when using ebgp between the hub and each spoke, if we loose the main hub, it takes so long for the spoke to converge (detect main hub failure and reroute to the second hub) bgp dead interval. The hub has aprox 70 dmvpns, and 100 spokes per dmvpn. What could be the best solution to achieve fast convergence avoiding routing instabilitys and resource (memory cpu) overconsumption?<br /><br />Was thinking in using if-state at the spokes, or tunning bgp timers, or even both. Independent of the solution, what could be the correct values?<br /><br />Thanks, <br />Carlos.",
