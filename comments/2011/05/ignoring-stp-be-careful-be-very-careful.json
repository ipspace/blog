They could have implemented a similar feature set that Cisco did (for a good reason - sometimes you just have to get over the fact that Cisco actually does a few things right) or at the very minimum implemented the solution specified in the standard (also linked from my blog post). Unfortunately they decided to cut corners and I&#39;m just describing what the end results could be.<br /><br />As for &quot;picking on poor Hyper-V&quot; - I&#39;m not. I&#39;m positive there are other environments that allow you to configure bridging as easily as Windows does. It&#39;s just that I know Hyper-V can do that and it&#39;s a very nice graphic example of how quickly you can make a wrong choice that can melt down your network.<br /><br />Last but not least &quot;protecting people from their own stupidity&quot; is not a bad idea. Even seat belts and helmets have saved a few lives. What would you say if a car manufacturer would try to sell you a car without seat belts today (and claim that you can transparently mount them around the car)?",

      "html": "The issue is your phrasing. While yes it&#39;s always nice to protect the ignorant.  TRILL (even TRILLish) constructs absolutely MUST pass STP. It&#39;s one of the core principles of TRILL that Rbridges can be put between, around, or intermixed with standard bridges. This requires TRILL Rbridges to appear essentially transparent allowing all STP behavior to continue as if even multiple Rbridges appear simply as wire. <br /><br />What you call &quot;ignoring&quot; implies a willful choice to not provide STP protection, or possible, worse an ignorant networking malpractice. <br /><br />Where is if read the TRILL mailing list, or you talk to Mrs Perlman, Mr. Eastlake or others in the TRILL WG you see that this transparent behavior is desired and mandated to provide interoperability and backward compatibility. <br /><br />So while yes I agree it would be nice or even polite to provide bumpers for bowlers that may get into trouble. To say they ignored STP or cut corners shows a misunderstanding of one of TRILLs core values. And implies a malice or ignorance on the part of hard working engineers and thats just not very nice. <br /><br />As to seat-belts and helmets, they wonderful things that should be optional in my opinion.",

Just search for &quot;spanning tree&quot;. <br /><br />Or you might trust my summary of what the draft says http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/03/trillfabric-path-stp-integration.html. Although I don&#39;t follow too many mailing lists and don&#39;t spend time visiting industry events, I usually read the documents I write about.<br /><br />In any case, the way I read the TRILL draft, RBridges have to implement the concept of &quot;appointed forwarder&quot; which, to my understanding, Brocade decided not to do (otherwise they would have no STP issues). They should also terminate the STP domain (reporting their finding in LSP updates to check for unexpected domain merges) and not transparently forward the BPDU across TRILL domain (which Brocade chose to do).<br /><br />If after a careful analysis of the above-mentioned draft you still disagree with me, I will be more than willing to discuss the finer details of where I misunderstood the draft.",

      "html": "I am very sorry you feel this is a heated argument. <br /><br />I suppose if you felt it was a heated argument it would explain your choice to attempt an insult by implying that I haven&#39;t read -16. I have, as I&#39;ve read -15, -14 and so on as well as all the other bloody docs produced in the WG.  Why would anyone spend time reading the TRILL WG mail list and attending IETF meetings on TRILL and then not spend the time to read the publicly available documents? Reading the documents is the peaceful relaxing part ;-)<br /><br />I read http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/03/trillfabric-path-stp-integration.html (though there is something wrong with the link in your response) and I see nothing wrong with your understanding or explanation of the topic. <br /><br />Ah! Now I understand what you mean! Before you were talking about BDPU and root guard. And I felt expecting those to be implemented was kinda odd due to the relationship between cisco and brocade. <br /><br />You are correct on the value of AFs. If your goal is to allow for interoperability with intermixed existing STP bridges, an AF is in TRILL how you make sure that only one forwarder is spreading the good word of STP.  You did not mention AF&#39;s in your writeup so I did not realize this is what you meant, so I apologize for my misunderstanding.<br /><br />Do you know if FabricPath implemented AFs as TRILL suggests? Or do they just get around the problem of misconfigured nics by using BDPU/Root guard?<br /><br />So then VCS does not allow the intermixing of STP bridges between Rbridges. They also use FSPF (an ISIS&#39;ish link-state used in FC) instead of ISISL2. Cisco uses a q-n-q form in their egress frames instead of the standard TRILL header. Neither claim to be pure TRILL, and neither are. One needs a control plane change, the other a new chip. (I silently pray to the digital gods each night this will change sooner rather than later)<br /><br />However I really don&#39;t seem to be communicating well. So I&#39;m very sorry I&#39;m not being clear. <br /><br />I think you have reasonable concerns. It&#39;s your tone and language that bothered me.<br /><br />This for example &quot;which, to my understanding, Brocade decided not to do&quot; is a totally reasonable and even statement<br /><br />&quot;Unfortunately they decided to cut corners&quot; and &quot;seem convoluted and overloaded with features&quot; are statements that betray an emotion on your part that you do not approve, or that you think the implementers were stupid or had intentional malice. <br /><br />For you to say &quot;hey, in companies X&#39;s solution, they didn&#39;t implement all of TRILL and as a result if you do Y, Z may happen. So I advise you do not do Y until company X provides a way to prevent Z&quot; is totally reasonable and very helpful. <br /><br />For you on the other hand to make assumptions about why something was done and to imply they were ignorant or cut corners seems to be to intentionally insult. This may result in heated conversations =)",
