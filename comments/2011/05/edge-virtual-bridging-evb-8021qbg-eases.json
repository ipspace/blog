      "html": "Great article, Ivan.  I&#39;d encourage you to add &quot;Solution #4 (shipping/future): VN-Tag/802.1Qbh&quot;.<br /><br />VN-Tag-to-the-VM is available today in Cisco UCS via the use of VM-FEX technology - made up of Palo (P81E VIC) plus VN-Link (management plane integration between UCS Manager and vCenter). (Note: not all use of VN-Link involves Nexus 1000v. VM-FEX != Nexus 1000v)<br /><br />Summary is that VM-FEX is a shipping product that directly addresses the &quot;Challenge&quot; at the beginning of the article. Since 802.1Qbh is based on Cisco&#39;s FEX technology and is moving along towards ratification very nicely, I think adding this 4th solution to your article would be useful to the reader.<br /><br />Again, thanks for the article.  Great info.",

I think all of these techniques potentially could collapse under the weight of their own complexity.  Also, from a somewhat narrow networking perspective it all makes great sense, but from a broader perspective (i.e. server, storage, apps) it leaves a lot to be desired. IMHO, as virtualization densities grow, the hairpin traffic problem is going to undermine all of these efforts. <br /><br />My take here: http://blog.vcider.com/2011/01/vepa/",
