Two of them are dead and the third one is not doing so well. <br /><br />As Peter pointed out, it&#39;s cheaper to do a bit of complexity in every edge device (because there are so many of them) than doing a lot of complexity in high-speed core devices. Case in point: TCP versus X.25.<br /><br />As for rewriting vSwitch, that&#39;s exactly what Amazon did for AWS to make it scale.",

If you look at say triple play environment, the complexity there is actually in the *service* edge, which is quite removed from the actual network edge (CE), which is quite dumb.<br /><br />I&#39;m not averse to the idea, in fact far from it (I pointed out my work on smart NTU for Carrier Ethernet services before). I&#39;m just dubious about the idea of turning the whole thing on its head, where there are essentially more devices with more state and more things to go wrong.",
