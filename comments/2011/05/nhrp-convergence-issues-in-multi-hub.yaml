    html: It&#39;s hard to guess what&#39;s causing the outage in your case, but if
      you have a single router on the spoke site(s), definitely make it an EIGRP stub
      router.<br /><br />The case of two routers on stub sites is a bit more complex
      (example:you need a leak route-map if you have loopbacks on the routers), a
      sample configuration is included with my DMVPN webinar.

    html: Thanks Ivan.  I am using leak maps for my sites, but i am know going to
      make all of those stubs to see if that helps.  I was wondering if you are going
      to publish any cisco press on DMVPN, I have your MPLS and VPN Architectures
      I and II.

    html: I don&#39;t plan on writing any new books in the foreseeable future. DMVPN
      Trilogy (http://www.ipspace.net/DMVPN_trilogy) would be an equivalent to an
      in-depth DMVPN book (obviously in a different format ;).

  html: I am running two cloud topology with a headend 7204 for each cloud.  WE have
    100 sites with each site having two tunnels, one to each cloud.  I am using eigrp
    as the routing protocol and I was wondering should I make each spoke eigrp stub?  Currently
    when I make a routing change on one spoke, it causes an outage to all spokes and
    I am not understanding why unless it is convergence that is causing this.  Thanks
    David

    html: You could tune BGP timers, use BFD, or IF-State with some really creative
      routing tricks (IF-state brings down only the remote interface, not the hub
      BGP session).<br /><br />As for time values, the only correct answer is &quot;it
      depends&quot; - based on the platform you have and your convergence requirements.

  html: Hi Ivan, <br /><br />In a dual hub/dual dmvpn design, when using ebgp between
    the hub and each spoke, if we loose the main hub, it takes so long for the spoke
    to converge (detect main hub failure and reroute to the second hub) bgp dead interval.
    The hub has aprox 70 dmvpns, and 100 spokes per dmvpn. What could be the best
    solution to achieve fast convergence avoiding routing instabilitys and resource
    (memory cpu) overconsumption?<br /><br />Was thinking in using if-state at the
    spokes, or tunning bgp timers, or even both. Independent of the solution, what
    could be the correct values?<br /><br />Thanks, <br />Carlos.

  html: 'I suppose the 10 seconds you mention above (&quot;10 seconds to detect the
