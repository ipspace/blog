  html: '&quot;but even MPLS would hit scalability limits when the number of servers
    grows into tens of thousands&quot; , I don&#39;t see this is an issue, even with
    current day RIB/FIB limitations, especially as most implementations are doing
    single-label-per-vrf on the PE, can you explain?'

  html: The way MPLS/VPN is implemented today, you have to run MP-IBGP between loopback
    interfaces (to ensure end-to-end LSP is set up correctly) _and_ all those loopback
    interfaces have to appear as host routes in IGP and RIB/FIB. You would end up
    with tens of thousands of host routes in a single IGP. Not the best design.<br
    /><br />As for label-per-VRF, all implementations I&#39;ve seen use label-per-CE-prefix
    (apart from 6500/7600 where they obviously underdimensioned the LFIB), but it
    doesn&#39;t matter as the labels are locally significant to the PE-router. On
    the other hand, you do need a single LDP label to get to the PE-router, so label
    space is not the issue.

  html: Well, there sure are multiple solutions to allow for route summarization with
    MPLS LSPs, so scaling IGP is not a problem even in MPLS networks. The main challenge
    in the type of the topology used in the large data centers. More and more often,
    it tends to be fat tree for network that feature full-mesh traffic patterns. In
    topologies like that, the number of links (and paths) in the topology no longer
    grows as O(N), where N is the number of nodes. Per what we know today, In topologies
    with non-linear density growth commonly used routing protocols do not scale, and
    alternate routing solutions should be used, such as algorithmic or compact routing.
    As long as the network topology has link density proportional to the number of
    nodes (in other words it is more like a k-ary tree), theoretical scaling should
    not be a problem with any routing/switching technology.

  html: and if you are really bothered about using the IGP, why not use BGP to carry
    the FEC label? (i.e run labelled unicast address family along with vpnv4 from
    your hypervior+PE to your RR)

  html: Doesn&#39;t work if you have L3 switches in the path (and you need them to
    scale)

  html: This is purely a technical limitation, not affecting theoretical scalability
    of a given technology. As long as there is no theoretical obstacle to scale a
    design it is always possible to come up with a technical solution if needed. That
    could be connection oriented or connectionless technology, it does not really
    matter -  this is just an old argument of connections vs packets. The major factor
    that limits theoretical scalability is type of complexity growth in the network
    topology.

  html: I think that is quite a general statement (&quot;you need them to scale&quot;),
    L3 aggregation switching certainly has its place , if that place requires you
    to drop useful technology to save cost/space then perhaps it isn&#39;t such a
    great approach. I&#39;m personally not using L3 top-of-rack switching for this
    reason (instead we have L3 distribution which has full feature parity) so this
    approach would work for me.
