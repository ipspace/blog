Remember that stateless NAT64 has a very rigid structure of the IPv6 addresses. <br /><br />Assume that you have a single Class-C that you can use for mapping and that you want to have servers in separate subnets. I could probably design a solution, but it would be kludge royale.<br /><br />Interestingly, I had a discussion with Tore Anderson as he proposed the exact use case in one of his presentations and wanted to use NAT64 in ASR1K to do it. Turned out his design is still conceptual and after I pointed out &quot;a few&quot; limitations of addressing structure he went like &quot;Are you telling me this will never work&quot; and then &quot;Why can&#39;t they just allow me to configure static NAT translation?&quot;<br /><br />So, if you have a customer that actually uses stateless NAT64 (not static 4-to-6 NAT or 4-to-6 LB) to connect IPv4 clients to IPv6 servers, please let me know. I would be more than interested to hear (and blog) about them.",

However you can use SLAAC or DHCPv6 to allocate a fixed /64 IPv6 address to the CPE or the End users.<br /><br />The rest of the 64 address or the interface identifier can contain the converted IPv4 to IPv6 address.<br /><br />What do you think?",
