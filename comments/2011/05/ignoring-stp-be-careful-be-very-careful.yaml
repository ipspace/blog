  html: Hyper-V does &quot;true bridging&quot; if you configure bridging between two
    uplinks instead of teaming them. A nice recipe for disaster if you&#39;re not
    ready to catch&amp;stop that.

  html: Wouldn&#39;t the switch then give up the edge mode and act normally on the
    BPDUs (= block one port)?

    /><br />&quot;If you turn on PortFast for a port that is part of a physical loop,
    there can be a window of time when packets are continuously forwarded (and can
    even multiply) in such a way that the network cannot recover.&quot;<br /><br />Tested
    in a live network  O:-)

  html: "Want to make sure I understand this. So you are worried because the VCS switches\

    \ block it if you want? As I remember BPDU and root guard are Cisco inventions\
    \ to protect people from doing dumb things correct?<br /><br />The argument being\
    \ &quot;as it\u2019s way too easy to configure bridging between redundant NICs\
    \ in servers running any other operating system &quot;or in picking on poor HyperV\
    \ &quot;a single click in Hyper-V to melt down your network&quot; <br /><br />While\

    \ getting upset because a Cisco competitor didn&#39;t implement a Cisco solution\

  html: I am worried because Brocade decided to ignore the STP problem completely.
    They could have implemented a similar feature set that Cisco did (for a good reason
    - sometimes you just have to get over the fact that Cisco actually does a few
    things right) or at the very minimum implemented the solution specified in the
    standard (also linked from my blog post). Unfortunately they decided to cut corners
    and I&#39;m just describing what the end results could be.<br /><br />As for &quot;picking
    on poor Hyper-V&quot; - I&#39;m not. I&#39;m positive there are other environments
    that allow you to configure bridging as easily as Windows does. It&#39;s just
    that I know Hyper-V can do that and it&#39;s a very nice graphic example of how
    quickly you can make a wrong choice that can melt down your network.<br /><br
    />Last but not least &quot;protecting people from their own stupidity&quot; is
    not a bad idea. Even seat belts and helmets have saved a few lives. What would
    you say if a car manufacturer would try to sell you a car without seat belts today
    (and claim that you can transparently mount them around the car)?

  html: The issue is your phrasing. While yes it&#39;s always nice to protect the
    ignorant.  TRILL (even TRILLish) constructs absolutely MUST pass STP. It&#39;s
    one of the core principles of TRILL that Rbridges can be put between, around,
    or intermixed with standard bridges. This requires TRILL Rbridges to appear essentially
    transparent allowing all STP behavior to continue as if even multiple Rbridges
    appear simply as wire. <br /><br />What you call &quot;ignoring&quot; implies
    a willful choice to not provide STP protection, or possible, worse an ignorant
    networking malpractice. <br /><br />Where is if read the TRILL mailing list, or
    you talk to Mrs Perlman, Mr. Eastlake or others in the TRILL WG you see that this
    transparent behavior is desired and mandated to provide interoperability and backward
    compatibility. <br /><br />So while yes I agree it would be nice or even polite
    to provide bumpers for bowlers that may get into trouble. To say they ignored
    STP or cut corners shows a misunderstanding of one of TRILLs core values. And
    implies a malice or ignorance on the part of hard working engineers and thats
    just not very nice. <br /><br />As to seat-belts and helmets, they wonderful things
    that should be optional in my opinion.

  html: Jon, you might want to read the standards before starting heated arguments.
    In this particular case, it would be https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-trill-rbridge-protocol-16.
    Just search for &quot;spanning tree&quot;. <br /><br />Or you might trust my summary
    of what the draft says http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/03/trillfabric-path-stp-integration.html.
    Although I don&#39;t follow too many mailing lists and don&#39;t spend time visiting
    industry events, I usually read the documents I write about.<br /><br />In any
    case, the way I read the TRILL draft, RBridges have to implement the concept of
    &quot;appointed forwarder&quot; which, to my understanding, Brocade decided not
    to do (otherwise they would have no STP issues). They should also terminate the
    STP domain (reporting their finding in LSP updates to check for unexpected domain
    merges) and not transparently forward the BPDU across TRILL domain (which Brocade
    chose to do).<br /><br />If after a careful analysis of the above-mentioned draft
    you still disagree with me, I will be more than willing to discuss the finer details
    of where I misunderstood the draft.

  html: I am very sorry you feel this is a heated argument. <br /><br />I suppose
    if you felt it was a heated argument it would explain your choice to attempt an
    insult by implying that I haven&#39;t read -16. I have, as I&#39;ve read -15,
    -14 and so on as well as all the other bloody docs produced in the WG.  Why would
    anyone spend time reading the TRILL WG mail list and attending IETF meetings on
    TRILL and then not spend the time to read the publicly available documents? Reading
    the documents is the peaceful relaxing part ;-)<br /><br />I read http://blog.ioshints.info/2011/03/trillfabric-path-stp-integration.html
    (though there is something wrong with the link in your response) and I see nothing
    wrong with your understanding or explanation of the topic. <br /><br />Ah! Now
    I understand what you mean! Before you were talking about BDPU and root guard.
    And I felt expecting those to be implemented was kinda odd due to the relationship
    between cisco and brocade. <br /><br />You are correct on the value of AFs. If
    your goal is to allow for interoperability with intermixed existing STP bridges,
    an AF is in TRILL how you make sure that only one forwarder is spreading the good
    word of STP.  You did not mention AF&#39;s in your writeup so I did not realize
    this is what you meant, so I apologize for my misunderstanding.<br /><br />Do
    you know if FabricPath implemented AFs as TRILL suggests? Or do they just get
    around the problem of misconfigured nics by using BDPU/Root guard?<br /><br />So
    then VCS does not allow the intermixing of STP bridges between Rbridges. They
    also use FSPF (an ISIS&#39;ish link-state used in FC) instead of ISISL2. Cisco
    uses a q-n-q form in their egress frames instead of the standard TRILL header.
    Neither claim to be pure TRILL, and neither are. One needs a control plane change,
    the other a new chip. (I silently pray to the digital gods each night this will
    change sooner rather than later)<br /><br />However I really don&#39;t seem to
    be communicating well. So I&#39;m very sorry I&#39;m not being clear. <br /><br
    />I think you have reasonable concerns. It&#39;s your tone and language that bothered
    me.<br /><br />This for example &quot;which, to my understanding, Brocade decided
    not to do&quot; is a totally reasonable and even statement<br /><br />&quot;Unfortunately
    they decided to cut corners&quot; and &quot;seem convoluted and overloaded with
    features&quot; are statements that betray an emotion on your part that you do
    not approve, or that you think the implementers were stupid or had intentional
    malice. <br /><br />For you to say &quot;hey, in companies X&#39;s solution, they
    didn&#39;t implement all of TRILL and as a result if you do Y, Z may happen. So
    I advise you do not do Y until company X provides a way to prevent Z&quot; is
    totally reasonable and very helpful. <br /><br />For you on the other hand to
    make assumptions about why something was done and to imply they were ignorant
    or cut corners seems to be to intentionally insult. This may result in heated
    conversations =)

    technology like VCS or IRF , does N2K,N5K and N7K have the same problem ?
