            <div class="comment-content">Hello, Ivan, I enjoy your blog.  In my slides, I do suggest /120 as an alternative to /64 subnets, but my true intent is to make people realize that something other than /64 should be done, where appropriate, until vendors are able to deliver more router/switch knobs to protect against this attack vector.  This may be larger or smaller than a /120; but I think it gets the point across.<br /><br />It must be understood that ACLs may not protect your device.  There are major-vendor boxes that will still at least reach their NDP policer (if not actually learn ND entries) when receiving packets with new source addresses on a locally-attached subnet, even if the packet will ultimately be discarded due to an ingress ACL on that interface.  Operators should test their routers, because vendors absolutely do not provide reliable answers in this area -- including, again, the &quot;big vendors&quot; who we generally expect to Do The Right Thing.<br /><br />It is also worth mentioning that this absolutely will break IPv4 on many dual-stack routers.  Most people who think they may be ready for IPv6 today are not, and this is only one of many reasons why.  We need to do a better job of asking our vendors for needed improvements before we are all forced to play catch-up.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Jeff! Nice to hear from you and thanks for the feedback!<br /><br />&quot;ACL won&#39;t protect you&quot; - amazing how broken things can get. I always assumed input ACL is the very first thing checked by a L3 device. Am I right in assuming that hitting this particular bug would require the attack to be an inside job (pwned server) ... or the attacker targeting your WAN link?<br /><br />&quot;This will break IPv4 on many dual-stack routers&quot; - just to clarify for everyone else reading the comments: I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re saying NDP exhaustion attack also breaks IPv4 on those devices that use common v4/v6 L3 adjacency entries. Using /120 on a subnet should not impact IPv4 at all.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">It&#39;s a religious thing. /127 is OK for router interconnecting segments, but not all equipment supports it. /120 is useless, or use /127 or use /64. <br /><br />If you are running any dynamic routing protocol routes are pointing to link-local addresses of neighbor interfaces anyway - so assigning global IPv6 address to router interface is for troubleshooting purposes only - and here comes loopbacks - but problem is that with loopbacks only you don&#39;t see exact egress interface, but always loopback of the router. This might suck a bit in some corner cases. <br /><br />Use with caution (as everything else) if in doubt :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Dear Ivan, <br />In my opinion implementing IPv6 must not become a burden for network admin, so I try to implement IPv6 in easier way for me. Currently implementing dual-stack network, I try to match IPv6 address assignment with existing IPv4, so it will be easy for admin to know which is which. Before adding IP6 PTR record, all traceroute looks cryptic to me, so by doing that I can compare whether my network is working properly.<br /><br />I also try to take advantages of IPv6: /64 is huge, so no need for renumbering and change subnets such as IPv4. I only need to remember 3 kind of allocation: /32 or /48 for one organization, /64 for LAN subnets, and /128 for loopback. That&#39;s it.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The biggest hurdle to getting this kind of thing changed will be the service providers. Even on private MPLS L3 VPNs there are prefix size limits applied on the PE. The carrier wont carry or transport prefixes longer than /64. If you want to troubleshoot reachability of those p2p links you will be dissapointed.<br /><br />For the internet service its even more draconian, and they only permit /48&#39;s. There is a table on wikipedia thats kept fairly up to date regarding the ipv6 routing policies of many large carriers.<br /><br />There is alot of speculation about IPv6 but little hard documentation. There are no good reference designs for a global enterprise. There are routing symmetry issues revolving around security and other services that are today the network is providing. Other technology like network-based IDS/IPS, data loss prevention, and web content filtering fall apart quickly as well.<br /><br />We are activly deploying IPv6 in a global infrastructure and facing many serious issues. Neither Cisco, nor ATT nor our other vendors and carriers (even with their professional services groups) have good answers to offer at this time for all of the core issues that still exist with ipv6, and they all disagree on what the best practices are. AT&amp;T wants /64&#39;s while Sprint wants 127&#39;s. Its all just the tip of a very large ice berg.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">If we&#39;re talking about public Internet, I have nothing against enforcing /48 as the minimum prefix. Go to RIPE/ARIN/*, ask for a PI /32 and allocate a /48 to every site.<br /><br />Enforcing prefix lengths in an MPLS/VPN network is plain stupid (or maybe your SP bought those mysterious boxes that self-destruct on receiving a longer prefix). The SP should not enforce the content (including prefix lengths), but just the maximum number of prefixes accepted from a site or total # of prefixes in a VRF.<br /><br />Routing symmetry between private and public networks across firewalls ... nightmare! Right now we&#39;re working with a customer with similar issues and will probably make it work, but it will be way more complex than NAT would have been.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">FWIW, I labbed out a neighbor cache exhaustion attack on a remote /64 and wasn&#39;t able to get an 1811 (running IOS 12.4T) to hold more than a few dozen incomplete ND entries at a time. Not sure how this affects valid ND entries but it doesn&#39;t seem like a big deal.<br /><br />That said, there&#39;s no reason not to use /127s on point-to-point links. If a device doesn&#39;t support /127s, it&#39;s a vendor problem, not a design problem.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I think its important to remember that most providers arent going to re-buy every PE on their network to support IPv6 and that there is quite a long list of caveats in all vendor camps regarding hardware in the last 6-8 years that has some potentially painful hardware issues regarding prefix length. Classic issues include ACL construction and TCAM specificity.<br /><br />Given the world they operate in today, until the hardware is completely refreshed over a period of years, those restrictions are probablly going to remain in place. These are not small and stupid telco&#39;s either, including AT&amp;T.</div>

Real-life experience?&quot;<br /><br />Not actually answering your request :-) I did a quick lab on a 2901 with 15.1(3)T and a Win7 on the other end. The DHCP-server implementation at the Cisco end gives out addresses with /120 defined in the address prefix section and managed-config flag defined towards the Win7.

            <div class="comment-content">I Just did a similar test as Strech described. I used an Juniper MX480, generating ~380 pps for random hosts in a subnet on that router, resulting in lots of Neigbour discovery packets. <br /><br />I wasn&#39;t able to get more than ~250 incomplete entries in the neigbour cache. <br />At the same time learning new, valid ND, entries didn&#39;t seem to be an issue.<br /><br />So although it&#39;s a problem in theory, it seems that most implementations, i.e. Cisco (as described by Strech) and Juniper limit the effects of such an attack.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I like your thinking, I&#39;ve been following this every since a design where we mapped 10.x.y.0/24 subnets by mapping the 2nd and 3rd octets to the end of a /48. For infrastructure /30 links or /32 loopbacks, sticking in a bunch of zeros after the /64 and making the last byte match IPv4 works for /126 and /128&#39;s. (We designed the IPv4 addressing from scratch to summarize so mapping was not importing a very legacy IPv4 addressing scheme into IPv6.)<br /><br />Note RFC 3627 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3627 section 5, the part about u/l bits being zero. I&#39;m not sure how likely those bits are to get used, I&#39;m tracking IPv6 but not super-closely.</div>

IPv6 uses 128 bit addresses these have to be split for 64 bit architectures = added cpu cycles vs. IPv4 S/D addresses fit nicely into one 64bit word.<br />and more to come.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I am just curious about the real potential of such attack.<br /><br />When a resolution is performed with ND default values, a ND entry is created in<br />the state INCOMPLETE and a NS is sent. If no NA reply is received after<br />RetransTimer milliseconds (default: 1 second) it should then retransmit a NS<br />maximum MAX_MULTICAST_SOLICIT (default: 3) times. Then the entry is cleared from<br />the cache.<br /><br />So the entry will not stay in the table more than 3 seconds before it is cleared.<br /><br />For sure if an attacker keep on scanning, it will fill the table faster than the<br />table will be purged. But it will take some time to fill up the table<br />and the attack must be quite continuous without interruption or entries will be<br />deleted automatically.<br /><br />This means that it should not be difficult to detect and to isolate the attacker.<br /><br />If it comes from the outside it must pass firewalls which should be able to<br />manage this and take appropriate action at least to mitigate so it will not be<br />able to do much harm if it cannot block it.<br /><br />If it is local, an IDS capable of detecting port scan and other attacks should<br />also be able to isolate the attacker.<br /><br />So is it really such a big threat ?<br /><br />Fred</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The intruder can definitely cause short-term damage before you isolate him. Unless you have automatic detection/filtering mechanisms, it can take a while to figure out what&#39;s going on. Also, he can hit you from numerous source IPv6 addresses (admittedly limited to a single /64 if his ISP is doing a good job).<br /><br />Firewalls should be able to protect you if they allow access only to specific IPv6 addresses. If you use something along the lines of &quot;permit tcp any any eq 80&quot; you&#39;re toast.</div>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Ivan,</p>

<p>One small doubt.
Current, we have device with ipv6 prefix 64 and facing neighbor cache exhaustion while generate TCP/IPv6 syn attack from one of the device (using netwox simulation tool for send syn packets from  random sources).</p>

<p>If we assign ipv6 prefix 112s or 120s, somehow we could able to resolve this cache exhaustion and legitimate user able to access our device properly.</p>

<p>So, Is there any other way to resolve this neighbor cache exhaustion instead of reducing subnet size from 64s to 112s/120s &amp; add one router prior to our device for accept specific source subnets &amp; restrict remaining. ?</p>

<p>Thanks
Kumar</p>
