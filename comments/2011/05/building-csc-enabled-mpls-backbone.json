A lot of things can be L3VPN, including IPsec, GRE, DMVPN and all 6/4 tunneling mechanisms.<br /><br />The official name of the technology we&#39;re talking about is &quot;BGP/MPLS IP VPN&quot;. I guess I&#39;ll stick with MPLS/VPN, maybe explaining every time that I actually talk about RFC 4364  :-E",

RSVP-TE would work only with loosely source routed tunnels, as the VRF IGP doesn&#39;t have visibility into core IGP.<br /><br />The funniest part of CsC is that it&#39;s actually a single command (either to enable LDP or send labels with BGP), but the configuration guides describing that single command are 50+ pages long (yes, there are two of them, one configuration guide describing &quot;mpls ip&quot;, the other describing &quot;neighbor send-label&quot;  :-P )",

The key feature of MP-BGP based L3 VPNs was control-plane interworking, while overlay VPNs featured just basic data-plane overlaying.",

      "html": "What would need to be kept in mind when designing a new mpls backbone specificly for csc? When designing a new MPLS backbone, maximizing MTU is already priority one as many L2VPN customers consuming VPLS service for DCI mandate 9000 (and sometimes higher) byte MTUs.<br /><br />CSC also seems to carry a very different service definition in the mind of the largest telco&#39;s. While all definitions include running LDP (or at the very least swapping labels on customer interfaces in a VRF) the routing protocol and thus design of the service differ.<br /><br />Some (like Sprint) want to run LDP with an IGP such as IS-IS to do label exchange and LSR prefix reachability.<br />Others (like ATT) will only configure a static solution thus preventing dual provider multihoming for a CSC customer.<br />I have heard about one provider in EMEA that performs BGP peering with label exchange which most other providers consider too dangerous.<br />So while all of them acomplish the same thing (getting labeled packets to PEs that are customer controlled) by functioning in different ways carry very different configurations and operational headaches. Ever do inter-provider VPN label troubleshooting?<br /><br />The other consideration is that even without widespread CSC support, many customers are building their own MPLS services over provider networks. There is the payment processing giant FDC I mentioned before running 2547overDMVPN, a voice processing company running MPLS over L2 VPN (VPLS), and financial services such as citi just operating overlay VPNs on top of L3 VPN&#39;s. Overlay VPN technology like DMVPN or GETVPN work well when you dont want to expose internal routing to your service providers.<br /><br />Supposedly there was an MPLS over IP encap standard being written as well to address the headache of CSC, by making the L3 cloud in the middle completely agnostic and unaware of routing other than the connected endpoints.",

Also in regards to those books, read them from cover to cover. That way you wont miss a key concept that has you baffled. The answer was right on page 34 in a highlighted &quot;NOTE&quot; section.
