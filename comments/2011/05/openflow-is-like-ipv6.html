            <div class="comment-content">I like! Agree re OpenFlow and newness. Also the IPv6 purists comment. (And WHY is using ICMP as a larger part of the protocol a good idea, when MTU issues and ICMP-based DDOS have been a problem for IPv4 for years? Also who had the bright idea that anyone in their right mind would only have one upstream ISP, thus from one perspective creating the whole shim6 / LISP set of efforts?)<br /><br />Just ran across the fact that the Cisco IPv6 implementation does subnet bits not wildcard masks in ACL&#39;s for IPv6. This means if you use some of the subnet bits for NAC purposes, as some of us have been doing for IPv4 QoS and Security, well for IPv6, the associated dis-contiguous IPv6 wildcard masks are not an option. (Sigh!) I find myself wondering if there&#39;s a performance-related reason for that, or if someone was being a purist... I wouldn&#39;t think any IPv6 standard specifies wildcard bits.</div>
