  html: "I found your blog post very interesting. I think you may have missed a point\
    \ in the history of MPLS and the differences in the approach of Cisco and Juniper\
    \ as far as MPLS. I believe your history on the Cisco side is correct and that\
    \ they were looking for a way to do switching through the network without doing\
    \ an ip lookup at each hop and Cisco was pushing LDP as the standard for MPLS.\
    \ <br /><br />I believe that Juniper\u2019s first routers on the other hand were\
    \ built on ASICs so they did not have the same constraints as Cisco on IP lookups.\
    \ The thing that Juniper was trying to address with initial MPLS was a way to\
    \ replace the TE capabilities that were present with ATM. I think ISPs wanted\
    \ to do away with the ATM switches but still have Traffic Engineering capabilities.\
    \ My understanding is this is the reason that Juniper was pushing RSVP as the\
    \ standard of MPLS.  <br /><br />Since in RSVP you have an LSP going to a single\
    \ address the loopback of the remote device it makes sense to only have that single\
    \ IP address associated with that LSP. I think that Junipers LDP behaviour is\
    \ just applying their first implementation approach RSVP to what they implemented\
    \ later in LDP. This is just a guess on the reason for the implementation difference\
    \ but I know that Cisco pushed LDP and Juniper pushed RSVP at the standard when\
    \ MPLS first came around.<br /><br />Grumpy"

  html: Thank you! You&#39;re probably right, Juniper came out with edge routers years
    after the core ones, so their first MPLS application was most likely MPLS-TE (yet
    again, focusing on transporting traffic toward BGP destinations)<br /><br />BTW,
    Cisco also had RSVP-based MPLS-TE very early on, but it took them a while to get
    the headend CB-SPF sorted out.

  html: These ones were actually made in PowerPoint (I dropped Visio years ago when
    Microsoft bought and bloated it). The hand-drawn ones make sense for simple things
    that I&#39;ll probably never reuse.

  html: Ivan,<br /><br />It took me complete 24 hours to keep my head banging on the
    wall that why non BGP (infact I was not running BGP in my core at all) routes
    are not in mpls table of JUNOS and secondly why IGP learnt routes were not being
    labelled / tagged.<br /><br />Until I found this post :)<br /><br />No doubt,
    there is immeasurable gap between the knowledge base write ups of Juniper as compare
    to CISCO .<br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br />JM

      bgp-igp&#39; not address your requirement?

  html: 'Thanks for the reply Chris. <br />The reason: I want to limit the number
    of LSPs. (I want to load balance to a neighbour via 2 links, of which only one
    is directly connected to the neighbour. On Cisco I use forwarding adjacency, and
    require only one TE tunnel)<br />I did see &#39;mpls traffic-engineering bgp-igp&#39;,
    but did not try it because I was under the impression this is only needed where
    you want LSP&#39;s to be used for IGP destinations. In my case all destinations
    are BGP destinations (which automatically uses the LSP if the next-hop exists,
    and has preferred preference and metric in, the inet3.0 table). But I have since
    discovered that I might have to use that, in conjunction with <br />&#39;isis
    traffic-engineering family inet shortcuts&#39;<br />and<br />&#39;isis traffic-engineering
    multipath lsp-equal-cost&#39;<br />Will try and remember to post here if I ever
    get a chance to test it'

    html: You can control which prefix-to-label mappings are accepted with LDP filters,
      but (IIRC) once you accept a mapping from downstream neighbor, it goes into
      your FIB.

  html: "Hi all<br /><br />&quot;IP traffic received by a Cisco IOS router will be\
    \ labeled if at all possible (outbound label is entered in the FIB whenever there\u2019\
    s a corresponding mapping in LDP database)&quot;<br /><br />Since this is the\
    \ default behaviour<br /><br />with MPLS enabled, Cisco normally uses labels to\
    \ forward as soon as it receives labels from its LDP neighbors, if you want to\
    \ have IP forwarding you have to disable LDP on egress (next-hop) interface.<br\
    \ /><br />Is there a way you could have IP forwarding on an interface that is\
    \ LDP enabled without having to disable LDP?"

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Thanks for the reference<br /><br />I read about LDP filters,
    seems like the way to go. Since I haven&#39;t put that in practice, please help
    me understand this<br /><br />Say you have a series of PE routers namely (PE1,
    PE2...PE100). Now at PE1 you decided to allocate label for PE1 loopback (IP 1.1.1.1/32)
    with below command<br /><br />#ip prefix-list PE1-LOOPBACK permit 1.1.1.1/32<br
    />#mpls ldp label<br />  allocate global prefix-list PE1-LOOPBACK <br /><br />Does
    this mean PE1 will only allocate a label for the loopback IP 1.1.1.1 and ignore
    any other IGP learned routes?<br /><br />If yes does it mean if we need to have
    PE1 assign labels for loopback IPs of other PE routers from PE2,PE3,PE4....PE100
    we have to use the command below<br /><br />#mpls ldp neighbor 2.2.2.2 labels
    accept 99<br />#access-list 99 permit host 2.2.2.2<br />#access-list 99 permit
    host 3.3.3.3<br />#access-list 99 permit host 3.3.3.3<br /><br />Therefore the
    access-list 99 will contain the other PE routers (PE2,PE3...PE100) loopback IPs,
    but this does not scale very well assuming 100 PE routers, you will need a 100
    entries in the access-list. Is there a way you can reference all /32 prefixes
    in a non-contagious IP block?<br /><br />Or what is the work around in this scenario?<br
    />
