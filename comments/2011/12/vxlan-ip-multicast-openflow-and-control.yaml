  html: Ivan,<br />Curious to hear your opinion on OpenFlow controlling both the vSwitches
    and pSwitches. :)<br />Fantastic post!

  html: Ivan, nice write up. One thing I would like to add. In the case of IaaS and
    network as a service. The cloud compute API has knowledge of where a service attaches
    on the network, for example the service is a vm. Since the API has knowledge of
    where services connect (host name/mac/ip and vswitch port) this same information
    could be shared w/ the network API. The network control-plane uses this information
    to build forwarding (conversations) between services. This eliminates the need
    to flood, in the case of IP unicast traffic. Compare this to LISP where you have
    a mapping server/resolver where vswitches reference for the mapping of EID to
    Locator. In this case the EID is the IP/MAC of the service and the locator is
    the IP address associated to the vswitch (VTEP for vxlan). This is unique to IaaS,
    that the cloud knows where everything is connected and tracks mobility, the network
    simply plugs-in to this data for control-plane programming.

  html: That&#39;s absolutely true and that&#39;s how virtualized networking should
    work. However, that&#39;s not how VXLAN seems to be working today ... if you have
    other information you can share with me, please do.

  html: Why don&#39;t you just state &quot;I don&#39;t understand multicast&quot;
    at the top of your article. Would save us all some time.
