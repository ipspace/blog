  html: What exactly is a dual snowflake L2 design?  I understand the MLAG, but I&#39;m
    a bit thrown by the snowflake part.

  html: I assume &quot;dual snowflake&quot; is a design such as the attached image,
    which looks like a snowflake when rendered with the &quot;neato&quot; tool (part
    of graphviz package). Ivan can you confirm?

  html: Exactly. If you&#39;d add aggregation switches between ToR and core switches
    (for example, using FEX, NX5K, NX7K), and draw six &quot;child&quot; switches
    per &quot;parent&quot; switch you&#39;d get a perfect snowflake.

  html: I assumed by placement in the &quot;Small(er) data centers&quot; section that
    you were likely talking about a two-layer design. Depends on your definition of
    small, I suppose.

  html: '... and on the port density of the switches you use and the desired oversubscription
    factor.'
