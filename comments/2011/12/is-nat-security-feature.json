(at least, that&#39;s what I understood  :))<br />For Enterprise networks, without a doubt FW is needed, but for home network with few computers, where budget &amp; knowledge is limited, NAPT was quite useful FW.<br />I recently established dual stack @home and realized that suddenly I need FW too.",

      "html": "NAT is a &quot;security&quot; feature in another way: for SMEs that don&#39;t have PI address space, it prevents your existing ISPs from holding you hostage at renewal time. Renumbering even a 500-device network is expensive, and using private space and NAT makes that cost orders of magnitude smaller. So in IPv4 land, NAT &quot;secures&quot; choice of transit providers for those without PI address space.<br /><br />I managed a few painful renumberings during the late 1990s, and ISPs (especially incumbent telcos) used to use that renumbering cost as a lever during negotations (which made you want to stop doing business with them even more!).",

      "html": "As a security architect I find it interesting that the same type of discussion does not occur with split DNS. Both NAT and Split DNS are ways of breaking / avoiding the need for a single consistent address space or namespace across interconnected networks. This is often what needs to be done at the border between different security domains. I see NAT and Split DNS as design components that are used within Security Gateway environments to mean the requirements for interconnectivity; that does not make them security controls by themselves.",

Give us NAT or get to work on IPv7. Don&#39;t like it? well thats too bad... Reality is what it is. Like prostitution and Cannabis, somethings just will never go away no matter how much grumbling the powers that be do. NAT we want it. I don&#39;t want my friggin printer, phone, router, switch and 3 terminals to have public addresses. I dont want people to see if I have 3 or 3000 computers. I want to control each machine, each port and switch ISPs ten times a day with no firewall editing.",
