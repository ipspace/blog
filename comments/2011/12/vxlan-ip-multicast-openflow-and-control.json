      "html": "Ivan, nice write up. One thing I would like to add. In the case of IaaS and network as a service. The cloud compute API has knowledge of where a service attaches on the network, for example the service is a vm. Since the API has knowledge of where services connect (host name/mac/ip and vswitch port) this same information could be shared w/ the network API. The network control-plane uses this information to build forwarding (conversations) between services. This eliminates the need to flood, in the case of IP unicast traffic. Compare this to LISP where you have a mapping server/resolver where vswitches reference for the mapping of EID to Locator. In this case the EID is the IP/MAC of the service and the locator is the IP address associated to the vswitch (VTEP for vxlan). This is unique to IaaS, that the cloud knows where everything is connected and tracks mobility, the network simply plugs-in to this data for control-plane programming.",
