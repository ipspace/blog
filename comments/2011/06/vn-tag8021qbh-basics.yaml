  html: '&gt; 802.1Qbh (in its current form; who knows how the standard will look
    like in the end) allows any encapsulation (including 802.1Q, 802.1ad and 802.1ah)
    to be used on top of a logical point-to-point link.<br /><br />Aren&#39;t all
    the frame types you listed (802.1Q, 802.1ad and 802.1ah) are, broadly speaking,
    802.1Q (just with &quot;non-standard Ethertype&quot; in case of the last two)?
    I guess behaviour of VSI/ER may well depend on particular vendor&#39;s implementation,
    as 802.1 is um, let&#39;s say &quot;open for interpretation&quot; in a few places?'

  html: While you could stack anything over anything else, only some combinations
    are considered standard. EVB explicitly uses Q-in-Q (one tag for ER, one tag for
    S-component), 802.1Qbh allows transport of anything (or I&#39;m wrong yet again
    ;) )
