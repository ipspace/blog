  html: Great Functionality. Thats why we baked this feature into Network Director
    1.5 which works across all of Juniper EX switches. Beginning with Release 1.5,
    you can use Network Director to discover and monitor VMware vCenter servers, virtual
    switches, and virtual machines that are part of your virtual network. You can
    also consistently and seamlessly orchestrate the physical components of your network.
    You can also view the connectivity details between the physical network and the
    virtual network by using the View Virtual Network Connectivity feature.

  html: Question about &quot;It monitors VM-related events (VM start, VM stop or vMotion)...&quot;
    - To monitor does the tracer poll vCenter periodically or is the tracer informed
    by vCenter with an async message?
