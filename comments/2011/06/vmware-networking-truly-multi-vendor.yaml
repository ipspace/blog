    recent switches/firmware.

  html: Try the XNV link from:<br /><br />http://www.extremenetworks.com/solutions/datacenter.aspx<br
    /><br />There&#39;s also something about it in the concepts guide from:<br /><br
    />http://www.extremenetworks.com/services/software-userguide.aspx<br /><br />A
    bit light on details perhaps - I did sit through a slide deck on it but don&#39;t
    have a copy. In addition to the VM tracking functionality they&#39;re also talking
    up VEPA a lot, but I don&#39;t think that exists in any shipped product.

  html: Thank you. Exactly what I needed ;)<br /><br />Seems like Extreme has yet
    another approach - VMs are monitored by Ridgeline (NMS), the changes are then
    propagated to DC switches.
