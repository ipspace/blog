It\u2019s, basically, a technology that allows you to virtualize a VLAN. This allows different customers to be assigned dedicated vDS PortGroups that represent separate layer 2 domains\u2026 yet sharing the same VLAN ID. We use a technique called MAC-in-MAC to implement this. Kamau just posted a very interesting blog on how this works. You can read more here if you are interested. This technology is already available and fully integrated in vCloud Director so you can use it today if you want to.&quot;",
