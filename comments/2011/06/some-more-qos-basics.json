      "html": "I just recently implemented QoS on my MPLS WAN. It is a beautiful thing. <br /><br />I have four queues set up. <br /><br />Queue 1 - Priority voice queue (equals 20% of the link)<br />Queue 2 - Mission Critical Traffic (equals 25%)<br />Queue 3 - Transactional Traffic (equals 20%)<br />Queue 4 - Default Queue or Everything Else (10%)<br /><br />It really depends on your business needs as what goes in which queue. But my links can reach 90% utilization(large downloads) but the site doesn&#39;t notice any performance impact because as soon as they need something business critical policing will kick in. QoS will make a happy network engineer.",

I may be dating myself here, but you left out LFI and Link Efficiency tools from the list. cRTP was bad back in the day.<br /><br />Chris",
