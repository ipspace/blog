      "html": "Ivan, I have told you before that &quot;Heptagon is the new Round&quot;.<br /><br />It&#39;s simple science my friend. Heptagons are made up of a series of straight lines. As any one with even an elementary knowledge of geometry knows &quot;A straight line is the shortest path between two points&quot;. If a you take that basic fact then we can deduce that a curved line between those same two points would be much slower.<br /><br />Our heptagonal solution is simply much more &quot;cutting edge&quot; than the rounder wheel solutions implemented by &quot;legacy vendors&quot;. I can concede that a there are benefits to efficiency gained with rounder wheels, but I beleive that this can be achieved better by implementing more straight sides to our solutions.<br /><br />On that point, I would also like to announce that in 18 months we will release our &quot;Decagonal&quot; form factor. Our engineers are also currently working on a &quot;Tetracontagonal&quot; solution with an ultimate goal of making the same solution scalable to a &quot;Hectogonal&quot; solution in the next 3-5 years.<br /><br />The future is here now. &quot;Get on the Heptagon&quot;. You don&#39;t want to be left behind waiting for a standard implementation of this.<br /><br />Thankyou for your time,<br /><br />Kurt (@networkjanitor)",
