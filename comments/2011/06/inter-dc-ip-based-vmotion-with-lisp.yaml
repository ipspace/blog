  html: Has anyone networking vendor other than Cisco showed any interest in using
    LISP? Not saying I think it&#39;s a good or a bad idea. Personally I think it
    has some cool features. <br /><br />My question is more to do with they fact that
    while yes drafts have been submitted to the IETF, if you read the drafts, or even
    go to the meetings. It&#39;s just Cisco and Cisco customers. <br /><br />I&#39;m
    worried that with the emotional backlash against Cisco, that no other vendors
    will ever touch it. <br /><br />No matter how cool it is, how much help is it
    going to be if ends up being like EIGRP

  html: 'Let&#39;s put it this way: either the industry adopts LISP or we&#39;ll have
    some &quot;interesting&quot; problems a few years from now when IPv6 multihoming
    explodes BGP routing tables (not to mention provider edge router TCAMs). I don&#39;t
    see a viable alternative anywhere near the production-grade state at the moment.<br
    /><br />As for &quot;industry adoption&quot; - if Juniper decides to jump on board,
    we have all we need. LISP is primarily a technology solving SP problems, DC use
    case is more like &quot;gee, I have a hammer and this sure looks like a nail&quot;
    approach.'

  html: Oh, I totally agree, it&#39;s a nasty problem that needs to be solved.  Well..unless
    you make memory chips, then this is a good problem ;-)<br /><br />And I think
    the LISP team deserves a lot of credit for taking a very methodical approach to
    testing, sharing, and involving people in LISP. <br /><br />But you exactly hit
    my point. Juniper seems to me ( just based on working there for a year a few years
    ago) to be much more likely to come up with an alternative than adopt something
    so closely associated with Cisco. <br /><br />I think if LISP had be done by a
    different group, or maybe had been started out of universities like OpenFlow,
    it would be seeing HUGE support. <br /><br />I just fear that the &quot;anything
    but cisco&quot; mindset is going to keep even good things from geting the acceptance
    they probably deserve.

  html: Jon,<br />Your &quot;fear&quot; sounds a little more contrived than genuine.  Just
    say&#39;n.<br />As Ivan said, if Juniper feels LISP is missing the mark, they
    can certainly initiate a new standards effort as well.  But that hasn&#39;t happened
    yet.

  html: 'While I am happy to admit I am not a big cisco fan. (I was a cisco customer
    from 1996-2004, generates strong feelings) in this case I really am worried.<br
    /><br />In the edge router market cisco has about 37% market share. As for Core
    router market in 1Q FY11 numbers reported are<br /><br />Cisco #1 with 7% growth<br
    /><br />Juniper Networks # 2 with 13% growth<br /><br />Huawei at #3 with 34%
    growth<br /><br />So lets be more positive, since these are new sales and not
    existing installs and say cisco has 50% market share. <br /><br />Now, do you
    see what I mean? If only 50% of the routers on the net, 37% of new routers being
    deployed are cisco and can use LISP. And if Juniper, Huawei and others (others
    are less than 3% of the market) do not use or ever support LISP, then 50-73% of
    routers will not be running LISP. <br /><br />So then how much can LISP really
    help? LISP is a good idea, they did a good job of getting it out there, testing
    it, involving customers. <br /><br />I&#39;m not worried about LISP not working,
    or not being good. I&#39;m worried that a good idea may not get a chance to shine
    not because of the idea, but because of who delivered the idea.'

  html: I think there are two separate value propositions here with LISP.  One is
    for the end user and the other is for the Internet at large.  <br /><br />For
    an end user, as long as there is one other router running LISP to communicate
    with, they can see immediate value.  I know this because we operate LISP gateways
    specifically for this purpose.  <br /><br />Running LISP this way, however, is
    transparent to the Internet at large, and it doesn&#39;t benefit from LISP until
    the separate islands of LISP federate using a DNS-like solution called the DDT.<br
    /><br />I actually presented this at NANOG55 if you are interested in the details.  http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog55/abstracts.php?pt=MTk3MiZuYW5vZzU1&amp;nm=nanog55<br

  html: I think it would be cool if Cisco can add LISP support to the Nexus 1000v
    but unfortunately that has not happened until today. I think the next best thing
    is running LISP on the CSR 1000v which can be used as a default gateway for the
    VMs. <br /><br />For those interested I have written about a use case for LISP
    on CSR 1000v showing how to migrate a VM from a data center to the cloud without
    changing its IP address  http://anastarsha.com/deploying-secure-hybrid-cloud-extension-using-lisp-for-workload-mobility/
