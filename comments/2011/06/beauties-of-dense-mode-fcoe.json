Cat6K probably won&#39;t ever do FCoE, I think because it doesn&#39;t know how not to kill frames. <br />3: I can&#39;t buy a solution right now that does dense mode FCoE. Only the 5Ks from Cisco support it that I know of, maybe the MDS. 7Ks will at some point soon (4.2 isn&#39;t out yet is it?). <br />4: If I did iSCSI for block-level storage, every switch in my network would potentially be able to pull it off. <br /><br />I&#39;m fully willing to admit I just may be wrong about FCoE, but the first impression is not so hot.

In my personal opinion, you should use as much iSCSI or NFS as possible if it works well enough for you and move on to more exciting tasks than watching spinning rust.<br /><br />If you need FCoE because you need to integrate new servers with existing FC storage (common scenario, we are exactly in the same bind), it makes sense to go into FC world ASAP ... if you already have FC throughout the data center and if you have enough FC ports (buying new FC ports makes as much sense in my opinion as investing in SNA routers).<br /><br />And then there are those rare scenarios where the FC part of your DC is &quot;far&quot; away from the servers and you really need FC capabilities (don&#39;t ask me why, but some gear still works over FC only) and you&#39;d prefer to extend FCoE not FC ... and this is the niche where the multihop FCoE design debates make sense.<br /><br />As for Cat6K - I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath.

To answer your questions<br /><br />1.) the switch_id changes, the s_id and d_id do not. <br />2.) there isn&#39;t a TTL per se. However there is a hop count type construct. <br />3.) No traceroute in FC. However this is unique to FCP/FC and not necessarily FCP/DCB (FCoE)<br /><br />The reason I don&#39;t see it as routing is because without zoning every initiator talks to every target and you just have one big flat mesh network. Then you overlay zones which are similar to VPNs or VLANs in that they ensure that broadcast items such as RSCNs are only seen by the members of that zone. <br /><br />There IS FC routing, is that they only way to get devices in one Fabric to talk to another Fabric without merging the Fabrics is to route between them using EX ports and usually something like FCIP. <br /><br />With that said, FCSW uses FSPF which while operating at the equivalent of layer2 (as with IS-IS-L2) it is by definition a &quot;routing&quot; protocol, so one could easily argue that L2/3 be damed, routing is routing. <br /><br />I will point out however that in Cisco&#39;s own book &quot;Storage Networking Protocol Fundamentals&quot; by Jason Long http://books.google.com/books?id=zEFrqPrcZI8C&amp;lpg=PA368&amp;ots=3iCnK05DRO&amp;dq=does%20fc-sw%20have%20TTLs&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false<br /><br />He states &quot;FC is a switching technology, and FC addresses are Layer 2 constructs. Therefore, FC switches do not &quot;route&quot; frames according to the traditional definition of routing.&quot;<br /><br />So I should not have jump so quick to say FC is by no means routing. I just find when teaching FC that showing FCSW to be switching and then connecting two fabrics together so that frames can route to another as routing makes for clearer understanding, especially since most see anything at L2 as switching. <br /><br />However just as many have referred to ATM as being L2.5, TRILL as being layer 2.5 and since it uses FSPF one can certainly argue that FC has routing elements. <br /><br />It really just depends on if you define routing by behavior or by layer",

Same as IP, still routing<br />#2 - could you point me in the right direction to investigate the hop count thing?<br />#3 - There&#39;s a traceroute-like command defined in FC-SW, but it does not work like IP traceroute (you could say it&#39;s part of OAM functionality)<br /><br />Connectivity does not imply forwarding functionality. In an Internet with no firewalls/packet filters every host can talk to every other host, but it&#39;s still a routed network.<br /><br />The L2/L3 confusion probably arises from direct comparison of FC frame format with Ethernet/IP frame format. Just because Ethernet/IP combo has MAC+IP addresses does not mean that any protocol that has a single address in its packets automatically becomes layer-2. As I pointed out, PPP/IP combo has only IP addresses (well, there is a fixed-value byte in PPP header that&#39;s a leftover from SDLC days), but that does not mean IP is L2 protocol when running over PPP.<br /><br />Cisco Press books are good, but should not be used as an absolutely error-free authoritative reference. I prefer to rely on the standards that define a particular technology.<br /><br />Last but definitely not least, will study the inter-fabric routing  :-P",
