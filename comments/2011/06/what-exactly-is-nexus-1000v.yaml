  html: Hi Ivan,<br />I was hoping you would correct your article above, when referencing
    the VM-FEX. It  utilizes VN-Tag(802.1qbh) not VN-Link,  which is a marketing term
    that encompases vNICs, FI, N2K, FEX&#39;s and N1k.<br />VM-FEX and Adapter FEX(vNIC
    aka Palo card) all use the 802.1qbh.

    html: No. VEM communicates with NX-OS, which means that VEM has an independent
      control plane, not NX-OS resident in the adjacent Nexus switch.

  html: VM-FEX technology used with combining n5k wich do use NX-OS. In other words
    VM-FEX does have the NX-OS-based control plane, isn&#39;t it?
