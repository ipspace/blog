FCoE cannot be compared to TRILL at all and both address different needs.  <br />FCoE addresses unifies I/O: specific to the costs of Nx by NICs plus Nx by HBA&#39;s and associated cabling costs:implied savings, while TRILL addresses bi-sectional bandwidth requirements at L2. Both have their perspective use cases.  FCoE applicable if there is an existing investment in FC SAN, and TRILL applicable in use cases where massive, rather dynamic bandwidth requirements are demanded.<br /><br />If anything, the debate should be iSCSI vs FCoE, and ECMP vs TRILL.",

That was my idea before taking a look at their doc, and apparently this confirms this view.<br /><br />For Juniper&#39;s QF strategy this does not seem so problematic (I still don&#39;t see how they will separate SAN Fabrics at the central nodes, but let&#39;s obviate that), but I find it challenging to imagine how could Juniper deploy a multi-hop FCoE network not QFabric based...",

Nope.  You cannot cascade NPV mode.<br />Therefore the only option I can see would be to have both the blade switch and QFX3500 put in transparent L2 FIP Snooping mode, thus creating the limiting and undesired &quot;Sparse mode FCoE&quot; desing.  Ooops.<br />If the QFX3500 supported things like bridge port extenstion (VN-Tag, or Qbh), and FCoE FCF, then one could design a solid FCoE solution with blade servers, but unfortunately it does not and therefore lacks some much needed architecturaual flexibility with regards to access layer convergence.",

I think that this &quot;one big switch&quot; QFabric without FCF functionality might not be very usefull if you want to actually build a NETWORK where hosts actually want to talk to storage.

If the server (ENode) does not have it&#39;s own physical or virutal Ethernet interface on the FCF/NPV, (as would be the case with a FIP Snooping blade switch) how do you distinguish and differentiate one ENode from another?  You cant make it interface based so you need to move up the stack and provision configuration and policy based on the MAC address.<br /><br />Think about it this way, with a FIP Snooping blade switch how would you provision ENode-A in VSAN1 and ENode-B in VSAN2?  How would you do that without needing to know the MAC address of each ahead of time?  Good luck.<br /><br />On the other hand, with a port extender (FEX) as the blade switch, each ENode has its own virtual Ethernet interface on the upstream FCF/NPV, so you can for example provision VSAN based on interfaces, without ever needing to care one bit about MAC addresses.",

From a storage point of view it looks nice as long as you don&#39;t want to get ride from day one (two) of your native FC equipments ( most deployment scenarios will probably not ) as the NPV only storage won&#39;t work on it&#39;s own , so seems like a full blown FCoE only storage architecture  ( without 3rd party native SAN )  with QFabrc is today not possible but certainly will be in the future. <br />The article title mentioned TRILL so from a protocol point of view apparently the mpls-like DCF  is not supporting the TTL desired field and is relaying on the loop free Tree only. <br />At the end I think people will be especially focused on the 40GIG ( ethernet ??)  uplinks capabilities  :)  as all the emerging protocols are promised tol be simply a hidden c-plane from a user point of view.",

Without that visibility you have a break in the ability to use standard fabric-based tools to troubleshoot problematic and troublesome hosts/CNAs and are required to use the tools available from the CNA vendor.<br /><br />As you increase the number of ports (and the number of VMs behind those ports) this can become quite daunting. The N4k limits those number of ports to 16 server-facing, but IIRC some of the new switches from Juniper and others are 48-port FIP snooping switches. With VMs on the other end of those ports it can be an awful lot of manual hunting for problematic hosts.",
