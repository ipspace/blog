            <div class="comment-content">The keyword is &quot;eventually&quot;  :&#39;( Not many FCoE-enabled DC switches support Ethernet OAM. The CNA landscape is probably similar. Ethernet OAM is another SP technology (like MPLS) that couldn&#39;t possibly be useful in the Data Center. It&#39;s so much more fun to reinvent the wheel  :-P</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;m having a hard time with multi-hop FCoE (or rather, FCoE beyond the CNA to an FC LEP (switch that breaks out to native Ethernet and native FC). <br /><br />1: Dense mode FCoE dramatically increases switch configuration, we&#39;ll have to see but right now it looks like it&#39;ll be to the point where 1+1=3 in terms of total complexity. <br />2: I&#39;d have to replace most of the switches in my network to make it happen. Cat6K probably won&#39;t ever do FCoE, I think because it doesn&#39;t know how not to kill frames. <br />3: I can&#39;t buy a solution right now that does dense mode FCoE. Only the 5Ks from Cisco support it that I know of, maybe the MDS. 7Ks will at some point soon (4.2 isn&#39;t out yet is it?). <br />4: If I did iSCSI for block-level storage, every switch in my network would potentially be able to pull it off. <br /><br />I&#39;m fully willing to admit I just may be wrong about FCoE, but the first impression is not so hot. Did I miss something?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Supposedly FC has better management tools than iSCSI (I wouldn&#39;t know) and supposedly that&#39;s the reason why anyone would consider new FC or large-scale FCoE installation. In my personal opinion, you should use as much iSCSI or NFS as possible if it works well enough for you and move on to more exciting tasks than watching spinning rust.<br /><br />If you need FCoE because you need to integrate new servers with existing FC storage (common scenario, we are exactly in the same bind), it makes sense to go into FC world ASAP ... if you already have FC throughout the data center and if you have enough FC ports (buying new FC ports makes as much sense in my opinion as investing in SNA routers).<br /><br />And then there are those rare scenarios where the FC part of your DC is &quot;far&quot; away from the servers and you really need FC capabilities (don&#39;t ask me why, but some gear still works over FC only) and you&#39;d prefer to extend FCoE not FC ... and this is the niche where the multihop FCoE design debates make sense.<br /><br />As for Cat6K - I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath. FCoE is only in the NX-OS code and probably won&#39;t be ported to IOS any time soon.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">FC-SW (as apposed to FC-AL) is by no means routing. To think of each switch as a layer 3 forwarder is....well very confusing. <br /><br />Fibre Channel is switching. Which is why without zoning and lun masks every initiator can talk to every target. This is how a single Windows could write over everyoneâ€™s boot record in the old days. <br /><br />Now, there is also FC Routing. This is done if you want a target or initiator on different fabrics to talk to one another without merging the fabrics. <br /><br />A single flat switched network with 9,000+ ports is exactly what makes FC impressive =)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">It&#39;s not that FC has better tools than iSCSI. It&#39;s that FC has tools. Tools for iSCSI are almost nonexistent. And the tools that do exist are just not invested in. When people like Netapp give iSCSI licenses away for free, and iSCSI is often chosen because it&#39;s cheap, there just isn&#39;t much profit in it to fund cool tool development. <br /><br />With that said, you can decode iSCSI with with wireshark. Where as taking a trace for FC requires a very very expensive analyzer from someone like Finisar Network Tools (now owned by JDSU). So doing development should be much much cheaper</div>

            <div class="comment-content">One of these days I will read all the FC standard documents. To decide whether FC does routing or bridging (switching could mean anything just like fabric or cloud - read my switching-related rants), the following things would be relevant:  <br /> <br />* Are L2 headers rewritten on every hop?  <br />* Does it have TTL that is decremented on each hop?  <br />* Related to the previous one - does traceroute work  <br /> <br />I already know FCF has two router-like functions: it does communicate with the end hosts (bridges don&#39;t) and it runs a routing protocol (which makes TRILL almost-routing of MAC frames).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hey Ivan! Sorry for the delay, been on holiday  8-)<br /><br />I think we are just coming from different definitions of routing. To answer your questions<br /><br />1.) the switch_id changes, the s_id and d_id do not. <br />2.) there isn&#39;t a TTL per se. However there is a hop count type construct. <br />3.) No traceroute in FC. However this is unique to FCP/FC and not necessarily FCP/DCB (FCoE)<br /><br />The reason I don&#39;t see it as routing is because without zoning every initiator talks to every target and you just have one big flat mesh network. Then you overlay zones which are similar to VPNs or VLANs in that they ensure that broadcast items such as RSCNs are only seen by the members of that zone. <br /><br />There IS FC routing, is that they only way to get devices in one Fabric to talk to another Fabric without merging the Fabrics is to route between them using EX ports and usually something like FCIP. <br /><br />With that said, FCSW uses FSPF which while operating at the equivalent of layer2 (as with IS-IS-L2) it is by definition a &quot;routing&quot; protocol, so one could easily argue that L2/3 be damed, routing is routing. <br /><br />I will point out however that in Cisco&#39;s own book &quot;Storage Networking Protocol Fundamentals&quot; by Jason Long http://books.google.com/books?id=zEFrqPrcZI8C&amp;lpg=PA368&amp;ots=3iCnK05DRO&amp;dq=does%20fc-sw%20have%20TTLs&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false<br /><br />He states &quot;FC is a switching technology, and FC addresses are Layer 2 constructs. Therefore, FC switches do not &quot;route&quot; frames according to the traditional definition of routing.&quot;<br /><br />So I should not have jump so quick to say FC is by no means routing. I just find when teaching FC that showing FCSW to be switching and then connecting two fabrics together so that frames can route to another as routing makes for clearer understanding, especially since most see anything at L2 as switching. <br /><br />However just as many have referred to ATM as being L2.5, TRILL as being layer 2.5 and since it uses FSPF one can certainly argue that FC has routing elements. <br /><br />It really just depends on if you define routing by behavior or by layer</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Jon,<br /><br />Thanks for the comment (writing the reply from an easy chair in an Internet cafe  8-) )<br /><br />#1 - I assume you&#39;re saying the source and destination addresses don&#39;t change when the FC frame traverses the network. Same as IP, still routing<br />#2 - could you point me in the right direction to investigate the hop count thing?<br />#3 - There&#39;s a traceroute-like command defined in FC-SW, but it does not work like IP traceroute (you could say it&#39;s part of OAM functionality)<br /><br />Connectivity does not imply forwarding functionality. In an Internet with no firewalls/packet filters every host can talk to every other host, but it&#39;s still a routed network.<br /><br />The L2/L3 confusion probably arises from direct comparison of FC frame format with Ethernet/IP frame format. Just because Ethernet/IP combo has MAC+IP addresses does not mean that any protocol that has a single address in its packets automatically becomes layer-2. As I pointed out, PPP/IP combo has only IP addresses (well, there is a fixed-value byte in PPP header that&#39;s a leftover from SDLC days), but that does not mean IP is L2 protocol when running over PPP.<br /><br />Cisco Press books are good, but should not be used as an absolutely error-free authoritative reference. I prefer to rely on the standards that define a particular technology.<br /><br />Last but definitely not least, will study the inter-fabric routing  :-P</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Our organisation is at a cross roads, as I&#39;m sure is the case with many others, too. We have to decide whether to walk down the HP Virtual Connect path, or down the Cisco Nexus path (without UCS at this point).<br /><br />A factor working against HP Virtual Connect and for Cisco Nexus is the Sparse/Dense mode capability of each product.The SAN guys, naturally, want Dense Mode support, and I agree with them.<br /><br />HP continues to insist that Virtual Connect is not a switch and continues to target the server guys in their marketecture push (I currently work in the Server team that manages all our HP infrastructure, but I have a Cisco background).<br /><br />Every time this has come up in conversation I&#39;ve told them it isn&#39;t the server guys you need to sell this to (we&#39;ve already bought the benefits to server infrastructure the Virtual I/O features of VC brings). HP needs to sell their product to the Networking guys.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not supporting Dense Mode FCoE is just one of many oversights that plagues the product. Virtual Connect is currently too little, too late. To make matters worse, HP aren&#39;t showing a solid roadmap for the product.<br /><br />They aren&#39;t listening, and they aren&#39;t showing any leadership.<br /><br />They need to make Virtual Connect a monster. They need to truly make it a compelling network product and sell it to the network guys.</div>
