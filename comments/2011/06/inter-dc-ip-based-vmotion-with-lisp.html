            <div class="comment-content">Has anyone networking vendor other than Cisco showed any interest in using LISP? Not saying I think it&#39;s a good or a bad idea. Personally I think it has some cool features. <br /><br />My question is more to do with they fact that while yes drafts have been submitted to the IETF, if you read the drafts, or even go to the meetings. It&#39;s just Cisco and Cisco customers. <br /><br />I&#39;m worried that with the emotional backlash against Cisco, that no other vendors will ever touch it. <br /><br />No matter how cool it is, how much help is it going to be if ends up being like EIGRP</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Let&#39;s put it this way: either the industry adopts LISP or we&#39;ll have some &quot;interesting&quot; problems a few years from now when IPv6 multihoming explodes BGP routing tables (not to mention provider edge router TCAMs). I don&#39;t see a viable alternative anywhere near the production-grade state at the moment.<br /><br />As for &quot;industry adoption&quot; - if Juniper decides to jump on board, we have all we need. LISP is primarily a technology solving SP problems, DC use case is more like &quot;gee, I have a hammer and this sure looks like a nail&quot; approach.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Oh, I totally agree, it&#39;s a nasty problem that needs to be solved.  Well..unless you make memory chips, then this is a good problem ;-)<br /><br />And I think the LISP team deserves a lot of credit for taking a very methodical approach to testing, sharing, and involving people in LISP. <br /><br />But you exactly hit my point. Juniper seems to me ( just based on working there for a year a few years ago) to be much more likely to come up with an alternative than adopt something so closely associated with Cisco. <br /><br />I think if LISP had be done by a different group, or maybe had been started out of universities like OpenFlow, it would be seeing HUGE support. <br /><br />I just fear that the &quot;anything but cisco&quot; mindset is going to keep even good things from geting the acceptance they probably deserve.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Jon,<br />Your &quot;fear&quot; sounds a little more contrived than genuine.  Just say&#39;n.<br />As Ivan said, if Juniper feels LISP is missing the mark, they can certainly initiate a new standards effort as well.  But that hasn&#39;t happened yet.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">While I am happy to admit I am not a big cisco fan. (I was a cisco customer from 1996-2004, generates strong feelings) in this case I really am worried.<br /><br />In the edge router market cisco has about 37% market share. As for Core router market in 1Q FY11 numbers reported are<br /><br />Cisco #1 with 7% growth<br /><br />Juniper Networks # 2 with 13% growth<br /><br />Huawei at #3 with 34% growth<br /><br />So lets be more positive, since these are new sales and not existing installs and say cisco has 50% market share. <br /><br />Now, do you see what I mean? If only 50% of the routers on the net, 37% of new routers being deployed are cisco and can use LISP. And if Juniper, Huawei and others (others are less than 3% of the market) do not use or ever support LISP, then 50-73% of routers will not be running LISP. <br /><br />So then how much can LISP really help? LISP is a good idea, they did a good job of getting it out there, testing it, involving customers. <br /><br />I&#39;m not worried about LISP not working, or not being good. I&#39;m worried that a good idea may not get a chance to shine not because of the idea, but because of who delivered the idea.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I think there are two separate value propositions here with LISP.  One is for the end user and the other is for the Internet at large.  <br /><br />For an end user, as long as there is one other router running LISP to communicate with, they can see immediate value.  I know this because we operate LISP gateways specifically for this purpose.  <br /><br />Running LISP this way, however, is transparent to the Internet at large, and it doesn&#39;t benefit from LISP until the separate islands of LISP federate using a DNS-like solution called the DDT.<br /><br />I actually presented this at NANOG55 if you are interested in the details.  http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog55/abstracts.php?pt=MTk3MiZuYW5vZzU1&amp;nm=nanog55<br /><br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">I think it would be cool if Cisco can add LISP support to the Nexus 1000v but unfortunately that has not happened until today. I think the next best thing is running LISP on the CSR 1000v which can be used as a default gateway for the VMs. <br /><br />For those interested I have written about a use case for LISP on CSR 1000v showing how to migrate a VM from a data center to the cloud without changing its IP address  http://anastarsha.com/deploying-secure-hybrid-cloud-extension-using-lisp-for-workload-mobility/</div>
