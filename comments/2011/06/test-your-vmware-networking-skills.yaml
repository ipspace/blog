    \ /><br />&quot;...The first one is called vCloud Director Network Isolation (vCDNI)\
    \ in vCloud parlance or vShield PortGroup Isolation (PGI) in vShield parlance.\
    \ It\u2019s, basically, a technology that allows you to virtualize a VLAN. This\
    \ allows different customers to be assigned dedicated vDS PortGroups that represent\
    \ separate layer 2 domains\u2026 yet sharing the same VLAN ID. We use a technique\
    \ called MAC-in-MAC to implement this. Kamau just posted a very interesting blog\
    \ on how this works. You can read more here if you are interested. This technology\
    \ is already available and fully integrated in vCloud Director so you can use\
    \ it today if you want to.&quot;"

    html: Fat finger (= operator error). Many people think two port groups cannot
      have the same VLAN ID and thus believe VMs connected to different port groups
      can never communicate directly.

    html: We use it to provide load balancing across multiple physical adapters. You
      can override the NIC priority at the port group level. Within our Linux systems
      we create a bonded pair of NICs and it works well.

  html: Why would one have 2 portgroups with the same VLAN ID?<br />care to provide
    a scenario? :)
