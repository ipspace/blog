      "html": "100% agree. VM-aware networking enhancement is not just about resource consumption or speed.<br /><br />Designing a virtualization-aware network in practice requires lots of design work, study of failover scenarios and high/low level design effort. While EVB solutions do the job very effectively (Nexus 1000v being a great example of that), VM-Fex eliminates that extra layer of design, troubleshooting, configuration and management. This is huge in real life production environments when you have to deal with complex virtual-machine environments (with SAN and NAS storage networking, several management domains, different security requirements and traffic separation policies).<br /><br />Virtual networking directly at the hardware layer paints a very simplified picture, with predictable behaviour and easy troubleshooting. I like that picture, and depending on the scenario I may prefer it to an embedded EVB or soft-switch.",

Much less work for me.<br />* The physical SW is doing the QoS marking.<br />* vSwitch handles the load-balancing between ESX uplinks.<br />* No spanning-tree issues<br />* Life is good.<br /><br />I don&#39;t care about &quot;giving&quot; the server team the ability to map servers to VLANs, its stupid work. WHy should I do that.",
