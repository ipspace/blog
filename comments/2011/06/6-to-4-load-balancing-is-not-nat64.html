            <p class="comment-content">Ivan,<br /><br />Usually I really like your posts but this time I&#39;ll have to disagree with you.<br />I&#39;ve just finished a proof of concept of deploying LSN  that also included NAT64 using an F5 viprion platform which went very well.<br />The F5 implementation is a true NAT64 with the required DNS64 implementation as well (no need for external DNS64 device).<br />The implementation works just as you describe, with the /96 NAT64 prefix and mapping the entire IPv4 address space into the  remaining bits of the /96.<br />Of course the device also supports the kind of NAT you describe which is more suitable for a server side.<br />Just my two cents.<br /><br />Amos</p>

            <p class="comment-content">Just found out F5 has NAT64-like solution a few days ago. It gives you almost the same functionality (need to run a few tests) using wildcard servers and iRules. Will definitely blog about that.</p>
