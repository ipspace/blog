For all their talk of how much better switching is than routing its interesting that L3 features are not available for a few quarters<br />2.) They seem to do a rather poor job of competitive research as their details on Arista, Cisco and Brocade are off in a few places<br />3.) For all the Qfabric excitement the 3500 is listed as only Qfabric Ready* <br />4.) Latency seems a bit high compared to others<br />5.) 48 10G ports + 4 40Gs or +16 more 10G ports on one ASIC is VERY impressive<br />6.) Until the 40G support is ready, scaling to 6000 ports comes out to 96ish switches and if you really need to link every switch to every switch I don&#39;t see where you plug in the servers (in fairness to Juniper, they do ISP stuff, maybe they didn&#39;t realize servers were needed)<br />7.) I keep hearing mixed messages on their use of BGP and IS-IS. I am now starting to wonder if they use ISISL2 to keep with SPB and then a separate additional control plane in BGB.",

Incidentally, the L3 functions don&#39;t create a performance hit on the QFX 3500 vs L2.<br /><br />2) Please point out where this is, people are constantly shipping new products in this market.

As you point out building a fabric that does more than create an any to any connectivity out of just Ethernet switches is doesn&#39;t scale.<br /><br />7) Does anyone run BGP across the backplane of their switch?

I&#39;m by no means here as a &quot;Brocade Representative&quot; nor am here as an &quot;Ex Juniper Representative&quot; or as a &quot;CULT of the people who want to put their Brains into Robots&quot; for that matter. Just a geek who doesn&#39;t sleep much. <br /><br />&gt;a customer in need of L3 today, we might be able to help you out, although the hedge &gt;funds and traders buying the QFX3500 today are mostly using it as a L2 switch. &gt;Incidentally, the L3 functions don&#39;t create a performance hit on the QFX 3500 vs L2.  <br /><br />No no, I&#39;m very happy with no L3 at this level. I was just surprised as Juniper seems to in general favor routing over switching. I think for many applications a nice flat L2 network is much better. <br /><br />&gt;2) Please point out where this is, people are constantly shipping new products in this &gt;market. We&#39;ve seen a few compare 24 port to 48 port switches incorrectly as well.  <br /><br />If you follow the above link to the sales deck publicly available, I was referring to the bandwidth, latency, and power numbers you had for Arista, Brocade etc. Some were off. <br /> <br />&gt;3) Which was something we stated very clearly at the launch and to every customer, &gt;analyst, and press person for the last 6 months.  <br /><br />Oh! My bad then, my apologies. I was incorrectly told that the 3500 was the first Qfabric switch. <br /> <br />&gt;4) Compared to some of the 24 port switches, perhaps, but the standard deviation as the &gt;switch loads up is rock solid as has been validated as part of the STAC tests.  <br /> <br />I love the concept of rock solid statistics based on standard deviation :) However you are right, compared to other 48 port switches 900ns is quite respectable. Would be nice to have something in the sub 500 or 600ns range, easier to compete with IB. We should all get down to around 260ns soon I hope.  <br /><br />&gt;5) Thanks<br /><br />Juniper has awesome ASIC groups   <br /> <br />&gt;6) We don&#39;t expect anyone to build a 6,000 port network without the other components &gt;of the fabric.

No they do not.  <br /><br />Wow..umm...sorry? Did I say something wrong?  Well I must admit I don&#39;t know of anyone running a BGP derived control plane. Doesn&#39;t seem like a horrible idea to me. However maybe you are right, maybe no one ever will. <br /><br />Maybe you can clear it up? <br /><br />I thought Qfabric used SPB. However I have had multiple people claim QFabric will use some BGP variant. Which confused me.  <br /><br />So is Qfabric SPB? I mean I know there is secret sauce and all that, but you are saying _no_ BGP is used in Qfabric? So then it&#39;s SPB with IS-IS then? <br /><br />I apologize if I offended you Mr. Germanow.
