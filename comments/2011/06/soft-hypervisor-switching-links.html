            <div class="comment-content">Pass through switching (VM-FEX) is not just about a latency benefit.  The primary benefit is in the area of simplifying the linkage between the VM and the physical network.   With pass through (VM-FEX), lower latency, less server CPU, etc, is just the icing on the cake.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">100% agree. VM-aware networking enhancement is not just about resource consumption or speed.<br /><br />Designing a virtualization-aware network in practice requires lots of design work, study of failover scenarios and high/low level design effort. While EVB solutions do the job very effectively (Nexus 1000v being a great example of that), VM-Fex eliminates that extra layer of design, troubleshooting, configuration and management. This is huge in real life production environments when you have to deal with complex virtual-machine environments (with SAN and NAS storage networking, several management domains, different security requirements and traffic separation policies).<br /><br />Virtual networking directly at the hardware layer paints a very simplified picture, with predictable behaviour and easy troubleshooting. I like that picture, and depending on the scenario I may prefer it to an embedded EVB or soft-switch.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">For me, vSwitch is a bless.<br /><br />In the old, non virtual days, all I configured for a server was the VLAN is was on and do QoS marking.<br /><br />Now with vSwitch:<br />* The server team is doing the VLAN mapping. Much less work for me.<br />* The physical SW is doing the QoS marking.<br />* vSwitch handles the load-balancing between ESX uplinks.<br />* No spanning-tree issues<br />* Life is good.<br /><br />I don&#39;t care about &quot;giving&quot; the server team the ability to map servers to VLANs, its stupid work. WHy should I do that.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">This study conveniently ignores TCP segmentation offload, checksum calculation offload, CRC offload etc. that have to be done in software with soft switching.</div>
