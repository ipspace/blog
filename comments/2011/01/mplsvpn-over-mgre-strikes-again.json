      "html": "Interesting line of thought, but it just doesn&#39;t feel right, as the IP core has nothing to do with the MPLS forwarding. GRE is just an application as far as IP is concerned. <br /><br />Following the same argument you could call (traditional, not MPLS-enabled) ATM switches P-routers when there&#39;s an ATM VC linking two PE-routers. Or you could call IP routers &quot;voice switches&quot; just because they forward VoIP packets.<br /><br />On the other hand, RFC 4364 says &quot;Routers in the SP&#39;s network that do not attach to CE devices are known as &quot;P routers&quot;.&quot;, making your argument valid. <br /><br />However, RFC 4023 talks about &quot;adjacent LSRs separated by IP network&quot;, raising the question whether a box must be an LSR to be called a P-router.<br /><br />Now I&#39;m getting confused :-E",
