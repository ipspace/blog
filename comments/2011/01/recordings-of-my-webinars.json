      "html": "Hi. I bought 3 courses last year. I like very much this blog and Ivan work. I&#39;ll buy the annual subscription.<br />Also it&#39;s a lot easier to hear and understand English spoken by non-UK (as I&#39;m Italian), so I enjoy a so much the webinars. Thanks Ivan! Also thanks to all blog visitors that drop a lot of interesting comments.<br /><br />So.. the only thing I dislike is Google.. the only way to get a bit of privacy with their Android based phones is to stop everything going to their IP domain via iptables.",
