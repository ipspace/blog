  html: 'Yep, spot on Ivan, this absolutely matches my memory.  I first came across
    tag switching/MPLS in around the &#39;97-&#39;99 timeframe.  As I remember it,
    tag switching was originally meant to help with performance: instead of a router
    having to perform a classical IP lookup, it would instead just do a simple tag
    lookup in order to determine the egress interface (and tag).  As you say, in those
    early days, it was nothing at all to do with VPNs -- that came a bit later on,
    along with all the other derived technologies that complicate our lives today
    (and keep us busy in work!).<br /><br />As I remember it, at around the turn of
    the millennium, the performace gains that tag switching/MPLS were meant to provide
    were largely negated by the advent of wire-speed routers (e.g. Juniper M40/M160,
    Cisco GSR) along with higher-speed WAN interfaces (e.g. STM-64 PoS).  This was
    all during the dot-boom and before the crash, so it was happy days!   8-)'

  html: just to add some more garnish..<br /><br />I understand it was  envisioned
    that applications could be built using label stacks that hadn&#39;t been though
    of before. Also IPSILONs version for flow switching i.e. forwarding plane set
    up.. and furthermore they were bought by NOKIA and is the OS for Checkpoint and
    3G devices.<br /><br />here is the ref<br /><br /> http://www.amazon.com/MPLS-Technology-Applications-Kaufmann-Networking/dp/1558606564<br
    /><br />I got laughed at by the business and marketing people for mentioning at
    the time all future services would be build on MPLS because of its flexibilty..
    (LOL)<br /><br />I also heard that not all people in the  IETF love Yakov and
    MPLS due to the adding complexity principle.
