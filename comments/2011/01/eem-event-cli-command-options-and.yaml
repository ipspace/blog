  html: It&#39;s not new, but when I read something about &#39;event cli&#39;, I always
    imagine some boundary router with totally invisible script inside that is ruled
    by hidden ICMP payload matched with FPM...  O:-)<br />It&#39;s a perfect platform
    for any attack. Almost impossible to detect.<br />I don&#39;t have any malicious
    activities in my mind actually. Just the first thought.  :)

  html: I&#39;m still confused, what would be the difference between sync no skip
    yes and sync yes and seting _exit_status to 0 ?

  html: None. You need &quot;sync yes&quot; and _exit_status when you want to conditionally
    enable/disable the command or when you need to write a message to the use (with
    &quot;sync no&quot; all applet output goes to syslog).

  html: Ivan, <br />Is there any scenario when we use &quot;sync no skip no&quot;
    ?

  html: You want to log the commands without blocking them (almost like TACACS+ command
    accounting)<br /><br />http://blog.ioshints.info/2006/11/cli-command-logging-without-tacacs.html

  html: Hi,<br />I want to try to stop the changes for local-preference. I use the
    applet:<br />event manager applet test<br /> event cli pattern &quot;set local-preference&quot;
    sync yes<br /> action 1.0 set _exit_status &quot;0&quot;<br /><br />As far as
    I understood the command should not be executed but actually the set statement
    is present in the route-map.<br />Am I mistaken or this is not possible ?
