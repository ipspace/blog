  html: Well,<br /><br />I got two IBM servers, IBM DS3400 storage and VMware on top
    of it.<br /><br />Zero experience and still was able to install and configure
    all of it. I know that an experienced guy will find a few design mistakes!<br
    /><br />I love Vmotion :)<br /><br />I will get an UCS 200 in a few weeks, can&#39;t
    wait.

  html: Nice! Without DNS, you may be able to get things working by adding records
