      "html": "Close to mission impossible. All spokes have to be in the same area as they are connected to the same subnet (which is why OSPF over DMVPN does not scale) and thus they get all intra-area information.<br /><br />The only trick you could use would be flood filters on the hub http://wiki.nil.com/OSPF_flooding_filters_in_hub-and-spoke_environment but then you need static default routes on the spokes. OK if you have a non-redundant setup, &quot;slightly&quot; harder if you need redundancy.",
