  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />There are afew small things which do differentiate IRF.
    <br /><br />1) irf in a 2-chassis &quot;stack&quot; shares state across all 4management
    modules. Unlike the rpr-warm in the VSS solution. Cisco&#39;s approach is to reboot
    the chassis if the in-chassis master fails. HP just drops to half speed ( which
    is still usually faster than Cisco&#39;s full speed!) <br />2) IRF does require
    specific hardware within the same family, but that&#39;s about were it ends. No
    restriction in which series of line cards(67xx) only. No situations were the line
    cards will not be given power. And we actually have the ability to have PoE AND
    IRF in e same chassis.<br /><br />3) Consistency across the portfolio. Operationally,
    this means we have consistent bevahiour at each tier oath network. Compared to
    the various options available (stack wise, VSS, vpc, fabric path,etc...) that
    fill some of the functionality of IRF.<br /><br />4) IRF is hardened in the field.
    IRF is based on 3coms XRN from the late 90&#39;s. Withoutnletting the cat out
    of the bag; this means that we have already solved a lot of the problems that
    go along with this type of technology.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br /><br />Chris

  html: Hey ivan,<br /><br />You&#39;re right on that. Sorry if i wasn&#39;t clear,
    the failover to the master chassis takes about 400ms from my reading (compared
    to approx 50ms with IRF). My point was the in-chassis failover is abysmal. Reboot
    the whole chassis? In this scenario there&#39;s also no guidance as to the length
    of time that the VSS pair will take to reconvert because of the variance in time
    it may take for the cat6k to reboot depending on which modules are in the box.

  html: 'Doesn&#39;t VSS avoid the reload scenario by simply failing back to the active
    supervisor? I need to check figures for failover to the master chassis, but I
    think the failover time was fairly switft using MECs up and downstream.<br /><br
    />P.S: I am currently testing an enterprise level network. This would be a good
    test to try.'

  html: If you have two SUP modules in a single chassis (4 SUPs per VSS), the secondary
    SUP in the master chassis stays dormant. If the primary SUP in the master chassis
    fails, the whole chassis has to reboot (including going through the power-up tests)
    before the secondary SUP can take over (or at least that&#39;s my understanding
    of the documentation - could be way wrong).

  html: Chris - could you please describe your software upgrade process when pair
    of A12500 using IRF? From what I understand you have to have same code for both
    chassis in order to run IRF? so you can&#39;t upgrade your core without downtime?

  html: In general, an IRF stack can be upgraded while maintaining service if the
    proper upgrade procedure is followed. With the proper split brain (which they
    call Multiple Active Detection - MAD) in place, 1 unit can be reloaded with new
    code, a split brain can be forced and the MAD will reload the other node (after
    the first unit has come online). It basically relies on the remote link-aggregation
    link failover for the in-service upgrade. Based on tests I have done, you have
    about 2-3 seconds failover time (tested using fping between end stations) for
    the full firmware upgrade using this procedure. This procedure currently only
    applies to a 2-node stack however, so if you need this &#39;always on&#39; functionality
    it seems best to stick to 2 members in the stack at present.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />You are right that IRF is similar in function as VSS.
    For me the key difference would be that VSS is platform restricted (65xx), while
    the same distributed forwarding technology (each irf member can perform full local
    forwarding, no need to consult master) is available in the form of IRF on basically
    &#39;all&#39; switches in the H3C portfolio, from the low-end to the high-end.
    <br />This means for instance that the 5800 (top of rack switch) in a stack has
    distributed L2 forwarding, distributed L3 IPv4 forwarding, distributed L3 IPv6
    forwarding and distributed MPLS/VPLS forwarding, traffic never needs to pass/consult
    the master for the actual traffic forwarding.<br />I do not know if it will be
    useful, but I heard that IRF support for 4 chassis switches will be released in
    the near future.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br />I read IRF is Active-Active mode, and much more performed during
    failover compared with VSS. The latency is better than VSS or vPC

  html: Not sure if HP has fixed this, but last year I saw data on several lab demonstrations
    where it was proven that IRF does not support QoS between switches in the stack.  This
    is HORRIBLE for voice deployments because you have to architect your network to
    avoid sending voice/video traffic across IRF links.  To me this is unforgivable
    in a switching architecture .. you may as well not even bother and just tell everyone
    to use 10GbE links to stack your switches, because at least then you can use QoS.  But
    wait, QoS priority queue doesn&#39;t work on a lot of E-Series switches either
    :)

    html: Yes. However, keep in mind that IRF (and all other stacking solutions) work
      best if you connect the outside switch (or LACP-capable server) to every member
      of the stack.

  html: Does IRF allow for multihoming at the Edge?  E.g. a vanilla 802.3ad capable
    switch connecting to two distinct &#39;leafs&#39; part of an IRF?

  html: Hi<br />Im afraid that you didn&#39;t understad so well the guides you read
    it. First, obviously, any vendor can even make an stack with other vendors, and
    HP either. Second, there is not a master slave usage, If the &quot;master&quot;
    switch failed, the IRF array stills up, there is not a dependency. Third, Imagine
    IRF and Cisco VSS are the same thing, but HP IRF is available since $2,000 dollars
    switches, Cisco is requiring the Nexus models or Catalys 6500, how much do these
    switches cost?
