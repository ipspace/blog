            <div class="comment-content">Yep, spot on Ivan, this absolutely matches my memory.  I first came across tag switching/MPLS in around the &#39;97-&#39;99 timeframe.  As I remember it, tag switching was originally meant to help with performance: instead of a router having to perform a classical IP lookup, it would instead just do a simple tag lookup in order to determine the egress interface (and tag).  As you say, in those early days, it was nothing at all to do with VPNs -- that came a bit later on, along with all the other derived technologies that complicate our lives today (and keep us busy in work!).<br /><br />As I remember it, at around the turn of the millennium, the performace gains that tag switching/MPLS were meant to provide were largely negated by the advent of wire-speed routers (e.g. Juniper M40/M160, Cisco GSR) along with higher-speed WAN interfaces (e.g. STM-64 PoS).  This was all during the dot-boom and before the crash, so it was happy days!   8-)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">just to add some more garnish..<br /><br />I understand it was  envisioned that applications could be built using label stacks that hadn&#39;t been though of before. Also IPSILONs version for flow switching i.e. forwarding plane set up.. and furthermore they were bought by NOKIA and is the OS for Checkpoint and 3G devices.<br /><br />here is the ref<br /><br /> http://www.amazon.com/MPLS-Technology-Applications-Kaufmann-Networking/dp/1558606564<br /><br />I got laughed at by the business and marketing people for mentioning at the time all future services would be build on MPLS because of its flexibilty.. (LOL)<br /><br />I also heard that not all people in the  IETF love Yakov and MPLS due to the adding complexity principle.</div>
