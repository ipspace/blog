  html: Do MPLS/VPN-over-mGRE and mVPN share the same or a similar architecture on
    the core side?<br />Would the main difference be PE-router array determination?

  html: There is no &quot;core side&quot; - it&#39;s pure IP forwarding beyond the
    PE-router.<br /><br />As far as I understand, both features use the same encapsulation
    and differ primarily in actual implementation and IOS configuration mechanisms.
    Do they interoperate? I would guess &quot;yes&quot; but would not bet my network
    design on it.

  html: Considering that this architecture is refered to as MPLS/VPN I thought it&#39;d
    be proper to call the P routers array the &#39;core side&#39;, backbone or P-Network
    (I prefer the latter).<br />I thought of MPLS/VPN-over-mGRE and mVPN being similar
    as the GRE P-packets use IP <br />only, be it public ip addresses or a SP MPLS
    backbone (IGP only/no LDP).<br />I gotta reread your MPLS and VPN Architectures,

  html: Interesting line of thought, but it just doesn&#39;t feel right, as the IP
    core has nothing to do with the MPLS forwarding. GRE is just an application as
    far as IP is concerned. <br /><br />Following the same argument you could call
    (traditional, not MPLS-enabled) ATM switches P-routers when there&#39;s an ATM
    VC linking two PE-routers. Or you could call IP routers &quot;voice switches&quot;
    just because they forward VoIP packets.<br /><br />On the other hand, RFC 4364
    says &quot;Routers in the SP&#39;s network that do not attach to CE devices are
    known as &quot;P routers&quot;.&quot;, making your argument valid. <br /><br />However,
    RFC 4023 talks about &quot;adjacent LSRs separated by IP network&quot;, raising
    the question whether a box must be an LSR to be called a P-router.<br /><br />Now
    I&#39;m getting confused :-E
