  html: Ivan,<br />A strong argument for software solutions is that the processor
    speeds will always increase faster than new generations of adapter hardware can
    be spun. The difference between Intel&#39;s NICs and the CNAs from traditional
    FC vendors continues to shrink - the question is who will win 10Gb market share;
    FCoE is unlikely to be the tail wagging this dog.
