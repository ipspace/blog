If so, then yes, you need to configure the port-channel interface and use &quot;channel-group X mode on&quot; in the member interface configs. It also works best if you configure global command &quot;port-channel load-balance src-dst-ip&quot;.  There are a couple items/issues I know of that it helps to be aware of if you go this route, linked below.<br /><br />http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1001938<br />http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2010/08/06/standby-nics-in-an-ip-hash-configuration/<br /><br />If you&#39;re using vSphere 4.1 and a distributed vSwitch, you might also be in the Load Based Teaming option, http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1022590.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />-Loren",

It&#39;s a loop prevention thing: don&#39;t forward frames that might loop endlessly.<br /><br />The duration of the drop interval is in the tens of seconds each time the &quot;flap&quot; threshold (moves/interval) is exceeded.<br /><br />Frustratingly, exactly what constitutes a &quot;flap&quot;, whether traffic is dropped and for how long is platform and OS dependent.<br /><br />Static LAG (channel-group X mode on) comes with its own set of drawbacks, of course.  There are ways for things to go wrong that LACP would notice, but &quot;on&quot; will not.",

The big difference between Cat4k CatOS and Cat4k IOS<br />is, in CatOS, the cat4k drops traffic from the flapping host for<br />approximately 15 seconds.  In IOS, the cat4k does not drop traffic because<br />of host flapping.<br /> <br />Both Cat4k CatOS and IOS use the following algorithm to declare a host<br />flapping:<br /> <br />If the supervisor see 4 or more moves between ports from a single source mac<br />in a window of around 15 seconds, then it declares the host to be flapping.<br />------------------------------",

You can not use dynamic LACP or dynamic 802.3ad on the physical switch ports since LACP/802.3ad are not supported on the vSwitch.

Is this because the MAC address of the virtual vswitch can really only be assigned to one of the nics?<br /><br />The vSwitch is set to Load Balance, route based on ip hash.  The switch&#39;s LAG configuration is static.  If we set it to LACP, we lose connection to the internal VMs.  A third nic keeps us connected to the management interface.<br /><br />Luke",
