      "html": "It&#39;s not necessarily as bad as the diagram indicates...yes, this is what happens when the VMs are on different ESX hosts, but any VMs in the same port group on the same host will be switched within the vSwitch.  So in the diagram, if A and D are running on the same ESX and are on the same VLAN, they can be in the same port group and none of the traffic between them will leave the host.  For this reason, any VMs that send high amounts of data over the network to each other, we will often add DRS affinity rules to keep them on the same host.",

I expect that the vSwitch split horizon bridging will drop this frame.  Maybe it doesn&#39;t?",

There&#39;s no disagreement there.<br /><br />But I disagree with &quot;Each VM appears to be single-homed to one of the switches.&quot;<br /><br />From the pSwitch perspective, each VM is homed to an *aggregation*, and MAC learning will happen on the aggregation, regardless of the link member where they arrive.<br /><br />Taking just the left pSwitch, all of A&#39;s frames will arrive on link member 0 and all of C&#39;s frames will arrive on link member 1...  But the pSwitch won&#39;t notice this.  The pSwitch will associate both MACs with the aggregate interface, and will forward downstream frames according to whichever hashing method is configured, totally ignoring which MAC showed up on which link member.<br /><br />Traffic won&#39;t flow across the inter-switch link.  It will flow *down* the aggregate, and only *maybe* get delivered to the VMs.",
