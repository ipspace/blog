Too bad, because it&#39;s juniper, there are not many docs about it available yet. Oh and you can find pretty decent descuss about it at j-nsp@pucknet",

But it is still closer to the Siamese Twins. You still need to connect to single or dual &quot;fabric switches&quot; and then I believe there is also a controller module which handles all of the management. I&#39;m also guessing that you can only have two of these in a QFabric &quot;domain&quot;?<br /><br />It sounds like a good architecture, but due to the lack of in-depth &quot;how this all works&quot; documents I&#39;m still skeptical.",

Forklift upgrade, or new installs make the most sence<br />2. Protocols that are running between the elements are OSPF based, but proprietary<br />3. No over-subscription in a normal setup(I would imagine there are failure scenarios where it still is the case)<br />4. Can operate on DSCP/CoS values of the packets ingressing its ports.<br />5. QF/I a big fabric boxes, not many smart things happen there",

For example, when a server connects to the fabric for the first time, all switches in the fabric learn about that server. In this way, fabric switches can be added or removed and physical or virtual servers can be relocated\u2014without the fabric requiring manual reconfiguration<br />....<br />And, unlike switch stacking technologies, the Ethernet Fabric is masterless. This means that no single switch stores configuration information or controls fabric operations",

The VSS/IRF  cluster is a single device from the control/management prospective and under certain conditions f.e. when traffic becomes CPU switched (have had this with VSS) the full cluster meltdown follows immediately. funny enough, it is almost impossible to test it in the lab, even under the load.<br /><br />After going through the paper is appears to me that only Cisco vPC, Brocade VSS on VDX 6700 and Brocade/Foundry MCT run independent switches with some _proprietary_ protocol between to provide for MLAG functionality.
