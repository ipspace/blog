In addition you can add real time geo-location, carrier and device data. The results are sent to an online HAR view where you can see waterfall charts and if you click on the HAR tab at the top of the page you get to see additional information about the device.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Peter<br />5o9mm.com",
