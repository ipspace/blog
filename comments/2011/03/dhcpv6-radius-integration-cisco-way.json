      "html": "Aha, wish you&#39;d posted this a few weeks ago back when I was trying to set this up!  I just finished a v6 deployment for a DSL ISP and thorougly enjoyed the nice disconnect between the v6 RADIUS attributes and real life.  There are ways around the problem of the second username with the -dhcpv6 suffix though, it just requires some experimentation.  I&#39;ve finally got mine working the way I want, which is fully dynamic local to the NAS, with RADIUS driven static PDs without the second username.  The trick is to disable the nd framed-ipv 6-prefix on the virtual template, and number the customer WAN interface with a peer default statement pointing to a dhcpv6 pool.  Then you can deliver the ipv6 prefix out of radius from the original user account and not have to duplicate. <br /><br />Fun times!",

It&#39;s been an interesting discovery process, one I&#39;ll no doubt repeat over many IOS versions in the years to come.. loving this post series btw.",
