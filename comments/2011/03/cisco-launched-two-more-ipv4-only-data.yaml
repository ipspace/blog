  html: If the FWSM only supports IPv6 on the main CPU then it can handle about 100
    - 200 Mbps of traffic. At that point, CPU will be 100% and firewall will be dropping
    traffic or failing. <br /><br />Effectively, this means it doesn&#39;t actually
    &quot;work&quot; with IPv6 at all.

  html: For more details, read the FWSM-related comments to this post http://blog.ioshints.info/2010/11/ipv6-in-data-center-after-year-cisco-is.html<br
    /><br />Looks like FWSM can handle a bit more than 100 Mbps, but it&#39;s very
    far off from the IPv4 performance.

  html: Nexus 5000 isn&#39;t a L3 platform. It doesn&#39;t have IPv4 routing either.
    The data sheet says it does support IPv6 ACLs but I haven&#39;t read what the
    limitations are

  html: The 5k now has the ability to do routing with the new 5.0(3)N1 code and the
    L3 expansion modules/daughtercards. Just came out.  <br /> <br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/release/notes/Rel_5_0_3_N1_1/Nexus5000_Release_Notes_5_0_3_N1_1_1a.html#wp316417

  html: Where we are at with NAT-PT ? It was implemented in IOS quite a few years
    ago but it has never made it into ASA code...
