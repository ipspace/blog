            <div class="comment-content">Absolutely agree with all you say. Do you see a simpler solution satisfying the following business requirements:<br /><br />(A) Using IP connectivity (MPLS/VPN services or otherwise) from multiple SPs and being completely independent from them and their (in)capabilities of supporting customer&#39;s routing and convergence requirements;<br />(B) Encrypting sensitive traffic;<br />(C) Maintaining strict isolation between departments.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I dont mean to get in a conflict here or something and please dont take this personally as I just expressed an thought that came in my mind. O:-)<br /><br />These conditions &quot;completely independent from ISP&quot; and &quot;(in)capabilities ....&quot;. Its like someone thinks of them as the greatest expert and just dont believe in anyone else&#39;s capabilites. I understand that there are incapabilites dealing with ISP but as I said, we have to work with people as well (to get things resolved) rather than going around people.<br /><br />For instance, If I think that my organzation&#39;s network team is not capable enough to handle STP/L3 Routing issues. Then I can just configure some workaround through Flex Links or EEM to do the job. I am sure somebody can come up with a working solution but the real solution is to get the right people or train the exisitng ones.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Now is my time to say &quot;I didn&#39;t want this to become confrontational&quot;. Obviously I was having a harried day yesterday  O:-)<br /><br />Unfortunately, the reality of MPLS/VPN services (as offered by some SPs) is that they simply cannot satisfy the customers&#39; needs. If the only routing option a SP offers is &quot;OSPF or static routes&quot; and you want to use two SPs, you&#39;re (almost) stuck.<br /><br />It&#39;s not that the engineers working for that particular SP would be bad. They are usually pretty good engineers and some of them are great people. However, they have to live with the business reality (read: service definition) of their organization and can&#39;t help you even when they would know how to.<br /><br />Anyhow, thanks for the nudges - you gave me food for at least 3 additional blog posts on this topic.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">One of the biggest problems with MPLSoDMVPN is around the establishment of spoke to spoke tunnels, ie it is not really supported.  So voice for example has some issues, going back via a hub is not always ideal.<br /><br />Now there is this:<br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/interface/configuration/guide/ir_mplsvpnomgre.html#wp1074480 <br /><br />NHRP and and IGP is no longer needed and the NBMA address is gleaned fro BGP.  This combined with GET VPN really gives me hope for MPLSomGREoIPSEC. <br /><br />I have labbed it up and it seem to work fantastically.  The only thing that is hard to deal with is MTU and ensuring that the encryption is always done in the fast path by not fragmenting after gre encapulation or after encryption.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">There are at least three ways (documented in my webinar, together with tested lab configs) to get spoke-to-spoke traffic flowing directly in MPLSoDMVPN environment ... but admittedly you might stumble across someone claiming it&#39;s not supported (that&#39;s always a great excuse when trying not to focus on the problem).<br /><br />MPLS over mGRE is another great solution (also covered in my webinar  8-) ) which works best when you have only MPLS traffic. If you have to add a few VPNs on top of existing DMVPN network, it&#39;s hard to justify re-engineering the whole network. Also, GETVPN is not working on Cat 6500 (at least it did not when I last checked), which many people use as the hub encryption platform.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&quot;not supported&quot; was the official stance from out cisco account rep about 6 months ago.<br /><br />But we did get it going in the lab.<br /><br />We would be looking to deploy with asr 1000 hubs and 3900/asr 1000 series spokes.<br />That said I havent checked the latest XE to see if it has support.<br /><br />How do you think the best way to tackle mtu?  We may be fortunate where we have a core layer behind the spoke pe to reduce the mtu there as we cannot fragment at the same time as label imposition with the above feature.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I would usually set the MTU (+ mpls mtu if needed) on the GRE tunnel interface, which would cause the ingress PE-router to fragment original packets (or send back an ICMP reply) before labeling and encryption. Combined with &quot;ip tcp mss&quot; it solves almost all problems (oversized UDP packets might still be a problem, but usually minor).<br /><br />Are you saying this does not work for you? If so, what&#39;s the problem?</div>
