            <div class="comment-content">I was thinking it may had come from this direction http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/2010/10/31/DatacenterNetworksAreInMyWay.aspx - Brad Hedlund linked to this article from one of his posts about datacenters -  but I don&#39;t see Amazon listed in this initiative :) While James Hamilton may sound inconvenient to many with his opinion, his anger is actually understandable from his point of view.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Some good (and amusing!) points on the buzz/hype surrounding SDN, though it&#39;s not the first time I&#39;ve heard vendor and pet press suggest that they could alter the constants of physics  :)<br /><br />I&#39;d read a little bit about OpenFlow/SDN before they became an &quot;industry consortium&quot;, and it does look like an interesting technology, even though it won&#39;t help you determine the vitals of Schrödinger&#39;s Cat.  I see it as more of a testbed platform, at least initially, that would allow the evolution of large-scale network protocols - think IPv8 - on a global basis, in much shorter timeframes.  As you correctly stated, methods exist to do this today, but they aren&#39;t simple, and they aren&#39;t necessarily universal.  I see OpenFlow as having the potential to bring these capabilities down to the enthusiast level, increasing the number of testers and allowing managers and administrators to build their knowledge and work out bugs along with those individuals or teams who have the greatest interest and generally some of the most useful feedback.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">That&#39;s exactly one of my counter-arguments: MLS in any incarnation I&#39;ve seen so far (be it from Cisco, Cabletron or anyone else) has failed miserably. Why should it work this time?<br /><br />However, per-flow MLS-like behavior is just one of the potential applications. You can also use OpenFlow for numerous other things, like downloading (static, pre-computed) L3 routing tables into switches or set up MPLS VCs across a SP network (MPLS-TP folks will love that  :-E )</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Interesting take on this. I agree that what&#39;s in print seems a bit perplexing. <br /><br />What little I&#39;ve seen on the topic that was coherent shrieked &quot;academic&quot; to me. Everything I&#39;ve seen so far sounded like new control plane, maybe new routing logic in the routing entities. I like the comment already posted about development. Doing plugin code might make sense for that. The API for interfacing with hardware chipsets (e.g. for packet recognition) might get interesting too. Without low-level hardware interaction, you sure as heck aren&#39;t going to improve performance as far as I can see. <br /><br />I can see some benefits. To pick an example, Cisco Multi-Topology Routing seems to have been done once over lightly with no visible recent  further progress (or I missed it). As I understood it, it sounded like matching QoS criteria and selecting forwarding table based on that. That&#39;s some pretty hardware-specific code I&#39;d think. I suspect Cisco isn&#39;t pursuing it as a priority since it&#39;s a technical solution with increased complexity solving a problem that only a few have. Well, if it were open source, so to speak, then someone who cared could finish fleshing out that feature set (turning all routers into commodities?). How do the bugs get worked out? How does the code get rendered efficient? And can that happen quickly?  <br /><br />Can you imagine troubleshooting hand-crafted site-specific code problems in a production network? Let&#39;s not even go there... <br /><br />One of the problems I see in IT right now is WAY too many combinations of web / middleware / DB, software, load balancers, routing designs, etc., etc. Everything is a one-off, and you have an exponential explosion of combinations even in one datacenter. Heck, I keep doing work at sites where various projects brought in every Server Load Balancing technique / vendor I&#39;ve ever heard of -- and staff has to expend cycles learning about and supporting all of them! Now add routing variations? Yecch. I&#39;d sure like a darn good reason before that happens!</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Although, like you, I am skeptical that we&#39;ll ever see true &#39;inter-controllable&#39; networks, I do think there are lots of powerful capabilities that are enabled via SDNs. Specifically, the kinds of multi-tenant networks that are going to be needed when infrastructure stretches across different organizations, IaaS and other service providers are going to need something fundamentally different that what&#39;s being offered today. On the flip side if all you&#39;ve got to deal with is your own enterprise network, not sure SDN has much to offer.</div>
