      "html": "Hi Ivan I have a question because we are intending our cisco  BRAS asr1006, which is currently supporting dual stack, to send the user\u00b4ipv6 prefix during accounting request to our radius using framed-ipv6-prefix type 97 and that unfortunately doesnt happen. Do you know if there is any command similar to the junipers: <br />radius include framed-ipv6-prefix <br />\u25a0Use to include the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix attribute in Access-Request, Acct-Start, or Acct-Stop messages. <br />\u25a0You can control inclusion of the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix attribute by enabling or disabling this command.<br />So that we can solve our current problem?<br /><br />If you need I can give you more detail of the BRAS configuration.<br /><br />I lokk forward to hearing from you asap.<br />best regards,<br />Javier<br />PD: sorry for my english i am from argentina",

      "html": "Hi Ivan! Yes that\u00b4s right! in accounting records for an issue of billing. If you remmember, for IPv4 according to RFC2866 reference 4.1 Accounting-request it says   &quot;  If the Accounting-Request packet includes a Framed-IP-Address,   that attribute MUST contain the IP address of the user.  If the       Access-Accept used the special values for Framed-IP-Address telling the NAS to assign or negotiate an IP address for the user,  the Framed-IP-Address (if any) in the Accounting-Request MUST<br />      contain the actual IP address assigned or negotiated.&quot;<br /><br />In our case for ipv4 broadband services the BRAS sends the ipv4\u00b4s user so that way our systems keep records for billing and other stuff as for instance lawfull intercept etc.  So it is not our idea for IPv6 that prefix delegation function will be in the radius in the near future but this will go on in the BRAS as today we are doing for our trial. What are we doing?<br />So far we are doing a broadband ipv6 trial that has just started june 8th and will end up in November. The users are 25 employees from my company and the broadband service belongs to my company. So far the service is working fine with the exception of the detail I have told you that I need to solve and for which I am a bit confused. <br />Really thank for your answer Ivan!<br />Best regards,<br />Javier :)",
