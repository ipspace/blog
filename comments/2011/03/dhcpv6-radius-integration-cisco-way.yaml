  html: Aha, wish you&#39;d posted this a few weeks ago back when I was trying to
    set this up!  I just finished a v6 deployment for a DSL ISP and thorougly enjoyed
    the nice disconnect between the v6 RADIUS attributes and real life.  There are
    ways around the problem of the second username with the -dhcpv6 suffix though,
    it just requires some experimentation.  I&#39;ve finally got mine working the
    way I want, which is fully dynamic local to the NAS, with RADIUS driven static
    PDs without the second username.  The trick is to disable the nd framed-ipv 6-prefix
    on the virtual template, and number the customer WAN interface with a peer default
    statement pointing to a dhcpv6 pool.  Then you can deliver the ipv6 prefix out
    of radius from the original user account and not have to duplicate. <br /><br
    />Fun times!

  html: Great trick. Thank you! Works nicely 15.0M. It seems 12.2SRE has a bug - it
    advertises framed-ipv6-prefix in RA and DHCPv6 IA_PD reply (totally confusing
    the CPE).

  html: Oh balls, what a mess.  I have an extensive list of v6 RADIUS attributes and
    av-pairs that my LNS either handles incorrectly, or rejects, or accepts then ignores
    haha.  It&#39;s been an interesting discovery process, one I&#39;ll no doubt repeat
    over many IOS versions in the years to come.. loving this post series btw.
