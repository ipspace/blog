Found my problem and thought I&#39;d come back and leave a breadcrumb trail to it in case anyone else encounters a similar issue and finds this post early on.<br /><br />If you have an access-class applied to your VTY lines (you -do- have an access-class on your VTY lines, don&#39;t you? ;) ) and need to SSH to a non-VRF interface as well as a VRF interface, you&#39;ll need to adjust the access-class configuration on your vty lines as follows:<br />access-class &lt;number&gt; in vrf-also<br /><br />This would be less common in an MPLS VPN scenario than in an Internet-based VPN scenario, as it would be uncommon for a service provider to be connecting from both their address space and customer address space.  In the Internet VPN scenario, there are some instance where connectivity may be required to either interface.<br /><br />The vrf-also directive is documented at the very bottom of the following page.<br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/asr1000/configuration/guide/chassis/Management_Ethernet.html&lt;/number&gt;",
