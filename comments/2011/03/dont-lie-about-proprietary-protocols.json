      "html": "&quot;However, it\u2019s crucial to understand which parts of a solution (or which protocols) are proprietary and which are standard and interoperable with other vendors.&quot;<br /><br />Ok that me laugh, because some manufacturers that make &quot;carrier grade&quot; equipment can&#39;t get the standards right so that their own equipment works properly, let alone with another manufacturers equipment. When you phone them and they say &quot;no, no, no don&#39;t use MSTP!&quot; you realise that even they know their implementation is badly broken.<br /><br />Why half implement a standard? Don&#39;t they realize it&#39;s not standards compliant if they only half implement it? I&#39;ll take a working proprietary protocol over a broken standards implementation any day!",

      "html": "If they&#39;re using FSPF, what&#39;s that do to the SAN fabric (which MUST be stable, etc.)? All of a sudden you&#39;re loading VLAN and MAC information into FSPF, adding LAN link instability (greater than SAN networks, I assume), increasing the size of the link database considerably ... my crystal ball says scaling that could get ugly! Brocade&#39;s SAN customers should maybe be a bit concerned. <br /><br />What this also says to me is that Brocade is taking the code they have (which presumably at least works) having seen the difficulty of building new protocols they historically may not have in their code base. Could they be planning on shifting TRILL to IS-IS later? Is this a time-to-market move? (Tempted to say, kluge -- one could argue one SPF is as good as another I suppose, not sure I&#39;d buy that argument.)",

How is talking about a roadmap for future IS-IS in the control plane a lie?   I don&#39;t get it.  It sounds like Brocade is being very explicit and truthful.",

      "html": "Hi,<br /><br />First of all, thanks for your feedback!<br /><br />Saying &quot;we use TRILL framing in the data plane&quot; is perfectly OK. I must have missed this very precise definition in your whitepapers; if that&#39;s the case, I apologize - I would also appreciate a link to the document describing exactly which parts of your implementation are complaint with TRILL.<br /><br />Saying &quot;Brocade fabric uses TRILL protocol&quot; is not OK. TRILL has numerous components and in my humble opinion you cannot claim to &quot;use TRILL&quot; if you use just the framing format. It&#39;s like claiming you use OSI protocols just because your link-layer encapsulation is LAPB (and you might run IP with OSPF on top of that).<br /><br />I cannot comment on whether &quot;clarifying the use of FSPF in the control plane&quot; is or is not a lie; I assume it&#39;s true.<br /><br />If you would have said &quot;we&#39;re already using TRILL framing format, so we will be ready to deploy TRILL when the IS-IS-related drafts are ratified and will require only software upgrade; in the meantime we decided to use FSPF&quot; I would have applauded your honesty. Your marketing people have unfortunately decided to claim something completely different.",

Please visit http://www.brocade.com/products/all/routers/index.page for more details.<br /><br />What&#39;s needed is the ratification of the modifications to IS-IS for layer 2 support required to use it with the TRILL standard.
