  html: As always Ivan, this is a good post. In FreeRADIUS I would suggest adding
    your !* checks into a Group config and adding all -dhcpv6 users to that group
    to save mistyping those commands.<br /><br />I will be adding this to my RADIUS
    setups tomorrow :) Great catch.<br /><br />Unrelated I guess, but in the past
    I have used the NAS-Port-Id on a PPPoE LAC to ensure that certain users could
    only login from certain VLANS. (I had a college with Student and Staff networks
    and wanted restrict accounts to certain vlans).

  html: This is the OPPOSITE of the cisco documentation I found, which specifically
    said that it was the same password!  Which explains why I could never get the
    -dhcpv6 username to authenticate.  I ended up finding a number of workarounds
    to this, but my favourite answer was the one I commented on the other post.  What
    a niiiiiightmare.

  html: 'Now I remember my discovery process:<br /><br />Step #1 - read the documentation<br
    />Step #2 - try &amp; fail<br />Step #3 - Debug RADIUS to figure out RFC 4818
    is not supported AT ALL in ANY IOS release (might work with IOS XE)<br />Step
    #4 - use Wireshark to find out what the true password is<br />Step #5 - Try to
    figure out how to persuade FreeRADIUS to accept empty password (included a lengthy
    visit to the source code ... sometimes open source products make great sense)'

  html: Hi Ivan:<br />Did you try this combination for IPv6 address assignment:<br
    />1.RA To Distribute CPE Wan IPv6 Prefix via Radius<br />2.DHCPv6 PD To Distribute
    CPE Lan IPv6 Prefix<br /><br />Thanks.
