      "html": "As always Ivan, this is a good post. In FreeRADIUS I would suggest adding your !* checks into a Group config and adding all -dhcpv6 users to that group to save mistyping those commands.<br /><br />I will be adding this to my RADIUS setups tomorrow :) Great catch.<br /><br />Unrelated I guess, but in the past I have used the NAS-Port-Id on a PPPoE LAC to ensure that certain users could only login from certain VLANS. (I had a college with Student and Staff networks and wanted restrict accounts to certain vlans).",

      "html": "This is the OPPOSITE of the cisco documentation I found, which specifically said that it was the same password!  Which explains why I could never get the -dhcpv6 username to authenticate.  I ended up finding a number of workarounds to this, but my favourite answer was the one I commented on the other post.  What a niiiiiightmare.",
