My blog is hosted @ blogger, so I guess you can already access it over IPv6 if your ISP has the agreement with Google. <br /><br />As for the web site, I would need to clone the existing VM that hosts a number of other things into ioshints-hints-specific one and enable IPv6 on it. At least I know there are no showstoppers and all the preparatory work has already been done (we have PI prefix, it&#39;s multihomed, IPv6 is running in our DMZ ...).",

We manage a couple of networks in higher education and my &#39;customers&#39; are 100% between 18-28. The last count of iphones during the last 7 days in our network showed a total of 7,5%, so i guess our &#39;customers&#39; are indeed part of the major audiance t-mobile, etc. are aiming for.<br />Speaking from our experiances: the internet is not down when Youtube or facebook are unreachable (though they make quite an amount of total traffic), but when Google is unreachable!<br />I hence do not believe a comercial telco provider would get anywhere without delivering a consistent ability to not only reach Google, Youtube, Facebook and a couple of other sites, but also every link a Google Search, bit.ly, Twitter, etc. shows up.<br />Even though I find the &quot;my customers will go elsewhere&quot;-view intruiging, my experiance with end users and our data do not support the sense of urgency this view implies.<br />Having to balance my visions of a connected future with pure cost/benefit considerations, regarding the implementation of IPv6 I see a lot of initiative penalty on the side of T-Mobile &amp; Co. and no urgency to follow up with them so quickly for the rest of the world.",

      "html": "&quot;After all, they already run large-scale NAT (LSN) in NAT44 mode and changing that to NAT64 can\u2019t be much worse&quot;<br /><br />I am not completely agree with that. Do you remember how long did it take to make popular apps run through NAT44? 3-5 years ago I do remember that some IMs could not run through NAT. Now most of the applications are ok, even if we use NAT444 (you can refer to draft-donley-nat444-impacts-01).<br /><br />My idea is that it will take a lot of time to make NAT64 mature. And in the moment it is MUCH worse comparing to NAT44 (and even to NAT444). There are some NAT64 trials, there is draft-tan-v6ops-nat64-experiences-00 describing some impressions of NAT64, but I am not sure about any large-scale deployments. <br /><br />Anyways, I will be happy to know I am wrong  8-)",

In the meantime, (some) app developers have realized it&#39;s not a good idea to carry IP addresses in application messages without some additional mechanisms.<br /><br />There&#39;s even a standard way to build NAT-traversing applications (STUN) and NAT64 was developed by the same working group and should work well with STUN. Any well-written application should thus work as easily over NAT64 as it does over NAT44 ... which brings us to another problem: many applications (anything browsers-based obviously excluded) simply haven&#39;t realized (yet) that there&#39;s a new address family you have to take in account.<br /><br />I don&#39;t have any first-hand information about large-scale NAT64 trials.
