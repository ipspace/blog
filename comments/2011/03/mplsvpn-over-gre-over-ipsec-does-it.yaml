  html: One of the &quot;Critical Things&quot; that people tend to forget while doing
    anything (Anytihng means all domains in life including Developing Apps, Configuring
    networks, civil engineering etc) is the simplest way to find the solution is THE
    best solution. <br /><br />But unfortunately, the general perception is that the
    more complex you get, the most expert you are. :( I agree with the expert part
    but not an Intelligent Expert. 8-)

  html: Absolutely agree with all you say. Do you see a simpler solution satisfying
    the following business requirements:<br /><br />(A) Using IP connectivity (MPLS/VPN
    services or otherwise) from multiple SPs and being completely independent from
    them and their (in)capabilities of supporting customer&#39;s routing and convergence
    requirements;<br />(B) Encrypting sensitive traffic;<br />(C) Maintaining strict
    isolation between departments.

  html: I dont mean to get in a conflict here or something and please dont take this
    personally as I just expressed an thought that came in my mind. O:-)<br /><br
    />These conditions &quot;completely independent from ISP&quot; and &quot;(in)capabilities
    ....&quot;. Its like someone thinks of them as the greatest expert and just dont
    believe in anyone else&#39;s capabilites. I understand that there are incapabilites
    dealing with ISP but as I said, we have to work with people as well (to get things
    resolved) rather than going around people.<br /><br />For instance, If I think
    that my organzation&#39;s network team is not capable enough to handle STP/L3
    Routing issues. Then I can just configure some workaround through Flex Links or
    EEM to do the job. I am sure somebody can come up with a working solution but
    the real solution is to get the right people or train the exisitng ones.

  html: 'Now is my time to say &quot;I didn&#39;t want this to become confrontational&quot;.
    Obviously I was having a harried day yesterday  O:-)<br /><br />Unfortunately,
    the reality of MPLS/VPN services (as offered by some SPs) is that they simply
    cannot satisfy the customers&#39; needs. If the only routing option a SP offers
    is &quot;OSPF or static routes&quot; and you want to use two SPs, you&#39;re (almost)
    stuck.<br /><br />It&#39;s not that the engineers working for that particular
    SP would be bad. They are usually pretty good engineers and some of them are great
    people. However, they have to live with the business reality (read: service definition)
    of their organization and can&#39;t help you even when they would know how to.<br
    /><br />Anyhow, thanks for the nudges - you gave me food for at least 3 additional
    blog posts on this topic.'

  html: There is a very large deployment at a company called first data. They use
    2547overDMVPN and cisco is well aware of this deployment. ASR platforms are being
    used to deliver high performance routing in this environment.

  html: One of the biggest problems with MPLSoDMVPN is around the establishment of
    spoke to spoke tunnels, ie it is not really supported.  So voice for example has
    some issues, going back via a hub is not always ideal.<br /><br />Now there is
    this:<br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/interface/configuration/guide/ir_mplsvpnomgre.html#wp1074480
    <br /><br />NHRP and and IGP is no longer needed and the NBMA address is gleaned
    fro BGP.  This combined with GET VPN really gives me hope for MPLSomGREoIPSEC.
    <br /><br />I have labbed it up and it seem to work fantastically.  The only thing
    that is hard to deal with is MTU and ensuring that the encryption is always done
    in the fast path by not fragmenting after gre encapulation or after encryption.

  html: There are at least three ways (documented in my webinar, together with tested
    lab configs) to get spoke-to-spoke traffic flowing directly in MPLSoDMVPN environment
    ... but admittedly you might stumble across someone claiming it&#39;s not supported
    (that&#39;s always a great excuse when trying not to focus on the problem).<br
    /><br />MPLS over mGRE is another great solution (also covered in my webinar  8-)
    ) which works best when you have only MPLS traffic. If you have to add a few VPNs
    on top of existing DMVPN network, it&#39;s hard to justify re-engineering the
    whole network. Also, GETVPN is not working on Cat 6500 (at least it did not when
    I last checked), which many people use as the hub encryption platform.

  html: '&quot;not supported&quot; was the official stance from out cisco account
    rep about 6 months ago.<br /><br />But we did get it going in the lab.<br /><br
    />We would be looking to deploy with asr 1000 hubs and 3900/asr 1000 series spokes.<br
    />That said I havent checked the latest XE to see if it has support.<br /><br
    />How do you think the best way to tackle mtu?  We may be fortunate where we have
    a core layer behind the spoke pe to reduce the mtu there as we cannot fragment
    at the same time as label imposition with the above feature.'

  html: I would usually set the MTU (+ mpls mtu if needed) on the GRE tunnel interface,
    which would cause the ingress PE-router to fragment original packets (or send
    back an ICMP reply) before labeling and encryption. Combined with &quot;ip tcp
    mss&quot; it solves almost all problems (oversized UDP packets might still be
    a problem, but usually minor).<br /><br />Are you saying this does not work for
    you? If so, what&#39;s the problem?

  html: Ivan,<br /><br />This is a very impressive combination of technologies used
    to create a cool solution, but for example would this be the way to go for a Tier
    2 or 3 ISP that didn&#39;t have deep enough pockets to run it&#39;s own Layer
    1 connectivity (DWDM/SDH etc...) and instead chose to get IP services from T1
    providers in the form of MPLS Psuedowires?<br /><br />Thanks,

  html: Pseudowires are probably a better choice in your scenario. MPLS-over-GRE is
    really useful only when you have no other transport option but IP connectivity.

    html: 'Per-VRF DMVPN tunnel is perfectly doable and works well if the number of
      VRFs is small (but remember: you&#39;ll also have to run a routing protocol
      per VRF).'

    a DWVPN per VRF, if less then say 3?  Is that possible?

  html: I am having issues with MPLS over GRE on PFC3B that equipped the SUP32, does
    it actually work/supported. SUP32 datasheet indicates it does with some less performance
    as compared to SUP720.<br /><br />Any comments/suggestion will be really helpfull,
    Many thansk in advance.
