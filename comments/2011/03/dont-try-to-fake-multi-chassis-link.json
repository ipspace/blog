      "html": "Ivan,<br />Can you please clarify something for me?<br />You say &quot;If one of the links fails, static LAG will not detect link failure&quot;. Are you saying that if we don&#39;t use LACP or PAGP and instead use &#39;channel-group 1 mode on&#39;, for example, and a link in etherchannel fails, some traffic will be dropped? As in packets are still load balanced over the dead link??<br />Or is this an HP thing?",

Thus, the Cisco switches see each others BPDUs in two different ports and one of those is made STP blocking. If the blocking port is a port facing X, then ~half of the traffic sent to upstream by X is blackholed.",
