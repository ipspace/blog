  html: But why link to the site, giving it more credence in Google&#39;s eyes?<br
    /><br />Although the site appears be run by a Romanian, the hosting company is
    based in the US. DMCA time. :)

  html: The guy&#39;s used a &#39;article spinner&#39;. Google it, you&#39;ll find

  html: What&#39;s strange is the reason to copy and &#39;spin&#39; others content
    is to drive traffic and get people to click on ads on your site. This site has
    no ads.

  html: Ivan, do you remember the search query that brought you to this iceberg of
    wizdom in the first place ?<br /><br />If yes - then a prudent thing to do would
    be https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/spamreport?hl=en - to hopefully make
    him part with his adsense account - which will both bat in some clue and remove
    the economic incentive for cluelessness. (Assuming, in good faith, that the said
    page is not null-routed :)

  html: I&#39;ve been getting the same recently, even though my site isn&#39;t exactly
    a mecca for visitors yet. <br /><br />The first one I managed to get the guy to
    remove. The second I can&#39;t even find contact details. The main problem was
    that I had all kinds of lovely graphs in my post, which looked completely screwed
    up on the other site
