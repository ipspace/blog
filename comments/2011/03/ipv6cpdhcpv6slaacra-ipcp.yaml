    with enough complexities to learn IPv6? Any design or topology guidance?

  html: Enterprise or SP focus? For enterprise, a few routers and switches, a server
    (web, DNS, DHCP) or two and a few clients (Windows, OSX, Linux, iPad) should be
    more than enough. IPv6 connectivity to the global Internet is a definite plus.
