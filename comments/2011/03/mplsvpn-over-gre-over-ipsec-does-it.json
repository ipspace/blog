Do you see a simpler solution satisfying the following business requirements:<br /><br />(A) Using IP connectivity (MPLS/VPN services or otherwise) from multiple SPs and being completely independent from them and their (in)capabilities of supporting customer&#39;s routing and convergence requirements;<br />(B) Encrypting sensitive traffic;<br />(C) Maintaining strict isolation between departments.",

O:-)<br /><br />These conditions &quot;completely independent from ISP&quot; and &quot;(in)capabilities ....&quot;. Its like someone thinks of them as the greatest expert and just dont believe in anyone else&#39;s capabilites. I understand that there are incapabilites dealing with ISP but as I said, we have to work with people as well (to get things resolved) rather than going around people.<br /><br />For instance, If I think that my organzation&#39;s network team is not capable enough to handle STP/L3 Routing issues. Then I can just configure some workaround through Flex Links or EEM to do the job. I am sure somebody can come up with a working solution but the real solution is to get the right people or train the exisitng ones.",

Obviously I was having a harried day yesterday  O:-)<br /><br />Unfortunately, the reality of MPLS/VPN services (as offered by some SPs) is that they simply cannot satisfy the customers&#39; needs. If the only routing option a SP offers is &quot;OSPF or static routes&quot; and you want to use two SPs, you&#39;re (almost) stuck.<br /><br />It&#39;s not that the engineers working for that particular SP would be bad. They are usually pretty good engineers and some of them are great people. However, they have to live with the business reality (read: service definition) of their organization and can&#39;t help you even when they would know how to.<br /><br />Anyhow, thanks for the nudges - you gave me food for at least 3 additional blog posts on this topic.",

So voice for example has some issues, going back via a hub is not always ideal.<br /><br />Now there is this:<br />http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/interface/configuration/guide/ir_mplsvpnomgre.html#wp1074480 <br /><br />NHRP and and IGP is no longer needed and the NBMA address is gleaned fro BGP.  This combined with GET VPN really gives me hope for MPLSomGREoIPSEC. <br /><br />I have labbed it up and it seem to work fantastically.  The only thing that is hard to deal with is MTU and ensuring that the encryption is always done in the fast path by not fragmenting after gre encapulation or after encryption.",

If you have to add a few VPNs on top of existing DMVPN network, it&#39;s hard to justify re-engineering the whole network. Also, GETVPN is not working on Cat 6500 (at least it did not when I last checked), which many people use as the hub encryption platform.",
