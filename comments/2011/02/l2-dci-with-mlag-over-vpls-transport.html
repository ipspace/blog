            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />If the reference is to my suggestion to use two VPLS instances, then I didn&#39;t have in mind running LAG over them. :) I thought of rather using them as two L3 links and doing whatever you normally would (like run your own MPLS on top of it). :)<br /><br />I usually don&#39;t recommend solutions which may or may not work; hence my suggestion to use either PBB or more radically OM-5130 (which runs GFP over Ethernet/IP), as these solutions don&#39;t have dependence on service provider&#39;s capabilities to pass L2 control protocols.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I did come across a few cases when an SP doesn&#39;t support Ethernet OAM, and on top of than will block your OAM frames, too.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&quot;I thought of using 2 VPLS instances as two L3 links&quot; - but that&#39;s no fun; we know how to handle that. <br /><br />BTW, having two VPLS services from the same SP instead of one might slightly reduce redundancy (you can&#39;t survive two worst-case access-layer failures). Having two VPLS services from two SPs is obviously a totally different story.<br /><br />Last but definitely not least, obviously it&#39;s time to look into OM-5130. PBB does not solve the problem, it just introduces another layer of addressing (which does solve some other problems, but not this one).</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&gt; you can&#39;t survive two worst-case access-layer failures<br /><br />Care to elaborate? Depending on how big and fibre-rich your provider is (and how deep your pockets are), you could potentially get your four access links going to four different POPs, with no common elements whatsoever. With smaller providers, of course, there&#39;s risk that you&#39;ll land up sharing at least some infrastructure.<br /><br />&gt; PBB does not solve the problem<br /><br />I guess in my definition of &quot;solve&quot; it does not - it is vendor-dependent. Some vendors allow creation of MAC-in-MAC p2p (UNI to UNI) tunnels, which don&#39;t implement any L2 processing on incoming frames (just encapsulate them and ship them over, no matter what they were - control or data). But yes, it is not universal so doesn&#39;t count. :)<br /><br />&gt; it&#39;s time to look into OM-5130<br /><br />If you did look at my presentation from CEW APAC &#39;10 (I posted link in one of my responses some time ago), there was a mention of work being done at ADVA. Last year I was working with their guys on feasibility of including MPLS-based tunneling into an NTU-sized device, and there was some progress. This reminds me to get back in touch with them to see what&#39;s happening, as this discussion is a clear use case. ;)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">LACP over EoMPLS does work for 6500.  12.2(33)SXI3, Sup720-3BXL, 6748 w/DFC3. It will forward UDLD, STP, CDP to the other end. <br /><br />One thing I noticed was setting EXP via service policy would not affect UDLD,STP,CDP packets. They would be set to EXP 7 where as the rest of the traffic was EXP 5 per the service policy.<br /><br />To get decent reaction to one side of the one of the links going down, you need to use UDLD. Routing protocol would be preferred.</div>

Pretty sure there would be other implementations out there - mainly where the equipment wasn&#39;t designed as a switch from the beginning (like for example 7600/6500/Nexus) and implements bridging as a &quot;value-add&quot; function.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hmm, funny - just looked at the CCIE Quick Overview Kit you&#39;ve linked to today, and it noticed that L2PT now supports LACP/PaGP (&quot;l2protocol-tunnel point to point&quot; command). So there you go - you&#39;ll need three ports on your edge switch for each VPLS connection:<br /><br />1) port to connect to a VPLS<br />2) exit port for QinQ<br />3) your &quot;edge&quot; port (that you&#39;d normally connect to a VPLS).<br /><br />Port 1 is connect to an SP&#39;s demarc;<br />Port 2 is connected to Port 3.<br /><br />Port 1 carries only one VLAN - one you use on Port 2 as QinQ VLAN ID<br />Port 2 is configured as QinQ with L2PT p2p for PaGP/LACP<br /><br />Replicate for the second SP VPLS and at the other DC.<br /><br />Configure 2 x Port 3 as a member of LAG.<br /><br />Pray it all works as expected! :)</div>
