  html: I&#39;m boggled. Why transport FC over MPLS natively ? It&#39;s bad enough
    that FC exists at all. Instead of solving problems in the protocol they said &quot;network
    must be lossless&quot; and avoided all the hard work. <br /><br />Of course, the
    fact that FC networking costs ten times a data network would not be a motivating
    factor would it  ? After all, they needed to design their own fibre optic cabling,
    high end xcvrs, lossless forwarding fabrics etc etc. <br /><br />However, I&#39;m
    mightily impressed by the use of the legacy technology to make it work. The more
    cruft they slap on, the better it will be. We will be making a fortune out of
    this idiocy. <br /><br />fantastic.

  html: Ivan,<br /><br />Great post. FC should go and more people are realizing that
    nowdays. If you were to start a PHD today what would be your thesis?
