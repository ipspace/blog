      "html": "Ivan,<br /><br />The multi vendor strategy isn&#39;t just about cost. I suspect that in some cases, having 2 players in a space can lower your cost because you can choose the ideal vendor for each installation and get better pricing. There are also other benefits, in that a critical flaw in 1 vendors code won&#39;t impact the other (see cisco long AS path handling flaws, various Junos FIB update delays in MX, etc.). If you have a big enough network that is going to be multivendor anyways to get best of breed different applications, you can split the fixed cost of working with that vendors OS over multiple products. <br /><br />For example, once you have vendor A in your edge switching, you already have staff with knowledge of their OS, have already integrated them into your various OSS systems and have a set of contacts there. If you add them to the vendor mix elsewhere, like core or PE, you can recycle a lot of that investment. It does however add some cost and time to your certification process, in that you now have to test new configs on two platforms.<br /><br />And perhaps the biggest advantage is that if one vendor makes a strategy change and drops your chosen product from their roadmap, you don&#39;t have 3-6 months of zero deployments while to work out the commerical and technical issues with a new supplier (or 3-6 months of buying dead-end hardware). You just switch your urgent deployments to vendor B while you replace vendor A&#39;s discontinued product.",
