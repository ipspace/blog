  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />If the reference is to my suggestion to use two VPLS instances,
    then I didn&#39;t have in mind running LAG over them. :) I thought of rather using
    them as two L3 links and doing whatever you normally would (like run your own
    MPLS on top of it). :)<br /><br />I usually don&#39;t recommend solutions which
    may or may not work; hence my suggestion to use either PBB or more radically OM-5130
    (which runs GFP over Ethernet/IP), as these solutions don&#39;t have dependence
    on service provider&#39;s capabilities to pass L2 control protocols.<br /><br
    />Speaking of which, I did come across a few cases when an SP doesn&#39;t support
    Ethernet OAM, and on top of than will block your OAM frames, too.

  html: LACP is for p2p links so VPLS is the wrong service for that. Even with an
    EoMPLS pseudowire the only L2 protocols a 7600 can forward are dtp, vtp, stp,
    cdp.

  html: BTW I tested on 7600 with ES+ cards and LACP does not work with EoMPLS pseudowire
    or VPLS.

  html: '&quot;I thought of using 2 VPLS instances as two L3 links&quot; - but that&#39;s
    no fun; we know how to handle that. <br /><br />BTW, having two VPLS services
    from the same SP instead of one might slightly reduce redundancy (you can&#39;t
    survive two worst-case access-layer failures). Having two VPLS services from two
    SPs is obviously a totally different story.<br /><br />Last but definitely not
    least, obviously it&#39;s time to look into OM-5130. PBB does not solve the problem,
    it just introduces another layer of addressing (which does solve some other problems,
    but not this one).'

  html: So you can&#39;t have two parallel EoMPLS PWs bundled into a MLAG? Ouch ...

  html: What about EoL2TPv3oVPLS with P2P-VPLS links...? I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s
    transparent enough for LACP/PAgP, but maybe it would work. However, such a &quot;solution&quot;
    is nothing I would recommend...  ;)

  html: '&gt; you can&#39;t survive two worst-case access-layer failures<br /><br
    />Care to elaborate? Depending on how big and fibre-rich your provider is (and
    how deep your pockets are), you could potentially get your four access links going
    to four different POPs, with no common elements whatsoever. With smaller providers,
    of course, there&#39;s risk that you&#39;ll land up sharing at least some infrastructure.<br
    /><br />&gt; PBB does not solve the problem<br /><br />I guess in my definition
    of &quot;solve&quot; it does not - it is vendor-dependent. Some vendors allow
    creation of MAC-in-MAC p2p (UNI to UNI) tunnels, which don&#39;t implement any
    L2 processing on incoming frames (just encapsulate them and ship them over, no
    matter what they were - control or data). But yes, it is not universal so doesn&#39;t
    count. :)<br /><br />&gt; it&#39;s time to look into OM-5130<br /><br />If you
    did look at my presentation from CEW APAC &#39;10 (I posted link in one of my
    responses some time ago), there was a mention of work being done at ADVA. Last
    year I was working with their guys on feasibility of including MPLS-based tunneling
    into an NTU-sized device, and there was some progress. This reminds me to get
    back in touch with them to see what&#39;s happening, as this discussion is a clear
    use case. ;)'

  html: LACP over EoMPLS does work for 6500.  12.2(33)SXI3, Sup720-3BXL, 6748 w/DFC3.
    It will forward UDLD, STP, CDP to the other end. <br /><br />One thing I noticed
    was setting EXP via service policy would not affect UDLD,STP,CDP packets. They
    would be set to EXP 7 where as the rest of the traffic was EXP 5 per the service
    policy.<br /><br />To get decent reaction to one side of the one of the links
    going down, you need to use UDLD. Routing protocol would be preferred.

  html: LACP doesn&#39;t work, but you could probably force it on. I can try tomorrow
    in our lab. As you already said though, you would risk blackholing traffic and
    I haven&#39;t played with CFM and OAM enough to know whether that could help.

  html: '#1: Assuming your SP hasn&#39;t deployed redundancy gear on your site, one
    failure in VPLS-A access link and one failure in VPLS-B access link (in the other
    site) would bring down the whole DCI.<br /><br />#2: Interesting. Which vendor(s)
    would that be? You know I&#39;m too Cisco-focused.'

  html: See the comment from Killian; he got UDLD across EoMPLS, which should be enough.

  html: '#1: That would be a double failure, and having these two services from two
    different SPs won&#39;t be much help, no?<br /><br />#2: I&#39;m reasonably sure
    Alcatel&#39;s ESS/SR can do it; and if I&#39;m not mistaken some of Nortel&#39;s
    Ethernet gear could do it, too. Pretty sure there would be other implementations
    out there - mainly where the equipment wasn&#39;t designed as a switch from the
    beginning (like for example 7600/6500/Nexus) and implements bridging as a &quot;value-add&quot;
    function.'

  html: Hmm, funny - just looked at the CCIE Quick Overview Kit you&#39;ve linked
    to today, and it noticed that L2PT now supports LACP/PaGP (&quot;l2protocol-tunnel
    point to point&quot; command). So there you go - you&#39;ll need three ports on
    your edge switch for each VPLS connection:<br /><br />1) port to connect to a
    VPLS<br />2) exit port for QinQ<br />3) your &quot;edge&quot; port (that you&#39;d
    normally connect to a VPLS).<br /><br />Port 1 is connect to an SP&#39;s demarc;<br
    />Port 2 is connected to Port 3.<br /><br />Port 1 carries only one VLAN - one
    you use on Port 2 as QinQ VLAN ID<br />Port 2 is configured as QinQ with L2PT
    p2p for PaGP/LACP<br /><br />Replicate for the second SP VPLS and at the other
    DC.<br /><br />Configure 2 x Port 3 as a member of LAG.<br /><br />Pray it all
    works as expected! :)

  html: There are all sorts of things you can do with loopback cables, but I would
    like to avoid them. They are probably no better than VPLSoMPLSoVPLS (there might
    be a marginal benefit depending on what your HW platform is)
