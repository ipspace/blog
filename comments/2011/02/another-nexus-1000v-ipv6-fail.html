            <div class="comment-content">Fail for sure especially because there are a number of enterprises/governments that have been putting IPv6 support as a mandatory requirement. But also, like you mentioned, we have multiple vendors in the market so I&#39;m sure we can skip Cisco if we want so it&#39;s not the end of the road.<br /><br />But what I think it&#39;s happening is that even VSphere IPv6 support is not at the same level as IPv4 (but getting there) so Cisco might be thinking: - the market is not going to migrate from IPv4 to IPv6 tomorrow, maybe not even during next 12 months...  slowly  they&#39;ll introduce it but the biggest market share will still cover IPv4 scenarios so we have one, maybe two, years in front of us to come up with a new Nexus xxxxV product line.<br /><br />Or maybe I&#39;m wrong and they just don&#39;t care!</div>

            <div class="comment-content">IPv6 was perhaps not mentioned in the keynotes.<br />However, in almost all sessions (atleast the ones I went to), weather they were related to IPv6 in some way or not, IPv6 was mentioned. And in general the audience was very aware of this, because for products that do not have IPv6 capability there were always some people asking &quot;ok, but what about IPv6&quot;, in every session that I attended.<br />(And it seems that the ace team is going to do something about this as well... even though they are &quot;a bit&quot; behind...)<br />And wireless network at Live was ipv4/ipv6, so we had native ipv6 internet connectivity.</div>
