A external call is received in Office A and is then transferred over a trunk link to an extension in Offfice B at the other side of town. The call is then transferred back to another extension in Office A. Two of the limited intersite trunk links are then in use and it can get worse if the call is then transferred back to et another extension in Office B. We had just 6 intersite links in those days.",
