      "html": "agreed with Oleg.<br /><br />Here is description:<br /><br />string match pattern string <br />See if pattern matches string; return 1 if it does, 0 if it doesn&#39;t. Matching is done in a fashion similar to that used by the C-shell. For the two strings to match, their contents must be identical except that the following special sequences may appear in pattern: <br /><br />* <br />Matches any sequence of characters in string, including a null string. <br /><br />? <br />Matches any single character in string. <br /><br />[chars] <br />Matches any character in the set given by chars. If a sequence of the form x-y appears in chars, then any character between x and y, inclusive, will match. <br /><br />\\x <br />Matches the single character x. This provides a way of avoiding the special interpretation of the characters *?[]\\ in pattern.",
