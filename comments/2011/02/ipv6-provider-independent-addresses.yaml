  html: Which ISPs have a max prefix length of a /32?  This page:<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_IPv6_support_by_major_transit_providers<br
    />shows only /48.<br /><br />I think most ISPs at this time are board with a /48.<br

  html: '@Frank: I think that /48 is for prefixes from PI space. Like Ivan said, many
    (most?) ISPs won&#39;t accept routes longer than /32 from PA space, which makes
    sense.<br /><br />@Ivan: AFAICT the simple desire to multihome provides justification
    to the RIRs for at least a /48. A couple of the docs I&#39;ve found at RIPE suggest
    that this decision was made specifically to lower the barrier to adoption of IPv6
    for smaller organizations.'

  html: '@Stretch: you&#39;re correct. ARIN has substantially the same policy (although
    it&#39;s a bit more convoluted to find) - you have to &quot;demonstrate an intent
    to announce the requested space in a multihomed fashion to two or more distinct
    ASNs not owned or controlled by the end-user&quot;, which usually means (at least)
    having an AS.<br /><br />The IPv6 PI allocation policy is (almost?) identical
    to IPv4 PI allocation policy (in ARIN&#39;s case, an amendment to the IPv6 policy
    states you can get PI IPv6 prefix if you would be eligible to get IPv4 PI prefix).'

  html: It would be really useful to know what ISPs are filtering on /32 boundaries
    for PA space - are you aware of a list, or documentation from such ISPs?<br /><br
    />I&#39;ve been trying to find such a list/document, and have even asked some
    ISPs, but none (of the ones I have asked) have any policies in place yet.<br /><br
    />I would really appreciate more information on this - as I know some places which
    are hoping to split their PA /32 into /40s (or longer).

  html: in my humble opinion, the IPV6 addressing hierarchy must be preserved in order
    to maintain the manageability of the global routing table. LISP looks promising,
    although there are still some technical issues yet to be solved. there are already
    beta networks running on LISP, but not much heard on the results and reviews.
    From your opinion, will the global Internet community accepts LISP? Will it be
    a reality in 2-3 years from now?

  html: The IPv6 addressing hierarchy and corresponding aggregability is a lost battle.
    We&#39;ll either deploy a kludge like LISP or the global BGP routing tables will
    explode.
