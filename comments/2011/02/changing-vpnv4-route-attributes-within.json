From the receiving PE an import map statement must be configured to prefer which Soo will be chosen while leaving the one as a backup default route",

The same applies to standard communities in any BGP implementation.  For example: deterministic routing in multicarrier L3VPN where you&#39;re the CE.<br /><br />In the above, you could just as easily have the network &quot;customers&quot; stamp standard communities on the DC CE routers and let them deterministically route their own traffic without having to bother the MPLS operators.",

Or am I missing something.<br /><br />Probably the easiest way to achieve independence from the PEs would be to set up your own (customer) mesh of LSPs using the carrier&#39;s underlying MPLS network and avoid the PE&#39;s decision. Something like RSVP-TE over L3VPN over MPLS. I never tried anything like that so it&#39;s just a thought (just made a quick search on google and looks like someone is already proposing this over IETF...)",
