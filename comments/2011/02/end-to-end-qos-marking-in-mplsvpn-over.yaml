  html: as far as i can remember, the default behavior when imposing labels is indeed
    to reflect the precedence to exp. On the eLER the default will be to remove the
    label stack WITHOUT copying the exp back to precedence - hence, Cisco IOS use
    the (short) pipe model.<br /><br />But maybe they changed this default some place
    along the IOS way<br /><br />my 2 cent

  html: Yep, only TTL is copied from IP header to MPLS header at the ingress LSR (subject
    to fading memory  :-P ).

  html: Interesting Ivan, however I found the exact opposite when checking MPLS QoS
    labels... http://davidrothera.co.uk/cisco/2011/02/mpls-qos-marking-the-rebuttal/

  html: Thank you for the feedback. I was using 15.0M, so it looks like the change
    in behavior was pretty recent.

  html: 'Update: Looks like I was doing something wrong during my lab tests. I repeated
    the tests today and MPLS/VPN-over-DMVPN works as we all expected. Reworded the
    post.'

  html: So we had &quot;IPv4/v6 over MPLS over GRE over IPSec over XXX&quot;<br />together
    with Short Pipe since 12.4T. it&#39;s working. <br />with 15T we have discovered
    a &quot;NEW&quot; mapping feature <br />&quot;Marking Copy from GRE to IPSec&quot;.<br
    />In our case it is very good in order to signal QoS-Marking into<br />transmissions
    networks. (e.g. 4SLA)...

  html: Hasn&#39;t the GRE-to-IPsec ToS copying worked &quot;forever&quot;? Tunnel-mode
    IPsec might be an issue, but transport-mode IPsec should work out-of-the-box.

  html: we used IPSec default (tunnel-mode) and now &quot;mode transport require&quot;<br
    />if possible...<br />BTW a little challenge was also ISIS in this QoS context
    -&gt; IPSec ToS = 0.
