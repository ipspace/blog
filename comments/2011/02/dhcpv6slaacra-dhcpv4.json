Well done, bye bye control...<br /><br />We did not found anything to change this behavior. <br /><br />regards<br />Dietmar",

But I&#39;ll give it a try anyways.<br />I&#39;m trying to assign a few ip v6 addresses to a single interface on Red Hat.<br />I want &#39;N&#39; ipv6 addresses answering on eth0 since I have multiple server instances running; each requiring its own ipv6 address.<br /><br />Is something like this doable:<br />1. Option 1<br />eth0:1 =&gt; autoconfig EUI-64 (since I have a single MAC address for the i/f)<br />eth0:2 =&gt; autoconfig privacy extension (rfc4941)<br />eth0:3 =&gt; autoconfig privacy extension (rfc4941)<br />eth0:4 =&gt; autoconfig privacy extension (rfc4941)<br />...<br /><br />2. Option 2<br /><br />eth0:1 =&gt; autoconfig privacy extension (rfc4941)<br />eth0:2 =&gt; autoconfig privacy extension (rfc4941)<br />eth0:3 =&gt; autoconfig privacy extension (rfc4941)<br />eth0:4 =&gt; autoconfig privacy extension (rfc4941)<br />...<br /><br />I&#39;m trying yo avoid static IP.<br /><br />Thanks",

But it\u00b4s not the best idea to disable IPv6 private addressing for a roaming notebook all the time in terms of tracking and security (neverless i dont know if the system is using DHCP or SLACC address for outgoing connections)<br />Some of our customer are still stuck in IPv4 operating practices. Sometimes they using fixed IP DHCP assignments together with firewall rules. I know that this practices is not the best one, but at this time i did not find any possible solution to bring such option to a IPv6 network while supporting Windows and Mac OS X clients....",
