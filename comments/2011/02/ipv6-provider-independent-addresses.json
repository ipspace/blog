ISPs won&#39;t accept routes longer than /32 from PA space, which makes sense.<br /><br />@Ivan: AFAICT the simple desire to multihome provides justification to the RIRs for at least a /48. A couple of the docs I&#39;ve found at RIPE suggest that this decision was made specifically to lower the barrier to adoption of IPv6 for smaller organizations.",

ARIN has substantially the same policy (although it&#39;s a bit more convoluted to find) - you have to &quot;demonstrate an intent to announce the requested space in a multihomed fashion to two or more distinct ASNs not owned or controlled by the end-user&quot;, which usually means (at least) having an AS.<br /><br />The IPv6 PI allocation policy is (almost?) identical to IPv4 PI allocation policy (in ARIN&#39;s case, an amendment to the IPv6 policy states you can get PI IPv6 prefix if you would be eligible to get IPv4 PI prefix).",

LISP looks promising, although there are still some technical issues yet to be solved. there are already beta networks running on LISP, but not much heard on the results and reviews. From your opinion, will the global Internet community accepts LISP? Will it be a reality in 2-3 years from now?",
