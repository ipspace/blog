  html: Hopefully we&#39;ll see some BGP Add-Path implemented in more &quot;real production&quot;
    deployments along with PIC :) It&#39;s been a while since they have been kicking
    it down the IETF hallways...

  html: Who am I to go against the community-agreed terminology ;) Changed the heading
    and the text (thank you!).<br /><br />Also, you HAVE TO enable IBGP multipath
    on PE-C and PE-D, otherwise they will not install additional BGP routes into the
    VRF routing table. Somehow I had the feeling it wasn&#39;t needed, but a quick
    lab test proved otherwise.

    html: Yes, because the RDs are different, so these two routes look like totally
      different VPNv4 prefixes.

    html: Keep in mind that without add-path the route reflector selects a single
      route and propagates its best route to its clients.

  html: Hi Ivan, I did a simple lab and looks with route reflector it did not work
    with different metric values. May be I did something wrong?
