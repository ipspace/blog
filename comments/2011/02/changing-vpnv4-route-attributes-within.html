            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />    Why not use using Soo from from the two Datacenter PE which will be advertise into the MPLS cloud and then using an import map on the receiving PE. From the receiving PE an import map statement must be configured to prefer which Soo will be chosen while leaving the one as a backup default route</div>

            <div class="comment-content">You can also run those communities through a regex and create a single uniform routing policy for all route on all routers.  The same applies to standard communities in any BGP implementation.  For example: deterministic routing in multicarrier L3VPN where you&#39;re the CE.<br /><br />In the above, you could just as easily have the network &quot;customers&quot; stamp standard communities on the DC CE routers and let them deterministically route their own traffic without having to bother the MPLS operators.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">SOO would also work, in fact I&#39;m assuming the SOO is already being set to avoid routing loops on the data center sites. On the other hand, every prefix has a RT (route-target) so it&#39;s an easy win.<br /><br />One interesting challenge would be to control the PE choice of which default to follow based on announces of the CEs attached to the PE. But this is tricky and would not work in all cases.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Even if the CE stamps the default using different communities you would need to add configuration to the PEs to prefer on default over the other. Or am I missing something.<br /><br />Probably the easiest way to achieve independence from the PEs would be to set up your own (customer) mesh of LSPs using the carrier&#39;s underlying MPLS network and avoid the PE&#39;s decision. Something like RSVP-TE over L3VPN over MPLS. I never tried anything like that so it&#39;s just a thought (just made a quick search on google and looks like someone is already proposing this over IETF...)</div>

Would need some serious EEM hacking to make it work; probably not worth it.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">#1 - You&#39;re absolutely correct. The IP forwarding decision is made by the PE-router - as soon as the CE sends an IP packet to the PE, it has no influence on its forwarding any more. The default route selection must be made by the PE-router.<br /><br />#2 - You don&#39;t need TE. Carrier&#39;s Carrier architecture would work just fine.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I have a &quot;similar&quot; scenario, but do not have control of the configs on the PE... I have default route originating in multiple places, I want to control which one is preferred and choose one of the others as a secondary.  I am trying to &quot;steer&quot; it with as-path depth but it seems that only one default route will be taken in regardless of length.  This does not seem to be the same behavior displayed by other &quot;non default&quot; routes.  Can&#39;t believe I&#39;m the only one doing this, there must be a guide somewhere to help me fix this?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Could you show how you set could and would recommend setting the additional route target extcommunity on the datacenter PE routers?<br /><br />for example:  Is this being done on the data center PEs by:<br /> - route-map of some kind?<br /> - just adding an additional export &lt;additional:rt_value&gt; which is then matched in route-map on the PE routers which the remote offices are attached to?<br /><br /><br />In a similar problem, suppose you have not preferred, but conflicted routes such that in one acquisition integration, 192.168.1.0/24 is used for service A in Region A, while in a different, since integrated, acquisition company, 192.168.1.0/24 is used for service B in Region B.  Suppose there is not alot of appetite for solutions to resolve using  re-IP, and suppose you must make the routes for things in Region A which conflict with Region B available in their respective regions, but not in other...<br /><br />It seems like adding a RT value to the exported routes could be used as a marker (tag, community) to then be used in a route-map in the other regions to mark the know conflicted routes and prevent their import in the other regions where the conflict occurs...<br /><br />What do you think?<br /><br />Sam &lt;/additional:rt_value&gt;</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Jeffrey,<br /> <br />   Correct. The only way for you to be able to select which default route will be accepted is through the SP (in your case AT&amp;T). Typically you can just ask you&#39;re account team with AT&amp;T that this kind of scenario is what you would like to happen. I often dealt this often with AT&amp;T <br />     ;)</div>
