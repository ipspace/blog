  html: It&#39;s just marketing, now buy new datacenter equipment and the we will
    sell you new with IPv6 support. Easy as that.

  html: 'Fail for sure especially because there are a number of enterprises/governments
    that have been putting IPv6 support as a mandatory requirement. But also, like
    you mentioned, we have multiple vendors in the market so I&#39;m sure we can skip
    Cisco if we want so it&#39;s not the end of the road.<br /><br />But what I think
    it&#39;s happening is that even VSphere IPv6 support is not at the same level
    as IPv4 (but getting there) so Cisco might be thinking: - the market is not going
    to migrate from IPv4 to IPv6 tomorrow, maybe not even during next 12 months...  slowly  they&#39;ll
    introduce it but the biggest market share will still cover IPv4 scenarios so we
    have one, maybe two, years in front of us to come up with a new Nexus xxxxV product
    line.<br /><br />Or maybe I&#39;m wrong and they just don&#39;t care!'

  html: IPv6 was perhaps not mentioned in the keynotes.<br />However, in almost all
    sessions (atleast the ones I went to), weather they were related to IPv6 in some
    way or not, IPv6 was mentioned. And in general the audience was very aware of
    this, because for products that do not have IPv6 capability there were always
    some people asking &quot;ok, but what about IPv6&quot;, in every session that
    I attended.<br />(And it seems that the ace team is going to do something about
    this as well... even though they are &quot;a bit&quot; behind...)<br />And wireless
    network at Live was ipv4/ipv6, so we had native ipv6 internet connectivity.
