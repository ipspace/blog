            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I agree that forwarding packets based on l3 should be called routing. Why whould that change just because the hardware changes, it doesn&#39;t matter if an ASIC or a CPU is doing the forwarding, it&#39;s still routing. The term layer 3 switcing is probably invented to show that there is a difference between a conventional router and a switch doing routing and that switching the packets must be much faster than routing them! On this note I found it interesting when I was doing a lab on frame-relay (preparing for CCIE) and the debug command is called debug frame-relay packet, since when is frame-relay a packet technology? :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan, speaking as someone who was working as a Network Engineer during all those sorry events you describe, I can confirm that it was the Marketing people who got us in this mess (the same marketing people who describe FastEthernet as 200Mbps throughput, factually correct but totally misleading).  I can distinctly remember sitting in Cisco presentations being told of the wonders &#39;Layer3 Switching&#39; and feeling deeply troubled.  I had urges to stand up and tell them... &#39;this is routing, not switching&#39;.... I looked around to see if anyone else felt the same, but everyone else was sat there, open mouthed, slightly dribbling, mumbling like Homer Simpson....&quot;I want a layer3 switch&quot;.... There job was done, more confusion followed and Cisco&#39;s share price jumped again.<br />l</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Switching is an old term dating back way before layer 3 networks and OSI IP stacks were born.  Remember the days of Frames and x.25 when transistors literally switched in a regular interval, whether or not data packets were queued or not.  It&#39;s an old TDM term, likely ~80 years old- and is why it&#39;s most prevalent on legacy voice environments and since been applied to virtualized software based switching technologies.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Please pardon the tangent. A lot of IT people fall into the profession, and much of our knowledge is built on direct exposure, either through scraping our knuckles on our networks, researching technologies / problems and studying for certifications. One thing that is missing is the historical knowledge of the people that preceded us. As I was reading this article, it occurred to me that our industry has been around long enough that the problems and their solution methods are becoming cyclical, everything old is new again. I very much enjoy learning how the problems I run into now, have been solved (for better and for worse) in the past and having a historical understanding of what works and what doesn&#39;t (and why). It is akin to other fields where they teach a historical component so each generation doesn&#39;t reinvent the wheel. Are there texts or other sources to gain a solid understanding of networking&#39;s past successes and failures?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Often I see people struggling to define the difference between the processes of routing and bridging. The key to me is that routing is the process of finding a path between two nodes in a graph. Here graph is a collection of nodes and links and path is ordered sequence of nodes to be traversed to reach the destination. Bridging, on contrast, is simply stitching or joining two links in one, i.e. changing connectivity property in the graph. This is why it is so hard to compare the two processes directly - they apply to different entities. <br /><br />Of course, for the purpose of advanced bridging, a link could be viewed as having complex structure, which, in turn, implements path determination and routing on its own. But I believe that understanding how this two processes apply to different entities is helpful.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">ACM has histories of published articles. How many of them are relevant? How many of them were purely academic exercises? Written to get a paper published? How many actual events happened (or decisions got made) without being glorified in an ACM paper?<br /><br />You could use ACM or IEEE archives to as one of the sources of your research. I hope someone will once take the time to do that and write a good historical overview. What I&#39;ve seen from John Day was unfortunately too biased.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Heh, is there any historical review that is NOT biased? :) John Day is definitely exaggerating some things and his obsession with &quot;naming problem&quot; may be annoying at times, but so far his work is the only attempt to analyze the fundamentals of protocol design. The book is definitely not easy, though interesting reading. Arguable, but that&#39;s what I like it for.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ah ! but is layers 3 forwarding really the same as routing ? Each packet isn&#39;t inspected and does pass thru all the same verifications. There is a major difference. L3 forwarding is more like L2.5 , only the first packet is routed , until theres a change, then the rest are switched. <br /><br /><br />The hardware configurations are totally different , and the uses of routers and L3 switches isnt the same.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I dont think you know what your talking about ... Wouldnt be the first time eh. Please do some research<br /><br />There is an IEEE journal title Annals of the History of Computing ... Theres loads of articles there about the birth of X25 and all the assorted public networks (cyclades) etc etc and the thoughts governing why they choose this and that ....<br />Also IETF have several RFC&#39;s documenting the history of deployment of various protocols in live environments<br />ACM and IEEE are not just repositories for abstracts ..<br /><br /> Thats the problem with networking ..any old hack can step up and get involved ..... unlike say programming where you at least need to have the talent to deal with the abstract and appreciate the   foundations of computing  .... networking is just all arithmetic these days.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Thanks for the tip. Will definitely investigate, I would love to know the background of a few things that have always irritated me. <br /><br />As for &quot;wouldn&#39;t be the first time&quot; - you&#39;re right, I make mistakes (but I never claimed I&#39;m omniscient ;) ), but then one of the best parts of my blogging experience is that I learn something new on a daily basis based on your comments.<br /><br />Last but definitely not least, while it would be interesting to compare networking and programming (where I have seen a fair share of programmers that fall way short of your definition of minimum needs), I will not enter into a pissing contest with an anonymous commenter.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&quot;Thats the problem with networking ...any old hack can step up and get involved ... unlike say programming where you at least need to have the talent to deal with the abstract and appreciate the foundations of computing&quot; - Quite funny.  Spoken like a programmer.  Unfortunately, the Internet is littered with the &quot;talent&quot; of hack programmers.  I&#39;m surprised anyone who can spell IEEE and IETF would overlook that.<br /><br />Having had many years in both the programming and networking realms, I think that there is little difference between the clueful folk in either discipline.  Likewise at the shallow end of the pool.<br /><br />While you may not have intended to be brusque (giving you the benefit of the doubt) in your reply, you would do well to show a little courtesy to someone who spends a great of time trying to help educate people.  Pointing out mistakes can be done without being insulting.</div>
