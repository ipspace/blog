  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I agree that forwarding packets based on l3 should be
    called routing. Why whould that change just because the hardware changes, it doesn&#39;t
    matter if an ASIC or a CPU is doing the forwarding, it&#39;s still routing. The
    term layer 3 switcing is probably invented to show that there is a difference
    between a conventional router and a switch doing routing and that switching the
    packets must be much faster than routing them! On this note I found it interesting
    when I was doing a lab on frame-relay (preparing for CCIE) and the debug command
    is called debug frame-relay packet, since when is frame-relay a packet technology?
    :)

  html: Ivan, speaking as someone who was working as a Network Engineer during all
    those sorry events you describe, I can confirm that it was the Marketing people
    who got us in this mess (the same marketing people who describe FastEthernet as
    200Mbps throughput, factually correct but totally misleading).  I can distinctly
    remember sitting in Cisco presentations being told of the wonders &#39;Layer3
    Switching&#39; and feeling deeply troubled.  I had urges to stand up and tell
    them... &#39;this is routing, not switching&#39;.... I looked around to see if
    anyone else felt the same, but everyone else was sat there, open mouthed, slightly
    dribbling, mumbling like Homer Simpson....&quot;I want a layer3 switch&quot;....
    There job was done, more confusion followed and Cisco&#39;s share price jumped
    again.<br />l

    network.  We just put packets on it.

  html: Switching is an old term dating back way before layer 3 networks and OSI IP
    stacks were born.  Remember the days of Frames and x.25 when transistors literally
    switched in a regular interval, whether or not data packets were queued or not.  It&#39;s
    an old TDM term, likely ~80 years old- and is why it&#39;s most prevalent on legacy
    voice environments and since been applied to virtualized software based switching
    technologies.

  html: Please pardon the tangent. A lot of IT people fall into the profession, and
    much of our knowledge is built on direct exposure, either through scraping our
    knuckles on our networks, researching technologies / problems and studying for
    certifications. One thing that is missing is the historical knowledge of the people
    that preceded us. As I was reading this article, it occurred to me that our industry
    has been around long enough that the problems and their solution methods are becoming
    cyclical, everything old is new again. I very much enjoy learning how the problems
    I run into now, have been solved (for better and for worse) in the past and having
    a historical understanding of what works and what doesn&#39;t (and why). It is
    akin to other fields where they teach a historical component so each generation
    doesn&#39;t reinvent the wheel. Are there texts or other sources to gain a solid
    understanding of networking&#39;s past successes and failures?

  html: This is a fantastic question with no good answer. I&#39;m not aware of any
    book that I could recommend. There are classic texts (like Jeff Doyle&#39;s Routing
    TCP/IP), but not much on the history of internetworking.

    by John Day. His views might be arguable, but he provides very interesting historical
    review.

  html: Often I see people struggling to define the difference between the processes
    of routing and bridging. The key to me is that routing is the process of finding
    a path between two nodes in a graph. Here graph is a collection of nodes and links
    and path is ordered sequence of nodes to be traversed to reach the destination.
    Bridging, on contrast, is simply stitching or joining two links in one, i.e. changing
    connectivity property in the graph. This is why it is so hard to compare the two
    processes directly - they apply to different entities. <br /><br />Of course,
    for the purpose of advanced bridging, a link could be viewed as having complex
    structure, which, in turn, implements path determination and routing on its own.
    But I believe that understanding how this two processes apply to different entities
    is helpful.

  html: This is a great post, and there are some very relevant and insightful comments
    following it.<br /><br />I&#39;m a fairly young engineer and really got my teeth
    sinking into the technologies around 1996-1997.  I cut my teeth on a small Novell
    network and slowly went on from there.  As already mentioned, seeing the history
    of how things came about (and more importantly, the taint of marketing) really
    helps to put terminology and sometimes even the technology in perspective.  I
    remember when I just started struggling to understand the differences between
    some protocols (such as ISL vs 802.1q) only much later to find out the history.  Of
    course, it puts everything into perspective.<br /><br />Another thought that came
    to mind is the understanding (or lack thereof) of some even senior people of the
    technology.  We&#39;re talking true &quot;understanding&quot;.  Sometimes getting
    a few of my peers to really understand the difference between layer 2 and layer
    3 is difficult.  Then there is the guy that refers to any &quot;switch&quot; as
    a &quot;hub&quot;; those are the times when you just have to learn to interpret
    someone&#39;s language.  :)<br /><br />Great post!

  html: ACM has histories of published articles. How many of them are relevant? How
    many of them were purely academic exercises? Written to get a paper published?
    How many actual events happened (or decisions got made) without being glorified
    in an ACM paper?<br /><br />You could use ACM or IEEE archives to as one of the
    sources of your research. I hope someone will once take the time to do that and
    write a good historical overview. What I&#39;ve seen from John Day was unfortunately
    too biased.

  html: Heh, is there any historical review that is NOT biased? :) John Day is definitely
    exaggerating some things and his obsession with &quot;naming problem&quot; may
    be annoying at times, but so far his work is the only attempt to analyze the fundamentals
    of protocol design. The book is definitely not easy, though interesting reading.
    Arguable, but that&#39;s what I like it for.

  html: Ah ! but is layers 3 forwarding really the same as routing ? Each packet isn&#39;t
    inspected and does pass thru all the same verifications. There is a major difference.
    L3 forwarding is more like L2.5 , only the first packet is routed , until theres
    a change, then the rest are switched. <br /><br /><br />The hardware configurations
    are totally different , and the uses of routers and L3 switches isnt the same.

  html: I dont think you know what your talking about ... Wouldnt be the first time
    eh. Please do some research<br /><br />There is an IEEE journal title Annals of
    the History of Computing ... Theres loads of articles there about the birth of
    X25 and all the assorted public networks (cyclades) etc etc and the thoughts governing
    why they choose this and that ....<br />Also IETF have several RFC&#39;s documenting
    the history of deployment of various protocols in live environments<br />ACM and
    IEEE are not just repositories for abstracts ..<br /><br /> Thats the problem
    with networking ..any old hack can step up and get involved ..... unlike say programming
    where you at least need to have the talent to deal with the abstract and appreciate
    the   foundations of computing  .... networking is just all arithmetic these days.

  html: Thanks for the tip. Will definitely investigate, I would love to know the
    background of a few things that have always irritated me. <br /><br />As for &quot;wouldn&#39;t
    be the first time&quot; - you&#39;re right, I make mistakes (but I never claimed
    I&#39;m omniscient ;) ), but then one of the best parts of my blogging experience
    is that I learn something new on a daily basis based on your comments.<br /><br
    />Last but definitely not least, while it would be interesting to compare networking
    and programming (where I have seen a fair share of programmers that fall way short
    of your definition of minimum needs), I will not enter into a pissing contest
    with an anonymous commenter.

    Quite funny.  Spoken like a programmer.  Unfortunately, the Internet is littered
    with the &quot;talent&quot; of hack programmers.  I&#39;m surprised anyone who
    can spell IEEE and IETF would overlook that.<br /><br />Having had many years
    in both the programming and networking realms, I think that there is little difference
    between the clueful folk in either discipline.  Likewise at the shallow end of
    the pool.<br /><br />While you may not have intended to be brusque (giving you
    the benefit of the doubt) in your reply, you would do well to show a little courtesy
    to someone who spends a great of time trying to help educate people.  Pointing
    out mistakes can be done without being insulting.'
