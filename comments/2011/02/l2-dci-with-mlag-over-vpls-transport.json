Having two VPLS services from two SPs is obviously a totally different story.<br /><br />Last but definitely not least, obviously it&#39;s time to look into OM-5130.

      "html": "&gt; you can&#39;t survive two worst-case access-layer failures<br /><br />Care to elaborate? Depending on how big and fibre-rich your provider is (and how deep your pockets are), you could potentially get your four access links going to four different POPs, with no common elements whatsoever. With smaller providers, of course, there&#39;s risk that you&#39;ll land up sharing at least some infrastructure.<br /><br />&gt; PBB does not solve the problem<br /><br />I guess in my definition of &quot;solve&quot; it does not - it is vendor-dependent. Some vendors allow creation of MAC-in-MAC p2p (UNI to UNI) tunnels, which don&#39;t implement any L2 processing on incoming frames (just encapsulate them and ship them over, no matter what they were - control or data). But yes, it is not universal so doesn&#39;t count. :)<br /><br />&gt; it&#39;s time to look into OM-5130<br /><br />If you did look at my presentation from CEW APAC &#39;10 (I posted link in one of my responses some time ago), there was a mention of work being done at ADVA. Last year I was working with their guys on feasibility of including MPLS-based tunneling into an NTU-sized device, and there was some progress. This reminds me to get back in touch with them to see what&#39;s happening, as this discussion is a clear use case. ;)",

It will forward UDLD, STP, CDP to the other end. <br /><br />One thing I noticed was setting EXP via service policy would not affect UDLD,STP,CDP packets. They would be set to EXP 7 where as the rest of the traffic was EXP 5 per the service policy.<br /><br />To get decent reaction to one side of the one of the links going down, you need to use UDLD.
