      "html": "I&#39;m boggled. Why transport FC over MPLS natively ? It&#39;s bad enough that FC exists at all. Instead of solving problems in the protocol they said &quot;network must be lossless&quot; and avoided all the hard work. <br /><br />Of course, the fact that FC networking costs ten times a data network would not be a motivating factor would it  ? After all, they needed to design their own fibre optic cabling, high end xcvrs, lossless forwarding fabrics etc etc. <br /><br />However, I&#39;m mightily impressed by the use of the legacy technology to make it work. The more cruft they slap on, the better it will be. We will be making a fortune out of this idiocy. <br /><br />fantastic.",
