  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />    Why not use using Soo from from the two Datacenter
    PE which will be advertise into the MPLS cloud and then using an import map on
    the receiving PE. From the receiving PE an import map statement must be configured
    to prefer which Soo will be chosen while leaving the one as a backup default route

  html: 'You can also run those communities through a regex and create a single uniform
    routing policy for all route on all routers.  The same applies to standard communities
    in any BGP implementation.  For example: deterministic routing in multicarrier
    L3VPN where you&#39;re the CE.<br /><br />In the above, you could just as easily
    have the network &quot;customers&quot; stamp standard communities on the DC CE
    routers and let them deterministically route their own traffic without having
    to bother the MPLS operators.'

  html: SOO would also work, in fact I&#39;m assuming the SOO is already being set
    to avoid routing loops on the data center sites. On the other hand, every prefix
    has a RT (route-target) so it&#39;s an easy win.<br /><br />One interesting challenge
    would be to control the PE choice of which default to follow based on announces
    of the CEs attached to the PE. But this is tricky and would not work in all cases.

  html: Even if the CE stamps the default using different communities you would need
    to add configuration to the PEs to prefer on default over the other. Or am I missing
    something.<br /><br />Probably the easiest way to achieve independence from the
    PEs would be to set up your own (customer) mesh of LSPs using the carrier&#39;s
    underlying MPLS network and avoid the PE&#39;s decision. Something like RSVP-TE
    over L3VPN over MPLS. I never tried anything like that so it&#39;s just a thought
    (just made a quick search on google and looks like someone is already proposing
    this over IETF...)

  html: Whatever attribute attached to the VPNv4 BGP route would work as long as it&#39;s
    recognizable by the route maps use for inbound BGP filters on the PE-router.<br
    /><br />&quot;PE default based on CE signals&quot; - interesting concept. Would
    need some serious EEM hacking to make it work; probably not worth it.

  html: '#1 - You&#39;re absolutely correct. The IP forwarding decision is made by
    the PE-router - as soon as the CE sends an IP packet to the PE, it has no influence
    on its forwarding any more. The default route selection must be made by the PE-router.<br
    /><br />#2 - You don&#39;t need TE. Carrier&#39;s Carrier architecture would work
    just fine.'

  html: I have a &quot;similar&quot; scenario, but do not have control of the configs
    on the PE... I have default route originating in multiple places, I want to control
    which one is preferred and choose one of the others as a secondary.  I am trying
    to &quot;steer&quot; it with as-path depth but it seems that only one default
    route will be taken in regardless of length.  This does not seem to be the same
    behavior displayed by other &quot;non default&quot; routes.  Can&#39;t believe
    I&#39;m the only one doing this, there must be a guide somewhere to help me fix
    this?

  html: Never mind... I think I found my answer.  I need the provider to reconfigure
    the PE&#39;s as you explain above, no other way that I can see.  Hopefully AT&amp;T
    will play nice.  :-D

  html: 'Could you show how you set could and would recommend setting the additional
    route target extcommunity on the datacenter PE routers?<br /><br />for example:  Is
    this being done on the data center PEs by:<br /> - route-map of some kind?<br
    /> - just adding an additional export &lt;additional:rt_value&gt; which is then
    matched in route-map on the PE routers which the remote offices are attached to?<br
    /><br /><br />In a similar problem, suppose you have not preferred, but conflicted
    routes such that in one acquisition integration, 192.168.1.0/24 is used for service
    A in Region A, while in a different, since integrated, acquisition company, 192.168.1.0/24
    is used for service B in Region B.  Suppose there is not alot of appetite for
    solutions to resolve using  re-IP, and suppose you must make the routes for things
    in Region A which conflict with Region B available in their respective regions,
    but not in other...<br /><br />It seems like adding a RT value to the exported
    routes could be used as a marker (tag, community) to then be used in a route-map
    in the other regions to mark the know conflicted routes and prevent their import
    in the other regions where the conflict occurs...<br /><br />What do you think?<br
    /><br />Sam &lt;/additional:rt_value&gt;'

  html: You can either use an additional export RT or an export-map. You&#39;ll find
    more details in my &quot;MPLS and VPN Architectures&quot; book. As for specific
    design problems, I&#39;m always available for consulting engagements, as is our
    Professional Services team.

  html: Hi Jeffrey,<br /> <br />   Correct. The only way for you to be able to select
    which default route will be accepted is through the SP (in your case AT&amp;T).
    Typically you can just ask you&#39;re account team with AT&amp;T that this kind
    of scenario is what you would like to happen. I often dealt this often with AT&amp;T
    <br />     ;)

  html: 'Hi All,<br /><br />Please can anyone explain to me regarding the common service
    : when do we use Fusion router/Firewall and when can we use a shared VRF ?<br
    /><br />I have seen some design when there is a common service like Datacenter
    or Internet and there was a Fusion Firewall (with ebgp) ? I would say that it&#39;s
    easiest to use a common export/import VRF ?'
