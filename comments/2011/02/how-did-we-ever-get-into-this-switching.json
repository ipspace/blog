      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I agree that forwarding packets based on l3 should be called routing. Why whould that change just because the hardware changes, it doesn&#39;t matter if an ASIC or a CPU is doing the forwarding, it&#39;s still routing. The term layer 3 switcing is probably invented to show that there is a difference between a conventional router and a switch doing routing and that switching the packets must be much faster than routing them! On this note I found it interesting when I was doing a lab on frame-relay (preparing for CCIE) and the debug command is called debug frame-relay packet, since when is frame-relay a packet technology? :)",

I can distinctly remember sitting in Cisco presentations being told of the wonders &#39;Layer3 Switching&#39; and feeling deeply troubled.  I had urges to stand up and tell them... &#39;this is routing, not switching&#39;.... I looked around to see if anyone else felt the same, but everyone else was sat there, open mouthed, slightly dribbling, mumbling like Homer Simpson....&quot;I want a layer3 switch&quot;.... There job was done, more confusion followed and Cisco&#39;s share price jumped again.<br />l",

Remember the days of Frames and x.25 when transistors literally switched in a regular interval, whether or not data packets were queued or not.  It&#39;s an old TDM term, likely ~80 years old- and is why it&#39;s most prevalent on legacy voice environments and since been applied to virtualized software based switching technologies.",

A lot of IT people fall into the profession, and much of our knowledge is built on direct exposure, either through scraping our knuckles on our networks, researching technologies / problems and studying for certifications. One thing that is missing is the historical knowledge of the people that preceded us. As I was reading this article, it occurred to me that our industry has been around long enough that the problems and their solution methods are becoming cyclical, everything old is new again. I very much enjoy learning how the problems I run into now, have been solved (for better and for worse) in the past and having a historical understanding of what works and what doesn&#39;t (and why). It is akin to other fields where they teach a historical component so each generation doesn&#39;t reinvent the wheel. Are there texts or other sources to gain a solid understanding of networking&#39;s past successes and failures?",

      "html": "Often I see people struggling to define the difference between the processes of routing and bridging. The key to me is that routing is the process of finding a path between two nodes in a graph. Here graph is a collection of nodes and links and path is ordered sequence of nodes to be traversed to reach the destination. Bridging, on contrast, is simply stitching or joining two links in one, i.e. changing connectivity property in the graph. This is why it is so hard to compare the two processes directly - they apply to different entities. <br /><br />Of course, for the purpose of advanced bridging, a link could be viewed as having complex structure, which, in turn, implements path determination and routing on its own. But I believe that understanding how this two processes apply to different entities is helpful.",
