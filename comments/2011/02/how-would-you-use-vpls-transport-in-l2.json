      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I&#39;m looking to do something very similar right now. One solution that I&#39;ve found is to run VRRP over VPLS. You can short circuit the CE and PE functionality by tying the CE interface back into the PE / VPLS interface. That way you have a routable IP interface / sub-interface that will communicate VRRP over the VPLS.<br /><br />I was able to set this up with Brocade gear in a lab and it&#39;s working really well. Right now I have it working with LDP, but am hoping to utilize FRR over RSVP next week.<br /><br />-Mike",

My SP rep says they can&#39;t deliver but they can deliver a L2 interface to my router on their CIU which is connected to their PE via VPLS, which is connected to the far end PE over L3VPN. This they call Metro Ethernet.<br /><br />So really all I wanted was my partners to connect to my central server cluster and have their traffic segregated from each other. But instead of solution I get sold acronyms?<br /><br />Thanks for all the information, I find your posts very informative.",

You can do this with ES modules but you need them on both sides of the PE. It looks a bit crazy when you start adding resilience with EEM etc, but this is certainly possible for multipoint VPLS.<br /><br />If you want point-to-point as in your diagram (2 DCs) then really you want to look at MLAG with pseudowires, as you said Ivan. The world is a lot simpler then. A question for you on the flip-side; If MC-LAG is the only option and you need multipoint (3 DCs)... are you restricted to controlling the network with inter-site STP?.... eurgh, that&#39;s somewhere I /never/ want to go.",
