    html: Perhaps an SSL VPN router attached to the MRI machine would accomplish this.
      But that would require some renumbering wizardry and other changes.

  html: I worked with a moderate-sized hospital that was using LAM as of about 18
    months ago to deal with medical modailty machines (portable MRI and ultrasound
    equipment, etc) that would move between multiple wings of the building. The machines
    had static IPs and were more-or-less &quot;unchangeable.&quot; According to the
    manufacturer changing the IP address was a major operation, and would invalidate
    all earlier studies by disassociating the machine with its prior studies in the
    database.<br /><br />LAM was used to deal with this, apparently on advice from
    Cisco TAC. I found it to be buggy though. One thing we encountered multiple times
    was that the router would occasionally do an ARP check to validate that the LAM&#39;d
    device was still on the segment, and use that to persist the injected /32 route.
    Problem was, a well-meaning but poorly-configured L3 switch interface on the same
    segment would respond to the ARP with the proxy ARP feature and &quot;refresh&quot;
    the entry on the router. So the router would draw traffic for that device toward
    it even when the device had moved back to it&#39;s &quot;real&quot; subnet. The
    router didn&#39;t seem to track or notice a change in the MAC associated with
    that mis-located IP.<br /><br />But as usual, this network-layer kludgery &quot;fixed&quot;
    an abhorrent application design...

  html: I wrote a white paper back in October 2004 on how we used LAM in two instances;
    one like Bob mentioned above for a hospital while we migrated the network (so
    it was used temporarily then removed) and once to migrate a data center - again
    as a temp feature, but worked perfectly.

  html: For history buffs, some of the same folks behind LAM went on to help with
    &quot;LISP extended subnet mode multihop mobility.&quot; This feature also creates
    host routes in the DC closest to where a mobile host currently is, but it (a)
    works with stretched subnets/L2, and (b) supports live migration. Despite &quot;LISP&quot;
    in its name, its configured only on the default gateways; there&#39;s no need
    for full LISP (xTR&#39;s, encapsulation, etc).  It&#39;s supported on Nexus 7000
    and IOS-XE routers like the ASR 1000 and CSR 1000v.<br /><br />It&#39;s 2018,
    and I still use LAM (and LAM-inspired static host routes) to help with migrations.
