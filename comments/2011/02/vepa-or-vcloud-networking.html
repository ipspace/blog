            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />You may have answered the question I&#39;m about to ask somewhere else, but I certainly have missed your answer, so here comes: could you describe the context of your posts in relation to the Data Centre networking, i.e. what kind of a &quot;cloudy&quot; arrangement would supposedly live in the DCs are you talking about? <br /><br />Some examples of such &quot;cloudy&quot; arrangements might be: a) An enterprise who rents space or owns a DC and runs their own stuff there (and runs private lines to/between DC(s)); b) an XaaS Service Provider, who provides &quot;public&quot; cloudy services (accessed via the Internet); or c) an XaaS Service Provider, who provides &quot;private&quot; cloudy services (accessed via private lines)?<br /><br />The reason I&#39;m asking is that there are differences, sometimes significant, in what might and what might not a problem (or how severe it is), depending on the scenario. For example, for the case (a) a limit of 4094 VLANs is not likely to be a limitation (which is a force at play when you&#39;re using Nexus, AFAIK), but for an SP with hundreds or thousands of customers it would certainly be.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">More to the above - depending on the scenario, the oft-mentioned &quot;tromboning&quot; problem may not be a problem at all - if storage is replicated (sync or via storage vMotion), and a VM after the move is talking to storage at the new location, then, assuming we&#39;re talking typical enterprise applications (CRM, ERP) the volumes of data exchanged between DB server and application clients usually are quite minuscule, so tromboning might not be such a big issue?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The tools to build scalable data centers are already out there with true distributed processing frameworks like Hadoop, Cassandra, MapReduce, etc. Google, Facebook and Amazon have done this successfully and have scaled their systems without extended vlans all over the globe. Granted, they choose to hire the best and the brightest engineers but shouldn&#39;t any large organization attempting such a lofty goal as the almighty &quot;Cloud&quot; do the same? <br /><br />Most organizations are going about things backwards (probably because consolidation was marketed before &quot;the cloud&quot;). If you implement a true distributed computing platform, you improve server consolidation. VMware solves a consolidation problem, not a distributed computing problem. If organizations want a true cloud, the answer is to invest in engineering talent, not an off the shelf product.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">It depends on how well you design your network and what the traffic flows are. Inbound traffic will always trombone (unless you use interesting tricks with Route Health Injection that brings you close to L3 solution), database traffic will also trombone, outbound traffic might go through the nearest exit point and out into the WAN, but then you can&#39;t use any stateful device in the path (Roland Dobbins would undoubtedly say &quot;I told you firewalls stink&quot;)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Have you heard of the Open vSwitch?  They basically establish tunnels to the edge, so the physical network just does packet forwarding and all service provisioning occurs in the logical network.  It sounded a little nuts to me at first, but the more I read and think about it, the more compelling it sounds.<br /><br />http://openvswitch.org/</div>
