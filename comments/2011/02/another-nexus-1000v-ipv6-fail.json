      "html": "Fail for sure especially because there are a number of enterprises/governments that have been putting IPv6 support as a mandatory requirement. But also, like you mentioned, we have multiple vendors in the market so I&#39;m sure we can skip Cisco if we want so it&#39;s not the end of the road.<br /><br />But what I think it&#39;s happening is that even VSphere IPv6 support is not at the same level as IPv4 (but getting there) so Cisco might be thinking: - the market is not going to migrate from IPv4 to IPv6 tomorrow, maybe not even during next 12 months...  slowly  they&#39;ll introduce it but the biggest market share will still cover IPv4 scenarios so we have one, maybe two, years in front of us to come up with a new Nexus xxxxV product line.<br /><br />Or maybe I&#39;m wrong and they just don&#39;t care!",

And in general the audience was very aware of this, because for products that do not have IPv6 capability there were always some people asking &quot;ok, but what about IPv6&quot;, in every session that I attended.<br />(And it seems that the ace team is going to do something about this as well... even though they are &quot;a bit&quot; behind...)<br />And wireless network at Live was ipv4/ipv6, so we had native ipv6 internet connectivity.",
