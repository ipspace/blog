  html: Since this is glaring, could it be an issue with the specific IOS you are
    using? Perhaps a bug or a regression of sorts? I have no actual evidence to support
    this, it was just an initial thought that came to mind.

  html: The string match command does pattern matching. Instead of reading Cisco web
    site you just need Tcl manual page for string command. Your test cases are all
    wrong (at least regarding pattern syntax). There are proper tests:<br /><br />%
    string match &quot;a*&quot; &quot;aba&quot;<br />1<br />% string match &quot;a*b?z&quot;
    &quot;aeb1z&quot;<br />1<br />% string match &quot;a*b?z&quot; &quot;aeb1zz&quot;<br
    />0

  html: 'agreed with Oleg.<br /><br />Here is description:<br /><br />string match
    pattern string <br />See if pattern matches string; return 1 if it does, 0 if
    it doesn&#39;t. Matching is done in a fashion similar to that used by the C-shell.
    For the two strings to match, their contents must be identical except that the
    following special sequences may appear in pattern: <br /><br />* <br />Matches
    any sequence of characters in string, including a null string. <br /><br />? <br
    />Matches any single character in string. <br /><br />[chars] <br />Matches any
    character in the set given by chars. If a sequence of the form x-y appears in
    chars, then any character between x and y, inclusive, will match. <br /><br />\x
    <br />Matches the single character x. This provides a way of avoiding the special
    interpretation of the characters *?[]\ in pattern.'
