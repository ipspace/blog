You need to redistribute in a policy from one protocol to the other, no &#39;redistribute&#39; commands or &#39;network&#39; statements.  That much of it I kind of like.</p>\n\n<p>Juniper has a default deny though.  Unless you explicitly export &quot;from protocol OSPF&quot; to BGP then it doesn&#39;t happen.  I think that&#39;s better tbh, but I guess it just means on SRL you need to make sure to have sensible policies everywhere.</p>\n",

I think that SR Linux is just using a different presentation of the RIB when you use &quot;show protocols bgp route&quot; to display attributes relevant to BGP.</p>\n",
