            <div class="comment-content"><p>RRs usually do a best path selection by default. The RR clients will not see directly the alternate paths of a redundant topology. In case of a failover, they have to wait for a new best path selection and update from the RR.
So if there are no special constraints, then it is better to forward all additional paths to the RR clients, so they can select an alternate path locally without waiting for the RR to give a new hint.
Failover performance might improve for the price of more memory resources used. </p>
