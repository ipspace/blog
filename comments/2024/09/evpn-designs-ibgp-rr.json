In case of a failover, they have to wait for a new best path selection and update from the RR.\nSo if there are no special constraints, then it is better to forward all additional paths to the RR clients, so they can select an alternate path locally without waiting for the RR to give a new hint.\nFailover performance might improve for the price of more memory resources used. </p>\n",
