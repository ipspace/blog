And if the feature is supported, then forget about temporary addresses and configure a persistent &ldquo;private&rdquo; address instead. Meaning, each host will use only one /128 for its lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m a strong advocate for BCOP-690 (yes I know it&#39;s SP-oriented) and do not believe in this crap about &ldquo;Privacy extension rotation or dynamic IPs will magically stop big bro from tracking you&rdquo; &mdash; No, I personally use analytics tools and no, dynamic IPs doesn&#39;t stop tracking in any shape or form. This is a tinfoil conspiracy theory that tracking is dropped dead on dynamic IPs that seems popular in EU for some reason and parts of Asia (where I am based in).</p>\n\n<p>So, in addition to BCOP-690, I explicitly configured pref-lifetime and valid-lifetime to infinity on the upstream router. I don&#39;t believe in &ldquo;dynamic IPs&rdquo; for anything in IPv6 world.</p>\n",
