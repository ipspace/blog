Never ran into bugs that were unique to eBGP driven networks. Whatever bugs that we ran into, can be replicated independent of this design.</p>\n\n<p>However, I would caution the readers, that at my ex, and in my current roles and consulting work, we/I <em>never</em> built networks that followed RFC7938 (DC or SP, both) to the letter &mdash; The idea of NO IGPs/iBGP, is something I don&#39;t agree with, as it will just complicate your route filters configuration, once BGP multipathing (ECMP or UCMP) is at play etc at a large enough scale.</p>\n\n<p>I do have intentions about blogging out an article on eBGP driven SP networks [again keep in mind, I very much have MPLS, IGP, iBGP etc just no full-mesh, and no route-reflectors (yet anyway)] in the future, using a real-life examples.</p>\n",
