               "html": "<p>I was about to comment on bufferbloat. I&#39;ve interacted with Dave T&auml;ht plenty of times on this topic, and he&#39;s IMO the go-to expert on queuing discipline and packet buffering.</p>\n\n<p>LibreQoS is a good middle-box solution for poorly designed networks and/or poor network equipment vendor (aka all the current vendors, none of them support FQ_Codel on hardware). We&#39;ve even joked about this a few times:\nhttps://x.com/DaryllSwer/status/1753146680659308708</p>\n\n<p>In the case of the latter, if every network vendor listened to Dave T&auml;ht and implemented FQ_Codel on the ASICs directly and from there, allow the operator to configure bandwidth caps (queues/policer) using FQ_Codel, most of the bufferbloat bs goes away.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s even worse for Wi-Fi, LTE/5G equipment, the vendors refuse to adopt something like cake-autorate or just plain fq_codel with BQL. Starlink a few months ago did share their &ldquo;new&rdquo; router is FQ_Codel enabled and offloaded straight, they did publish some data I believe that showed excessively LOW latency with FQ_Codel enabled.</p>\n\n<p>Dave introduced me to FQ_Codel a few years ago, since then I&#39;ve deployed FQ_Codel for many ISPs that use MikroTik (which has FQ_Codel, but no BQL support) and bufferbloat/latency at peak has significantly dropped.</p>\n\n<p>I agree with this blog post&#39;s general opinion as well. I don&#39;t understand this bs about &ldquo;app based&rdquo; anything. No, it should be port-based or customer VLAN based at most.</p>\n\n<p>100% in favour of keeping SP networks as clean transit paths instead of packet molestation and mangling along the way - We&#39;re already doing that due to governmental pressures for internet censorship/blocking etc.</p>\n",
