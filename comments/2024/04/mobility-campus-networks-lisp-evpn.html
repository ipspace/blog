            <div class="comment-content"><p>&gt;&gt;There might be a reason only a single business unit of a single vendor uses LISP in their fabric solution
&gt;&gt;(hint: regardless of what the whitepapers say, it has little to do with technology).</p>

<p>... and even that vendor realized that it&#39;s time to move on and are now officially supporting EVPN for their fabric (and is praising themselves for the wonderful interoperability options they get with EVPN, see f.e. BRKENS-2092 &amp; BRKENS-2050 from CL Amsterdam 2024).
So if you ask me: LISP was &amp; is terminal, now on life-support, will be dead soon...</p>

<p>Will be interesting to see how the migration path for existing deployments will look like, if there will be one...</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Ivan
thanks for nice article on the topic. At https://ibb.co/6JDr03D there is graph of all lisp fabric roaming delays attached. Number of roaming users is not easily calculable (DNAC has no such feature yet :0). Population of wireless endpoints is ~2.1K  </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>There is one critical point. You assume anchored mobility for option one. This is unacceptable for safety critical networks. You should have mobility without an anchor point. Exactly that is what LISP provides for you. A fully distributed data plane without any single point of failure. The control plane is centralized logically, but could be fully distributed, even geo-redundant physically. 
You might say that single point of failures are not an issue in most networks. But in other networks this might be not acceptable. </p>

<p>For option two, with BGP you cannot reach the same speed of mobility and scale, because of the complex BGP path selection algorithm. On the same CPU LISP will be always much faster. Cisco once did an in-house race on this issue. LISP was the clear winner against the best BGP experts available inside Cisco. 
BTW, Boeing Connexion failed miserably many years ago with BGP based mobility. </p>

<p>If mobility is not an issue, you might be happy with option one, then EVPN might be good enough. If you need distributed anchorless mobility, than LISP will be always better by architecture. </p>

<p>LISP is especially a good fit for parallel active multilink mobility using Priority and Weight. PMIPv6 cannot do the same. BGP also does not have anything standardized for such scenarios. 
Few networks would need that today, but probably in the future all moving vehicles will have higher safety and security requirements. Then LISP is an easy natural solution. While all other protocols has to be redefined and implemented new. Even 3GPP does not have a comparable mobility solution yet.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I know you work in environments that are very far away (requirements-wise) from &quot;typical&quot; networks, so it&#39;s always great to have your perspective. Thanks a million!</p>

<p>As for the &quot;complex BGP path selection algorithm,&quot; that&#39;s definitely true, but in a typical (sane) EVPN scenario, all path attributes should match, and thus, the actual code path should be relatively simple.</p>

<p>I am positive nobody ever optimized BGP for the speed of simple path selection, but then we also didn&#39;t have JavaScript JIT compilers until people started running JS on the servers. This discussion somewhat reminds me of the famous IS-IS versus OSPF wars, where it turned out that one of the main reasons for sub-par OSPF performance on Cisco IOS (so the rumors go) was that the team writing the IS-IS code was better (because they had to deal with larger customers).</p>

<p>Anyway, it turns out that we usually &quot;solve&quot; problems with brute-force application of more resources, and as long as the ASIC FIB programming remains the bottleneck, it doesn&#39;t matter (in the data center/campus switching space) too much how much faster LISP is... or am I missing something?</p>
