            <div class="comment-content"><p>&gt;&gt;There might be a reason only a single business unit of a single vendor uses LISP in their fabric solution
&gt;&gt;(hint: regardless of what the whitepapers say, it has little to do with technology).</p>

<p>... and even that vendor realized that it&#39;s time to move on and are now officially supporting EVPN for their fabric (and is praising themselves for the wonderful interoperability options they get with EVPN, see f.e. BRKENS-2092 &amp; BRKENS-2050 from CL Amsterdam 2024).
So if you ask me: LISP was &amp; is terminal, now on life-support, will be dead soon...</p>

<p>Will be interesting to see how the migration path for existing deployments will look like, if there will be one...</p>
