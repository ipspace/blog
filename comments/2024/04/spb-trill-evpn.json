STP wasn&#39;t enough, came SPB and TRILL, wasn&#39;t enough, came VXLAN/EVPN <em>sigh</em>, next up, Ethernet over HTTPS Port 443 &mdash; half-joking, but probably will become reality as the industry is moving everything to port 443 like SSH3 now.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m currently trying to push IPv6-native-layer-3-only approach for Docker/Swarm at least:\nhttps://github.com/docker/docs/issues/19556</p>\n\n<p>K8s apparently has some eBPF based &quot;DSR&quot; and similar that removes the need for layer 2 adjacency (VXLAN/EVPN encap) - However, it is to be noted I&#39;m no expert on K8s. You can find some info on this on that Docker issue, other users talked about it.</p>\n",
