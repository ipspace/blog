We had a problem that a hosting provider enabled full IPv6 hosting for an SMB client of ours. Essentially free of charge. A fully working one too boot.</p>\n\n<p>Very fast the client got bombarded by customer complains of &quot;horrible performance&quot;. Some customers had computers by default configured to preffer IPv6 name resolution for some reason and those got horrible performance seemingly at random. Once AAAA was rolled back, issues disappeared. Eventually, this was nailed down to customer being on an IPv4-only networks with IDPS/proxying deployed so tunnelling was triggered, did not work, and a retry using IPv4 took a lot of time to happen as the IPv6 packets were just behing blackholed probably.</p>\n\n<p>Now, nothing was wrong with the web of the client, of with the DNS config. It was just a common case of their customer systems not complying with standards ... of course the SMB vendor was blamed for &quot;broken system&quot; and very fast instituted a policy of &quot;no-public-facing-IPv6-over-here&quot; right from the CEO level. And I have to admint correctly so. That was 2022. Ahem.</p>\n\n<p>Not suprise the main online outlets avoid it.</p>\n",
