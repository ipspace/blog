            <div class="comment-content"><p>World&#39;s by far not taht simple especially if sessions can be asymmetric ;-) HA in such scenario is extremely hard to build, especially since it&#39;s not a 2 controller through backplane scenario but &quot;arbitrary distrance, arbitrary delay, may be just a piece of wet string&quot; ;-) For two boxes working solutions from reputable vendors are available since long time, more than two leads into weird stuff like Paxos quickly.  There are other, clever ways to deal with HA and asymmetry as well you may want to dig in as well ;-) </p>
