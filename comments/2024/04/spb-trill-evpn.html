<p>What? There are people doing that? I wasn&#39;t even aware nor seen that before, crazy.</p>

<p>BTW, I found the EBGP-over-EBGP approach too abhorrent to describe it.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>All of this nonsense complexity wouldn&#39;t exist if we just stopped spanning and stretching Ethernet and instead either develop a successor to Ethernet, or move to layer 3-only hardware + networking. STP wasn&#39;t enough, came SPB and TRILL, wasn&#39;t enough, came VXLAN/EVPN <em>sigh</em>, next up, Ethernet over HTTPS Port 443 &mdash; half-joking, but probably will become reality as the industry is moving everything to port 443 like SSH3 now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m currently trying to push IPv6-native-layer-3-only approach for Docker/Swarm at least:
https://github.com/docker/docs/issues/19556</p>

<p>K8s apparently has some eBPF based &quot;DSR&quot; and similar that removes the need for layer 2 adjacency (VXLAN/EVPN encap) - However, it is to be noted I&#39;m no expert on K8s. You can find some info on this on that Docker issue, other users talked about it.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>SPB/TRILL were (are?) both great ideas that should have seen more market acceptance. Simple, reliable, scalable. What&#39;s not to like?</p>

<p>So why did the industry buck those technologies and pivot to VXLAN and EVPN?  I blame software. The SDN movement has only ever wanted IP connectivity (&quot;We&#39;ll take it from here&quot; was their mantra). They had painfully little interest in layer-2 design, efficiency be damned. </p>

<p>The hardware folks could have doubled-down on L2, as Avaya did. But many saw existential risk, as if a few Stanford Linux nerds would somehow make hardware irrelevant (or commodity). So, faster than you can say &quot;openflow&quot;, the HW companies embraced IP overlays, imagining a world of HW and SW VTEPs passing packets around while humming kumbaya.   (to date, HW/SW overlay integration is extremely rare)</p>

<p>Who cares if the configuration is complex and individualized? Why aren&#39;t you using a controller or automation?
Who cares if MTU blows up? That&#39;s a software problem.
Who cares if TCP offloads fail. That&#39;s a NIC problem.
Who cares if traffic flow is incomprehensible complex with the rabbit hole of nested overlays, distributed gateways, and multiple routing tiers? That&#39;s job security.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I completely agree, Craig. The analysis of SPBm is a bit ridiculous and over the top. It has not taken hold as much as one would expect, in the market mostly because a series of completely untechnical catastrophies with Bay-Nortel-Avaya, and Alcatel Lucent. The other vendors failed miserably with Trill implementations (Anyone use Fabricpath or Q-Fabric)? yet they did not have the organizational disasters Nortel/Avaya and Alcatel had so they weathered the storm and are not on to even more ridiculously complex huge datacenter square peg into large campus round hole architectures based on EVPN or LISP with IP overlays and servers for automation solutions. LISP is dying out to, why? because no one actually has the intellectual stamina to figure the nightmare out and use it on a large environment.</p>

<p>SPBm is an extremely elegant solution, and if it wasn&#39;t for large HW manufactures and their partner ecosystems making a lot of money from servicing complexity, combined with the non-technical corporate events mentioned above, it would be all over the place. As is, there are about 1/10th as many layer 3 fabrics deployed into actual campus networks than there are SPBm fabrics, even with the headwinds mentioned.</p>
