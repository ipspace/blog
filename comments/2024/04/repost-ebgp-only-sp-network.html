            <div class="comment-content"><p>At my ex, AS48635, we ran a 100% eBGP driven production DC network (also happens to be SP-like), spanning multiple DCs and countries (although different public downstream ASNs) in Europe. eBGP never failed us, especially with the granularity of eBGP route filters that it provides for TE/Path manipulation, BGP communities etc.</p>

<p>We used Juniper gear for 99% of things, some Aristas, and Cisco units in some legacy network segments (eventually swapped for Juniper) and a lot of Cumulus white boxes and also Ubuntu/RHEL based distros with eBGP using FRR. Never ran into bugs that were unique to eBGP driven networks. Whatever bugs that we ran into, can be replicated independent of this design.</p>

<p>However, I would caution the readers, that at my ex, and in my current roles and consulting work, we/I <em>never</em> built networks that followed RFC7938 (DC or SP, both) to the letter &mdash; The idea of NO IGPs/iBGP, is something I don&#39;t agree with, as it will just complicate your route filters configuration, once BGP multipathing (ECMP or UCMP) is at play etc at a large enough scale.</p>

<p>I do have intentions about blogging out an article on eBGP driven SP networks [again keep in mind, I very much have MPLS, IGP, iBGP etc just no full-mesh, and no route-reflectors (yet anyway)] in the future, using a real-life examples.</p>
