            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Ivan, 
we did a few projects using this method and it works absolutly great and you can use mostly the same configlets in CVP for all switches, that makes it really handy. 
For the command &quot;&zwnj;ip routing ipv6 interfaces&quot;; I learned it during testing for the first project where we used this and its basically a switch to allow routing through your box with IPv4 over IPv6 interfaces. Without that command, we could send data from a leaf to the spine. But the spine did just nothing, it was a blackhole. Only with that command the forwarding would work and then everything was fine. </p>
