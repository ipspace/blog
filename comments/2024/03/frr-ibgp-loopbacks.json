The multi-agent model will always advertise the BGP-RIB winner, even if it is not the RIB winner (i.e. bgp advertise-inactive is implicitly enabled in multi-agent model and can&#39;t be disabled). You can still configure it but &quot;show bgp configuration unsupported&quot; will flag it. </p>\n",

In order to preserve forwarding consistency within the network routers should not advertise the routes that cannot be used locally for forwarding (by default).</p>\n",
