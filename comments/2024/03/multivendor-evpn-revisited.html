            <div class="comment-content"><p>Rant is mentioned in the title, so let&#39;s fuel it a bit ;)</p>

<p>&quot;crazy ideas of running IBGP over EBGP&quot; allow you to achieve exactly what was mentioned in the first question - EVPN-VXLAN fabric with spines doing only plain IPv4 forwarding with eBGP signaling.</p>

<p>I doubt you can find more interoperable protocol than eBGP AFI/SAFI 1/1. Definitely better than OSPF in this aspect. Try to change my mind ;)</p>

<p>I personally saw networks built using one vendor for TORs and 2 different vendors for spines, and this design makes a lot of sense for many reasons.</p>

<p>As long as you don&#39;t run BGP RR on the spines ;) For whatever crazy reason, most vendors promoting this design forget about this tiny little detail ;))</p>

<p>Trying to change ingrained beliefs is futile. Let&#39;s just say that most of the Internet runs on OSPF/IS-IS + IBGP/EBGP, and it mostly works.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Average company is blessed beyond their wildest dreams to find an engineer who understands what a BPDU is and that bridging loops are bad.  L2oL3, MP-BGP AFIs, ESIs, VTEPs....not supportable by 99% of the wild.  All just pushing the needle on sales.  4k VLAN limit isn&#39;t a valid argument in the 99% either.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>OSPF was brand new at that time and (according to some rumors) wasn&#39;t implemented optimally on some platforms. The fact that it was overspecified and that Cisco kept pushing its own routing algorithm (IGRP, later EIGRP) didn&#39;t help either.</p>

<p>Anyway, getting OSPF to work reliably across three major vendors at that time was a bit of a challenge, not to mention four versions of OSPFv2 (1247, 1583, 2178, 2328) and stuff that kept appearing, like NSSA and demand circuits.</p>

<p>FWIW, Nexus OS has (had?) the &quot;rfc1583compatibility&quot; nerd knob, and RFC 1583 was published in March 1994 (= exactly 30 years ago).</p>
