            <div class="comment-content"><p>Rant is mentioned in the title, so let&#39;s fuel it a bit ;)</p>

<p>&quot;crazy ideas of running IBGP over EBGP&quot; allow you to achieve exactly what was mentioned in the first question - EVPN-VXLAN fabric with spines doing only plain IPv4 forwarding with eBGP signaling.</p>

<p>I doubt you can find more interoperable protocol than eBGP AFI/SAFI 1/1. Definitely better than OSPF in this aspect. Try to change my mind ;)</p>

<p>I personally saw networks built using one vendor for TORs and 2 different vendors for spines, and this design makes a lot of sense for many reasons.</p>

<p>As long as you don&#39;t run BGP RR on the spines ;) For whatever crazy reason, most vendors promoting this design forget about this tiny little detail ;))</p>

<p>Trying to change ingrained beliefs is futile. Let&#39;s just say that most of the Internet runs on OSPF/IS-IS + IBGP/EBGP, and it mostly works.</p>

<p>... at scale.</p>
