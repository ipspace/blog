<p>GEANT.org has one CsC VPN active: the MD-VPN (Multi-Domain). There might be a second one together with ESNET for &quot;LHCONE&quot;.</p>

<p>I like that CsC idea especially when JunOS offers VPNs type &quot;mpls-forwarding&quot; for validation of labels against advertised routes via BGP-LU (sort of RPF checking). But I guess most networking people don&#39;t know how to perform Inter-AS MPLS and are better off with SD-WAN devices especially once managers / sales people become because it&#39;s &quot;next gen&quot;..</p>

<p>Per-prefix labeling for an Internet-in-VRF is impossible these days as the MPLS label space only allows for 1M prefixes and Internet for both IPv4 + IPv6 together exceeds that. Probably IPv4 next year exceeds that by itself if it hasn&#39;t already.</p>
