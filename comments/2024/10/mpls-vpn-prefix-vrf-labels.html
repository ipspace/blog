            <div class="comment-content"><p>&gt; Carrier&rsquo;s Carrier architecture (is anyone using that?)</p>

<p>GEANT.org has one CsC VPN active: the MD-VPN (Multi-Domain). There might be a second one together with ESNET for &quot;LHCONE&quot;.</p>

<p>I like that CsC idea especially when JunOS offers VPNs type &quot;mpls-forwarding&quot; for validation of labels against advertised routes via BGP-LU (sort of RPF checking). But I guess most networking people don&#39;t know how to perform Inter-AS MPLS and are better off with SD-WAN devices especially once managers / sales people become because it&#39;s &quot;next gen&quot;..</p>

<p>Per-prefix labeling for an Internet-in-VRF is impossible these days as the MPLS label space only allows for 1M prefixes and Internet for both IPv4 + IPv6 together exceeds that. Probably IPv4 next year exceeds that by itself if it hasn&#39;t already.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>This is a fantastic post! I love how you blend humor with technical details, making a complex topic like MPLS/VPN label allocation both engaging and easy to understand. The explanation of per-prefix vs. per-VRF labels is spot on, and the real-world examples really help clarify when each approach is useful. Your insights into EVPN, VXLAN, and the hardware challenges behind MPLS labels are also incredibly valuable. Overall, this is a great resource for anyone trying to get a better grasp on these networking concepts. Well done!</p>
