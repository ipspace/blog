            <div class="comment-content"><p>Why would IP be the &quot;winner&quot; for finding adjacent nodes?</p>

<p>To send traffic, both IP and CLNP build a &quot;kind of&quot; ARP table (let&#39;s say &quot;neighbor&quot; table).
IP needs to check network mask before looking at this &quot;neighbor&quot; table.
CLNP can use it directly =&gt; looks better to me.</p>

<p>But what if there are a LOT of nodes in a segment?
IP doesn&#39;t need to keep track of nodes it doesn&#39;t communicate with =&gt; can a good point
Must CLNP keep track of every nodes? Can it send ES-ES requests like ARP?</p>
