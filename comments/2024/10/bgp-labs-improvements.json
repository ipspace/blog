But since I switched jobs, it was really difficult to practice and keep up with networking and I was desperately looking for something preferably opensource to get started with along with a directed approach. These labs really are a blessing in an industry where most of the information is hidden behind paywalls. It had taken me some time to setup the labs, but once that barrier was crossed it was such a smooth experience where I could focus on the topics at hand and seldom worried about the underlying infra. I really hope the labs continue even though I might have a lot of catching up to do.\nThanks for doing what you do, Ivan :)</p>\n",
