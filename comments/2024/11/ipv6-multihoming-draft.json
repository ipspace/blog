ITU-T has much better and cleaner approach to network architecture. G.805 and G.809 should be taught first to all network professionals, not the OSI model or the IETF layered model. </p>\n",

Glad to see it getting some additional attention from someone. I am one of those religious anti-NAT zealots, but also understand using it if it&#39;s the only good solution, I just try to if at all possible find other solutions.

If you use interface tracking to setup the LAN side of your firewall then OpenWRT will automatically deprecate the prefix from the wan that goes down causing all clients to automatically switch to preferring the prefix for the other WAN. Is this feature not common among other firewalls? Is there something I&#39;m not understanding?</p>\n",
