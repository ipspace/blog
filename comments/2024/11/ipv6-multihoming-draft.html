            <div class="comment-content"><p>This is not an IPv4 or IPv6 specific problem. This is based on the missing separation of a locator from an identifier. 
Any scheme that provides such a separation would solve the multi-homing issue. Even mobility would become easy for hosts as well for networks. </p>

<p>This is a very old problem already existing with telephony networks.
Now we have number portability to solve the issue. It is not nice, but in daily use...</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>You have also mentioned it before, that if programmers could use symbolic names and name resolution (e.g., DNS), then this problem could be solved outside of the network layer.
However, the culture evolved differently and now we are forced to solve problems in the network layer, they would be better to be solved in other layers.</p>

<p>That all comes from the over simplifications of early IETF efforts. ITU-T has much better and cleaner approach to network architecture. G.805 and G.809 should be taught first to all network professionals, not the OSI model or the IETF layered model. </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I would go as far as saying that the &quot;evolution of culture&quot; was caused by networking MacGyvers, a total lack of any engineering discipline, and vendors pushing overly complex solutions to create lock-in.</p>
