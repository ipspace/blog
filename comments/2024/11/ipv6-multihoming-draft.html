            <div class="comment-content"><p>This is not an IPv4 or IPv6 specific problem. This is based on the missing separation of a locator from an identifier. 
Any scheme that provides such a separation would solve the multi-homing issue. Even mobility would become easy for hosts as well for networks. </p>
