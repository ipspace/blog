For e.g. Juniper&#39;s Paragon offers a complete view of the changes applied as part of the deployment to each device where the change was applied, and can be undone in a single shot by simply (for the lack of a better word) deleting the deployment. Vaguely remember Cisco NSO supporting rollback too, albeit on a device by device basis. Not sure if there is a vendor neutral solution out there.</p>\n",
