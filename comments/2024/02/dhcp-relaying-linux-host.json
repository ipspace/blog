Now this non-standard behavior you have observed with the ISC DHCP relay (<code>dhcrelay</code>) works around the connectivity problem.</p>\n\n<p>The ISC DHCP Relay <a href=\"https://kb.isc.org/docs/isc-dhcp-44-manual-pages-dhcrelay\">man page</a> seems to suggest that the software is intended as a normal DHCP relay, but its behavior seems to diverge from that of normal DHCP relays.</p>\n",
