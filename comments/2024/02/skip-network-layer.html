            <div class="comment-content"><p>Ivan,
I cut my teeth as a junior PC tech in the early 90s.  My special talent was being able to jockey the config.sys and autoexec.bat on MS-DOS workstations and get all the device drivers to load, plus tweaking the IRQ and Memory locations (with dip switches) on ISA bus ethernet cards. <br />
At the ripe age of 19, I figured I knew everything in the world there was to know about computer networks and continued to deploy LAT with reckless abandon.  </p>

<p>1 year later this new guys shows up who has some experience and explains why I might want to consider deploying TCP/IP rather than LAT.  Bah!  Why would these networks ever want to talk to anything else?   </p>

<p>Oh the hubris of youth...</p>

can we just make John Day&#39;s <em>Patterns in Network Architecture</em> required reading for anyone that enters the field?  </p>

<p>You can agree or disagree with Day&#39;s opinion, but at least he makes you think about the underling issues.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Thinking about the underlying issues is good, and I&#39;m all for having some required reading that would force newcomers to do that.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the vibe I got from his materials (admittedly presentations, not the book) is more like, &quot;They got it all wrong, but I know how to do it right,&quot; and then he goes into applications of RFC 1925 rule 6a (the &quot;R&quot; in RINA). See https://blog.ipspace.net/2022/09/ipv6-worst-decision-ever.html and https://blog.ipspace.net/2022/11/multihoming-within-network.html</p>

<p>Or I&#39;m still missing something important &#x1F937;&zwj;&#x2642;&#xFE0F;</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I can whole-heartedly recommend Day&#39;s book.  There is a lot of history, which you are likely 100% familiar with.</p>

<p>But he does hit the nail on the head on why IPv4 doesn&#39;t do multi-homing correctly and he only uses CLNP as an example where they didn&#39;t screw that (entirely) up.  IPv4 addresses the NIC and CLNP addresses the node.  That&#39;s a huge difference.  </p>

<p>His discourse on layers is great.  Everything is a repeating layer with certain attributes that are required for each layer.  Everything is inter-process communication (IPC) and just the mechanisms change, depending on the scope.  </p>

<p>I especially like his view on what he calls &quot;enrolment&quot;.  We slapped DHCP onto IPv4 and thought that was a solution.  Day explains how enrolment is integral to the layer you are enrolling in because it&#39;s integral to how the topology of your layer works!</p>
