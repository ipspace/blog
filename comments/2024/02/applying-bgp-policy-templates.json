For eBGP session I often find myself to structure neighbors with similar requirements to be part of the same template and use more specific configuration under the neighbor itself such as MD5 and individual route-maps for manipulating the attributes.</p>\n\n<p>In most DC&rsquo;s I am using ECMP to different eBGP neighbors which are part of the same AS.</p>\n\n<p>Back in the days I found out (at least on NX-OS) if a neighbor is configured for inheriting a template and if you be more specific ex configure different MD5 password under the neighbor itself it will take precedence.</p>\n",
