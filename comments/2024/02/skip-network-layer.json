My special talent was being able to jockey the config.sys and autoexec.bat on MS-DOS workstations and get all the device drivers to load, plus tweaking the IRQ and Memory locations (with dip switches) on ISA bus ethernet cards. <br />\nAt the ripe age of 19, I figured I knew everything in the world there was to know about computer networks and continued to deploy LAT with reckless abandon.  </p>\n\n<p>1 year later this new guys shows up who has some experience and explains why I might want to consider deploying TCP/IP rather than LAT.  Bah!  Why would these networks ever want to talk to anything else?   </p>\n\n<p>Oh the hubris of youth...</p>\n",
