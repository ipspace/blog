         "html": "<p>Hi Ivan, great work. </p>\n\n<p>EVPN has come a long way, for unicast services there is now a level of maturity and feature consistency across vendors for the most common deployment models; vlan-based, A-A and symmetric IRB, to ensure successful interop. This is illustrated in the EANTC test reports of the past few years, with the focus now moving to more complex deployment models involving dual-stack, OISM and EVPN GWs. </p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think we should make light of the EANTC work, it&rsquo;s an independent test event which all the major vendors attend, with the sole aim of validating interoperability through compliance to the IETF standards. So the focus is not just making things work but rather ensuring compliance to the relevant standard(s) with the results independently verified.</p>\n\n<p>Happy to discuss further if you have any questions.  </p>\n\n<p>Alex</p>\n",
