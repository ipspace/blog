Where would you expect to find it? Where should I put a link to that information?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n",

Thanks!!</p>\n\n<p>I did have to alias the docker image to match the eos 4.31.2F version the netlab seems to want to start.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, is there a place I can specify, for example, eos 4.32.1F (current)?  Newb question, I know.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks again!!  This was otherwise super easy.</p>\n",
