            <div class="comment-content"><p>Thank you for pointing out that this is still a thing. I learned about those hub/common/services networks during my early days as a network engineer running a MPLS network. Unfortunatly I&#39;ve never seen it anywhere else, despite it being a really cool &quot;trick&quot;. Thaught it a lot of other engineers who where learing about MPLS and BGP and it makes me happy seeing it&#39;s still alive with EVPN. Thank you.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Ivan,</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, for the design you implemented for the centralized firewall, was your VPN label allocation for the HUB VRF done per prefix or per CE allocation?</p>

<p>With per VRF VPN label allocation, the PE hosting the hub VRF would perform an IP lookup after popping the VPN label. Since it has all the routes to the other spokes, traffic between spoke sites would be possible without going through the firewall. Spokes could reach each other via the hub, as they are drawn by the default route.</p>

<p>I had a similar use case for a customer in Arista, where currently only the per VRF label allocation mode is supported. We had to be a bit more creative and ended up using two HUB VRFs: one for traffic coming from the spokes (HUB-IN) and one for traffic going to the spokes (HUB-OUT). The first HUB VRF would only export the default route learned from the firewall in MP-BGP, while the second VRF would only import the spokes&#39; routes.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>@Keanu: IIRC Cisco IOS used pre-prefix allocation as default in those days, so it was a no-brainer.</p>

<p>If one were to use the per-VRF label, then of course, one would have to use ingress and egress hub VRFs (the traditional hub-and-spoke architecture described in a few MPLS books)</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I have designed several data center networks with common service VRFs (monitoring, backup, etc) but with regular MLAG L2 &quot;fabrics&quot; and MPLS routers on the stick. ACI do have a common tenant. I have been thinking of having the same topology with EVPN, so this post is very useful.</p>

<p>However, it seems that the transit VXLAN acts as something similar as a inner VRF label in an MPLS VPN network. Just wondering, maybe VPN hub&amp;spoke topologies with EVPN SR-MPLS would be simpler and better supported by the vendors than EVPN VXLAN, guess that EVPN SR-MPLS is used by the WAN providers....? </p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s effectively per-VRF inner label.</p>

<p>You&#39;d have to talk to vendor PLMs, my vague personal impression from the outside is that everyone is focused on VXLAN in the data center, and that MPLS gets implemented when a big enough customer pushes the vendor to do it (Cisco is an obvious exception because it pushes SRv6).</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks for another very instructive post.</p>

<p>I considered your approach a while ago trying to replace the above discussed common services VRF based on MPLS L3VPN with EVPN. </p>

<p>Challenge is when only a default route is advertised from the common services VRF.
- In MPLS we used per-prefix label allocation; label action on PE for 0.0.0.0/0 happens without route-lookup so label gets popped and traffic sent to the firewall. (desired scenario)
- In EVPN there is no label switching; route lookup for destination happens on hub and traffic is directly sent back to a spoke without traversing the firewall.</p>

<p>So without deploying another layer of complexity with PBR or &quot;IN-VRF&quot; and &quot;OUT-VRF&quot; to redirect traffic to the firewall, how would you solve this in your scenario?</p>
