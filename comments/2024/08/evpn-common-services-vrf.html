            <div class="comment-content"><p>Thank you for pointing out that this is still a thing. I learned about those hub/common/services networks during my early days as a network engineer running a MPLS network. Unfortunatly I&#39;ve never seen it anywhere else, despite it being a really cool &quot;trick&quot;. Thaught it a lot of other engineers who where learing about MPLS and BGP and it makes me happy seeing it&#39;s still alive with EVPN. Thank you.</p>
