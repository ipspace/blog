Since it has all the routes to the other spokes, traffic between spoke sites would be possible without going through the firewall. Spokes could reach each other via the hub, as they are drawn by the default route.</p>\n\n<p>I had a similar use case for a customer in Arista, where currently only the per VRF label allocation mode is supported. We had to be a bit more creative and ended up using two HUB VRFs: one for traffic coming from the spokes (HUB-IN) and one for traffic going to the spokes (HUB-OUT). The first HUB VRF would only export the default route learned from the firewall in MP-BGP, while the second VRF would only import the spokes&#39; routes.</p>\n",

Unfortunatly I&#39;ve never seen it anywhere else, despite it being a really cool &quot;trick&quot;. Thaught it a lot of other engineers who where learing about MPLS and BGP and it makes me happy seeing it&#39;s still alive with EVPN. Thank you.</p>\n",
