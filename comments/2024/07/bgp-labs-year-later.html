<p>Do you think, realistically in 2024, netlab would suffice to prepare the CCIE lab exam? Particulary for the SP flavor, since netlab support a lot of routing protocols.
Thanks!</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Ivan,</p>

<p>If you ever want to do something similar for IS-IS, I&#39;d be happy to help.</p>

<p>I think it would already be helpful to just cover the basics of IS-IS. There is so little knowledge about IS-IS out there, that any new good resource would be awesome.</p>

<p>I would hate to see in a few years how BGP is remaining as the only IGP in the world. These days, every toy-network thinks it needs BGP. I hear people arguing that BGP has traffic-engineering knobs, and IGPs don&#39;t. :/ They even seem to have forgotten that IGPs have metrics (let alone old fashioned TE, flex-algos, etc).</p>

<p>If people would be interested to learn about the basic of IS-IS, there is always more to teach later. Segment routing, network design, scaling &amp; robustness, fast convergence, and how to troubleshoot it all.</p>

<p>I think your audience is mostly Enterprise Network engineers. They might be more interested in OSPF and BGP. But if you ever wanna do IS-IS, I&#39;d be happy to help.</p>
