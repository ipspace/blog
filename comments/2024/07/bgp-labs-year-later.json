Particulary for the SP flavor, since netlab support a lot of routing protocols.\nThanks!</p>\n",

There is so little knowledge about IS-IS out there, that any new good resource would be awesome.</p>\n\n<p>I would hate to see in a few years how BGP is remaining as the only IGP in the world. These days, every toy-network thinks it needs BGP. I hear people arguing that BGP has traffic-engineering knobs, and IGPs don&#39;t. :/ They even seem to have forgotten that IGPs have metrics (let alone old fashioned TE, flex-algos, etc).</p>\n\n<p>If people would be interested to learn about the basic of IS-IS, there is always more to teach later. Segment routing, network design, scaling &amp; robustness, fast convergence, and how to troubleshoot it all.</p>\n\n<p>I think your audience is mostly Enterprise Network engineers. They might be more interested in OSPF and BGP. But if you ever wanna do IS-IS, I&#39;d be happy to help.</p>\n",
