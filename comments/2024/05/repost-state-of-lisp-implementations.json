AFAIK, no other major vendor implemented LISP in production gear, and (again, according to Bela) even Cisco is dropping it from some products.</p>\n",

Both control planes are supported, but it was originally the case that choosing LISP meant a DNA and ISE lock in. Other vendors seem to be choosing BGP EVPN for network virtualisation, so will choosing LISP still mean a form of vendor lock in?</p>\n",
