         "html": "<p>I used this technique on a Sup720 on the Cat 6500 platform.  The FIB could only hold 239k prefixes.  After that it would process switch, which was death on that platform.</p>\n\n<p>We had a full Internet table in the BGP database.  The RAM was not the problem, it held the entire Internet.  But the FIB was the limit.</p>\n\n<p>With the table-map command we could selectively load only certain routes into the RIB, which would then load into the FIB.</p>\n\n<p>The syntax was non-intuitive.  Table-map was designed to adjust the prefixes before loading them into the RIB, not eliminate them entirely!  I tried to set the admin distance of the undesired routes to 255 (unreachable) but the CLI didn&#39;t take it.  I got it to work by setting the metric to 4294967295.  I only knew that was the largest number by using the &quot;?&quot; in the CLI.</p>\n\n<p>That did it!  Something with metric 4294967295 was unreachable, so it didn&#39;t load into the RIB/FIB.</p>\n",

It particularly solves or rather prevents the need of flooding full tables into the network devices beyond the edge (border) routers, small, medium and big networks.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, if I had a DIA/Transit customer, they do not peer with my PE router, my PE router will transport that customer&#39;s L2 over a pseudowire back to my real edge, whereby there, they directly peer with my full table-capable router (and should they choose, which I recommend, get a full table export from my side to their side as well).</p>\n\n<p>P/PEs would only have a few entries of each other&#39;s loopbacks for LDP/BGP signalled VPLS etc. Not more than a few tens or hundreds routes tops.</p>\n",
