After that it would process switch, which was death on that platform.</p>\n\n<p>We had a full Internet table in the BGP database.  The RAM was not the problem, it held the entire Internet.  But the FIB was the limit.</p>\n\n<p>With the table-map command we could selectively load only certain routes into the RIB, which would then load into the FIB.</p>\n\n<p>The syntax was non-intuitive.  Table-map was designed to adjust the prefixes before loading them into the RIB, not eliminate them entirely!  I tried to set the admin distance of the undesired routes to 255 (unreachable) but the CLI didn&#39;t take it.  I got it to work by setting the metric to 4294967295.  I only knew that was the largest number by using the &quot;?&quot; in the CLI.</p>\n\n<p>That did it!  Something with metric 4294967295 was unreachable, so it didn&#39;t load into the RIB/FIB.</p>\n",
