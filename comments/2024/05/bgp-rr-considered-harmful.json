         "html": "<p>One can use dynamic bgp neighbors on the RR side, specifying an allowed range of neighbor IP addresses. That way, you do not have to touch the RR (e.g. spine) when adding new leaves, and configuration is automatically correct when removing leaves too.</p>\n\n<p>In case of multiple redundant RRs, there is never an inconsistency between those nodes.</p>\n\n<p>The use of RR with dynamic neighbors allows for a minimal set of required config changes when expanding - less error prone, and more scalable.</p>\n",
