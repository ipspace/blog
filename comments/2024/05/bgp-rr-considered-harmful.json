That way, you do not have to touch the RR (e.g. spine) when adding new leaves, and configuration is automatically correct when removing leaves too.</p>\n\n<p>In case of multiple redundant RRs, there is never an inconsistency between those nodes.</p>\n\n<p>The use of RR with dynamic neighbors allows for a minimal set of required config changes when expanding - less error prone, and more scalable.</p>\n",
