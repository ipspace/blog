VPN between 2 VMs on the same network - stupid on display.<br /><br />3) I have watched switches with BPDU guard allow VMware to become the root bridge. That was interesting. <br /><br />4) No STP, no issue...",

ERPS and REP can provide very fast convergence (~50ms) after a topology change in addition to loop prevention.  Unlike spanning-tree, you can&#39;t just turn these protocols on and let them do their magic.  The engineer needs to do some pre-planning to determine what network paths will be REP segments or ERPS domains; you know, the old trick called using the human brain.  Upon hearing this last point, most folks toss the ERPS / REP whitepaper in the wastebasket.",

In the old days if there was an stp related code bug or something where STP &quot;caused&quot; a loop or in a re-convergence STP did not work properly thus resulting in a loop then yes you can say it was an STP failure.<br /><br />However, if your network is not planned/designed to utilize STP properly and you have an STP convergence from a HW outage or something and STP works, blocks the ports to create a loop but that resultant topology is causing other issues with our servers etc it is not an STP issue.
