      "html": "IMHO, this is one of the idiosyncrasies of Cisco IOS. Why should a route with invalid Next-Hop be considered valid ? IMHO such a route should be considered invalid, as any route that does not participate to the BGP selection process. I would have used one more letter to indicate this phenomenon in the first column of the &quot;show ip bgp&quot; (or the newer version &quot;show bgp ipv4 unicast&quot;), instead of the &quot;*&quot;, which in this case is surely misleading. <br />Junos, for instance, put routes with inaccessible Next-Hop in the &quot;hidden&quot; part of  the routing table, you don&#39;t see them in the the routing table (you may see them using &quot;show route hidden&quot;).<br /><br />But I would like to make you another question concerning BGP Next-Hop. Are we sure that a route with &quot;not pingable&quot; Next-Hop never participates to the BGP selection process. The obvious answer is &quot;Are you new to BGP ? For sure a route with &quot;not pingable&quot; Next-Hop DOES NOT participate to the BGP selection process&quot;. WRONG ! It could sound incredible but it can happen (it happened to me, and also see this discussion : https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/message/160879#160879).<br /><br />Don&#39;t you think that this is a &quot;big bug&quot; ? You may see this behaviour both in IOS and Junos. I strongly disagree with their point of view !!! They should do something to correct this behaviour (I have to investigate further, perhaps something has been done on Cisco IOS XR, but I&#39;m not sure).",

I do not think either that Cisco uses the word &quot;valid&quot; conforming to Section 6 of RFC 4271.

You can see the former in the routing table while you can see the latter only in the &quot;hidden&quot; part of the routing table.<br /><br />But what really worries me is the definition of &quot;unreachable Next-Hop&quot;. According to IOS and Junos, a Next-Hop is considered unreachable even if it is not pingable (tested it, a default-route is sufficient to declare the Next-Hop reachable !).
