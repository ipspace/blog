I usually don&#39;t talk about futures.<br /><br />What &quot;suboptimal&quot; is depends on your environment. Most data centers (apart from a few outliers) don&#39;t have more than 10K VMs, which can easily fit into 200 properly sized physical hosts, so almost any product I mentioned can handle them. <br /><br />If you need more, then you probably know how to get there.<br /><br />Ah, the point... there are some controllers that scale to gigantic proportions in real-life production environment, and then there are some things that can never scale due to the architecture they use.",

If NSX, ACI, Hyper-V would be suboptimal, what would be a good SDN/Cloud architecture today? Should we treat the SDN part independently of the cloud orchestration?<br /><br /><br />",

You simply cannot count on the vendor marketing whitepapers to tell the whole story, and you cannot rely on every vendor architecting and implementing their solution correctly.<br /><br />Everything works well in PowerPoint - vCDNI looked fantastic, as did a few other already-dead products.",

I have run a number of vCDNI implementations without issue, but there were not addons. The network was designed with the intent of vCDNI riding on top. <br /><br />What I did enjoy reading this week was Brocades technology to read VMware vDS environments and configure the physical network accordingly. That was pretty slick.",

      "html": "I believe this highlights an issue with network engineers discussing SDN. The second word in SDN is Defined. When the conversation devolves into data-plane and flows, the train has already derailed. <br /><br />SDN&#39;s purpose is to provide non-network engineer persons with the ability to create/manage/orchestrate their own network needs. VMware and Microsoft are much better add driving this paradigm as they are NOT network focused. They are service focused and want to enable their customers to manage the network like any other wizard. <br /><br />So, when Cisco (et. al.) create a programmable single dashboard from which one can define an end to end network, then they will have an SDN technology. If we look at VMware, their SDN solution allows someone vaguely familiar with networking to define segments, subnets, routes, firewalls, and load balancing with a guided wizard - how many segments? connected or isolated? how many hosts? At the end, it presents a basic graphical representation of where your servers are and the network behind them. If you like it, click go and the configuration is deployed. <br /><br />This is SDN. Treating the network as a consumable resource molded to the requirements of its consumers on the fly. All the other &quot;stuff&quot; usually comes from network hardware vendors trying to remain relevant. Rather SDN is accomplished in software or hardware is really unimportant. However, as virtualization continues to reach deeper into the enterprise stack, software will be more likely.",
