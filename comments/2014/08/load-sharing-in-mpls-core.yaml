  html: Ivan, I am wondering how widely MPLS is used in today&#39;s SP networks. It
    used to be the craze in early to mid 2000s. But of late there is not much excitement
    around MPLS. MPLS based L3 VPN was probably the killer feature. Is it still widely
    deployed ? How about other features like TE/L2VPN/VPLS ?

  html: This would have to be per-packet load-balancing, since router B would not
    have any awareness of IP flows coming from Router A, no?<br /><br />Also, what
    does the &quot;Per-destination load-sharing&quot; mean in the context of the &quot;show
    mpls forwarding-table 10.0.1.6 detail&quot;?  Would this apply only to IP traffic
    arriving at the router without an MPLS header (and without a VPN label)?  And
    since the destination is a /32 anyway, would the load sharing choice displayed
    essentially mean no load-balacing?
