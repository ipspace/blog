      "html": "Ivan, I am wondering how widely MPLS is used in today&#39;s SP networks. It used to be the craze in early to mid 2000s. But of late there is not much excitement around MPLS. MPLS based L3 VPN was probably the killer feature. Is it still widely deployed ? How about other features like TE/L2VPN/VPLS ?",

Would this apply only to IP traffic arriving at the router without an MPLS header (and without a VPN label)?  And since the destination is a /32 anyway, would the load sharing choice displayed essentially mean no load-balacing?",
