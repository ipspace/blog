      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />In the first video, you introduce the new Brocade VDX6740 switchs and state that they don&#39;t have FC ports.<br /><br />I&#39;m sorry to correct on this, but it&#39;s wrong as some (if not all !?! I can&#39;t seem to remember) of the 48 10G ports can be used as FC switchs. I believe it&#39;s something that will be available with the release of NOS5.0 if memory serves.<br /><br />Best regards.<br /><br />",
