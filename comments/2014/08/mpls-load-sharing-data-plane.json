      "html": "Some implementations allow the use of a Control Word (RFC 4385) to disable ECMP for L2 payloads. The format of the Control Word guarantees that the first nibble is not 0x4 or 0x6.<br /><br />The L2 ECMP solution you&#39;ve described is FAT PW, wherein an &quot;entropy&quot; label gets<br />pushed at the bottom of the label stack.  Entropy Labels is a similar solution with broader scope i.e. it can be used for any payload. An ingress LER pushes an Entropy<br />Label and an Entropy Label Indicator (ELI) right before it pushes the Transport Label.<br /><br />FAT PW: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6391<br />Entropy Labels: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6790<br /><br />Broad adoption of the above RFCs should remove the need for arcane, platform dependent knobs to control MPLS transit load sharing behavior.<br /><br />",
