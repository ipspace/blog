  html: A few points<br /><br />1) Infrastructure personnel want every port hot and
    active. I don&#39;t buy 200 interfaces to only be able to use 100 of them.<br
    /><br />2) The admins you highlighted in your linked post should be fired. VPN
    between 2 VMs on the same network - stupid on display.<br /><br />3) I have watched
    switches with BPDU guard allow VMware to become the root bridge. That was interesting.
    <br /><br />4) No STP, no issue...

    html: Do any major vendors implement this?

    html: Yes.  Calix, Cisco, Juniper and I&#39;m sure many other vendors support
      ERPS (a.k.a. ITU-T G.8032).  Another similar protocol is Cisco&#39;s REP.  ERPS
      and REP can provide very fast convergence (~50ms) after a topology change in
      addition to loop prevention.  Unlike spanning-tree, you can&#39;t just turn
      these protocols on and let them do their magic.  The engineer needs to do some
      pre-planning to determine what network paths will be REP segments or ERPS domains;
      you know, the old trick called using the human brain.  Upon hearing this last
      point, most folks toss the ERPS / REP whitepaper in the wastebasket.

    html: ERPS and EAPS-MRRP-like solutions are good but they only works with actual
      ring topologies.

  html: G.8032 is yet another standardized L2 loop prevention protocol. In fact a
    lot of people are preferring it over xSTP.

  html: If this is anything like extreme networks eaps it isn&#39;t loop prevention
    as much as it is a very nice l2 redundancy protocol.  <br /><br />You (network
    admin) provision primary and fail over paths through the network and it works
    nicely. Some nimrod bridges the network elsewhere and you&#39;re still toast.
    <br /><br />Eaps was very nice when i used it; reading the Cisco config guide
    leads me to think 8032 is just samesame.

  html: Some folks get STP and failure mixed up.  In the old days if there was an
    stp related code bug or something where STP &quot;caused&quot; a loop or in a
    re-convergence STP did not work properly thus resulting in a loop then yes you
    can say it was an STP failure.<br /><br />However, if your network is not planned/designed
    to utilize STP properly and you have an STP convergence from a HW outage or something
    and STP works, blocks the ports to create a loop but that resultant topology is
    causing other issues with our servers etc it is not an STP issue. STP did its
    job.
