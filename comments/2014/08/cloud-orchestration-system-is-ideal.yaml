  html: The testing methodology is very different.   N1K scale limit shows when all
    the features are provisioned; vDS shows when the least features are used.<br /><br
    />In a networking company, sometimes it is hard to accept a limit without networking
    features are configured. :)

    html: I meant the Nexus 1000V in its currently shipping and documented form, based
      on its most-recent release notes. I usually don&#39;t talk about futures.<br
      /><br />What &quot;suboptimal&quot; is depends on your environment. Most data
      centers (apart from a few outliers) don&#39;t have more than 10K VMs, which
      can easily fit into 200 properly sized physical hosts, so almost any product
      I mentioned can handle them. <br /><br />If you need more, then you probably
      know how to get there.<br /><br />Ah, the point... there are some controllers
      that scale to gigantic proportions in real-life production environment, and
      then there are some things that can never scale due to the architecture they
      use.

  html: Did you meant the 1000V used in ACI compared to NSX or without ACI?<br /><br
    />Also, not sure to get the point of your post. If NSX, ACI, Hyper-V would be
    suboptimal, what would be a good SDN/Cloud architecture today? Should we treat
    the SDN part independently of the cloud orchestration?<br /><br /><br />

    html: While I perfectly agree with most of what you said (including the end goal),
      it is important that at least a few of us keep the laws of physics and real-life
      constraints in mind. You simply cannot count on the vendor marketing whitepapers
      to tell the whole story, and you cannot rely on every vendor architecting and
      implementing their solution correctly.<br /><br />Everything works well in PowerPoint
      - vCDNI looked fantastic, as did a few other already-dead products.

    html: Thank you, and I agree that all of these technologies (physical and virtual)
      must be validated. I have run a number of vCDNI implementations without issue,
      but there were not addons. The network was designed with the intent of vCDNI
      riding on top. <br /><br />What I did enjoy reading this week was Brocades technology
      to read VMware vDS environments and configure the physical network accordingly.
      That was pretty slick.

  html: I believe this highlights an issue with network engineers discussing SDN.
    The second word in SDN is Defined. When the conversation devolves into data-plane
    and flows, the train has already derailed. <br /><br />SDN&#39;s purpose is to
    provide non-network engineer persons with the ability to create/manage/orchestrate
    their own network needs. VMware and Microsoft are much better add driving this
    paradigm as they are NOT network focused. They are service focused and want to
    enable their customers to manage the network like any other wizard. <br /><br
    />So, when Cisco (et. al.) create a programmable single dashboard from which one
    can define an end to end network, then they will have an SDN technology. If we
    look at VMware, their SDN solution allows someone vaguely familiar with networking
    to define segments, subnets, routes, firewalls, and load balancing with a guided
    wizard - how many segments? connected or isolated? how many hosts? At the end,
    it presents a basic graphical representation of where your servers are and the
    network behind them. If you like it, click go and the configuration is deployed.
    <br /><br />This is SDN. Treating the network as a consumable resource molded
    to the requirements of its consumers on the fly. All the other &quot;stuff&quot;
    usually comes from network hardware vendors trying to remain relevant. Rather
    SDN is accomplished in software or hardware is really unimportant. However, as
    virtualization continues to reach deeper into the enterprise stack, software will
    be more likely.
