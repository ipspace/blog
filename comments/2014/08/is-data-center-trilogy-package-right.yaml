  html: I had similar issue with vm/it team 3 years ago. Talking and frightening them,
    finally helped. Unfortunately we (net) have to give way fields and go for some
    compromises. We agreed for L2 on vm network but backed infrastructure is pure
    L3. vm/it know and understand the risk.

  html: 'Same here, similar issue 3 years ago.... After reading a lot about it we
    managed to avoid setting up L2 DCI: we had so many arguments against L2 DCI that
    VM team finally agreed to setup L3 DCI. What helped us? Reading Trilogy webinar
    and even reading Oracle and IBM recommendations (Oracle recommended us to setup
    Data Guard to maximize availability and data protection, and IBM recommends that
    WAS cells do not span DCs)...  Now we have 2 x dark fiber which we use to replicate
    Storage Arrays and 2 x dark fibere which we use to route traffic between DC, and
    we are quite happy this way. Not sure about VM team, but network is definitely
    more stable and outages have not impacted that much in critical services deployed
    in both DCs.'

  html: I view Long Distance vMotion as a  technology for facilitating migration of
    an individual non-redundant enterprise datacenter by minimizing downtime of each
    individual workload.<br /><br />Understanding that;  until the migration is completed,
    an outage at EITHER datacenter  or the connection between them is a potential
    risk and would cause serious problems.   Combine a simultaneous vMotion and storage
    vMotion,  and the workload moves.<br /><br />As soon as everything is moved,  shutdown
    the old datacenter.<br /><br /><br />
