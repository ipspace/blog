      "html": "Same here, similar issue 3 years ago.... After reading a lot about it we managed to avoid setting up L2 DCI: we had so many arguments against L2 DCI that VM team finally agreed to setup L3 DCI. What helped us? Reading Trilogy webinar and even reading Oracle and IBM recommendations (Oracle recommended us to setup Data Guard to maximize availability and data protection, and IBM recommends that WAS cells do not span DCs)...  Now we have 2 x dark fiber which we use to replicate Storage Arrays and 2 x dark fibere which we use to route traffic between DC, and we are quite happy this way. Not sure about VM team, but network is definitely more stable and outages have not impacted that much in critical services deployed in both DCs.",

Combine a simultaneous vMotion and storage vMotion,  and the workload moves.<br /><br />As soon as everything is moved,  shutdown the old datacenter.<br /><br /><br />",
