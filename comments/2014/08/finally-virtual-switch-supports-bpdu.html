            <div class="comment-content">Additionally there is BGP Control Plane support (only 8 VSMs it looks like) -- release notes are a bit light on details, but could be interesting to see how it works to see if its viable at higher scale for larger deployments and deployments in hardware/software mix. There also is storm control support finally (it was promised in this release months ago but obviously the software was never released until recently). Could be interesting as a way to rate limit BUM traffic within a bridge-domain... interesting implications if BUM traffic ceases to be a &#39;problem&#39;. </div>
