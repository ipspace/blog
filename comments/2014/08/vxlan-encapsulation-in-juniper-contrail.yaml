    html: Straight from http://opencontrail.org/opencontrail-architecture-documentation/
      (section 2.2.1.2):<br /><br />&quot;Second, The Virtual Network Identifier (VNI)
      in the VXLAN header is locally unique to the egress vRouter instead of being
      globally unique.&quot;<br /><br />Sounds like MPLS label to me. What you want
      to call that field is pure semantics ,)<br /><br />Or maybe your architecture
      document is out-of-date, in which case someone might want to fix it.

    html: The document refers to the implementation of locally significant VNIs as
      described in draft-sd-l2vpn-evpn-overlay. I agree that they are conceptually
      similar to MPLS labels.<br /><br />The point I would like to clarify is that
      per the above draft, VXLAN encap is used only when the destination prefix has
      a VNI associated with it e.g. a MAC address learnt via BGP EVPN route with Encapsulation
      Extended Community value VXLAN. It&#39;s not used if the destination prefix
      has an MPLS label associated with it e.g. IP prefix learnt via BGP L3VPN route.<br
      /><br />We&#39;ve since discovered that merchant silicon TORs tend to only support
      globally unique VNIs. Hence newer releases of Contrail software will switch
      over to using globally unique VNIs.  The section you referred to above will
      need to be updated at that point.<br />

  html: 'Current version of Contrail uses VXLAN encapsulation to carry non-IP traffic
    between VMs across hypervisors. The VXLAN payload is the original Ethernet frame.
    An upcoming release will support use of VXLAN to carry IP and non-IP traffic between
    VMs and non-virtualized hosts connected to merchant silicon based TORs. The VXLAN
    payload will still be the original Ethernet frame.<br /><br />The EVPN + VXLAN
    implementation is based on the following:<br /><br />https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-l2vpn-evpn/<br
    />https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-sd-l2vpn-evpn-overlay/<br /><br />IOW,
    the VNI field in the VXLAN header is not used to store an MPLS label.<br /><br
    />On a related note, draft-sd-l2vpn-evpn-overlay does use the MPLS label field
    in BGP EVPN Routes to signal the VNI in the control plane. The data plane remains
    vanilla VXLAN.<br /><br />Disclosure: I work in the Contrail team at Juniper<br

  html: Ivan, you sounds like network industry hipster sometimes. Keep it up! I like
    this ironic sense of humor.
