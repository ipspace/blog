            <div class="comment-content">&quot;In a typical enterprise data center it might take a few days to implement a new firewall or load balancing rule, and a few weeks to deploy a new application.&quot;<br /><br />...which is usually coming from the change process, enforced by the customer(s) and/or business lines. In this case, an orchestrator with a web based GUI would shorten the few days with a few minutes, not reduce the few days to a few minutes. :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">True, I agree it&#39;s mostly a process constraint, getting approvals, sign offs, keying in POs and work breakdown structures into SAP, etc ... Then there I are the ITIL like change mgmt hurdles and hoops to jump through and then the customer coordination. I don&#39;t think SDN will reduce timelines significantly but where it might bring value is in eliminating errors, self/auto-documentation and determinism over traffic</div>
