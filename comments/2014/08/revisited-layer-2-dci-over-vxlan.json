I agree, its certainly not good for DCI, just playing devils advocate for fun!<br /><br />One last question -- assuming you did deploy redundant VSMs in each of two data centers, if the DCI link fails is it really that big of a deal for the VSMs to go split-brained? If they can maintain operations within each DC that would be better than being totally broken I would think.",

      "html": "Interesting to read the comments in the &#39;VXLAN is not a Data Center Interconnect&#39; post from 2012 :)<br />Still no control-plane, still basically the same landscape with maybe just a bit broader support. <br /><br />I&#39;d be interested to hear your thoughts on unicast-mode VXLAN vs &#39;standard&#39; (draft) VXLAN when it comes to layer 2 extension (while I&#39;m 100% with you that the &#39;requirement&#39; for layer 2 extension is a mostly/entirely BS requirement). I&#39;m not fully versed in how all the magic happens, but I would assume that the VSM acts as some sort of control plane, and helps to create the VTEP to MAC mappings... I would suspect that this would help to alleviate some of the MAC flooding issues that aren&#39;t (adequately) addressed in multicast mode? As a further bandaid (definitely not a &#39;real&#39; solution) I wonder about the effectiveness of implementing storm-control on port-profiles in the 1000v as an extra method to limit broadcast storm type traffic within the bridge-domain. <br /><br />Of course none of this addresses the traffic trombone issues, or lack of active/active gateway type functionality (outside of NSX I guess? Also to an extent ACI I suppose). Of course there are also some scale limitations to consider with unicast-mode VXLAN -- particularly surrounding the gateway functionality.<br /><br />Lastly, although this would *never* fly in a production environment, for kicks you could deploy a CSR with an interface in a VXLAN, and use it to extend the VXLAN to a VLAN in another data-center... its filthy, but it works... in a lab... :)<br /><br />Carl",

However, IIRC it&#39;s only supported on Nexus 7000s and requires both licenses for the VDC option as well as OTV (last time I looked - it might have changed) so if you&#39;re not a Cisco shop, or you don&#39;t have Nexus 7000s, then VXLAN may well be the least horrible option. There are plenty of things that support VXLAN (if you&#39;re using VMware then the Nexus 1000v, or VCNS or NSX would all do the job)",

If you went the VXLAN route, and have bare metal servers (or maybe other VMs that don&#39;t live in ESX) that need access to the servers on the VXLAN segment, they have to go through the VXLAN gateway which might be on the opposite side of the DCI, resulting in tromboning. <br /><br />I wonder if what the cost of the added latency and bandwidth usage of the DCI is, and if it would be offset by just purchasing something that supports OTV.<br /><br />Semi-related fun fact: OTV has an RFC draft (currently expired though) out there so it looks like the intention is to let anyone use OTV. <br />http://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-hasmit-otv-04.txt",

      "html": "&quot;VXLAN is the least horrible technology&quot;<br /><br />Could you please elaborate on how VXLAN is a better option than OTV? As far as I can see, OTV doesn&#39;t suffer from the traffic tromboning you get from VXLAN. Sure you have to stretch your VLANs, but you&#39;re protected from bridging failures going over your DCI. OTV is also able to have multiple edge devices per site, so there&#39;s no single failure domain. It&#39;s even integrated with LISP to mitigate any sub-optimal traffic flows.<br /><br />If I simply misinterpreted your post, I apologize.",

      "html": "Ivan, regarding what you said : &quot;Traffic trombones generated by stateful appliances (inter-subnet firewalls or load balancers) are impossible to solve.&quot;<br /><br />&gt; Is this still your view? Some Firewalls are capable of synchronizing their states (sessions) with other members, yet they are in StandAlone (not in cluster), would you say this can resolve the &quot;stretched cluster&quot; problems ?<br /><br />IMHO, this may resolve some problems:<br />&gt; The cluster (especially the A/P) mode which can be seen as a single failure domain (software problem/bug...)<br />&gt; The Asymmetric flow/routing (i.e. no need for LISP if &quot;Traffic trombones&quot; is not a problem)<br /><br />So now, we may add as many Firewalls to the topology which becomes like a &quot;Firewall Fabric&quot; :)",
