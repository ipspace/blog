            <div class="comment-content">The testing methodology is very different.   N1K scale limit shows when all the features are provisioned; vDS shows when the least features are used.<br /><br />In a networking company, sometimes it is hard to accept a limit without networking features are configured. :)</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Did you meant the 1000V used in ACI compared to NSX or without ACI?<br /><br />Also, not sure to get the point of your post. If NSX, ACI, Hyper-V would be suboptimal, what would be a good SDN/Cloud architecture today? Should we treat the SDN part independently of the cloud orchestration?<br /><br /><br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">I meant the Nexus 1000V in its currently shipping and documented form, based on its most-recent release notes. I usually don&#39;t talk about futures.<br /><br />What &quot;suboptimal&quot; is depends on your environment. Most data centers (apart from a few outliers) don&#39;t have more than 10K VMs, which can easily fit into 200 properly sized physical hosts, so almost any product I mentioned can handle them. <br /><br />If you need more, then you probably know how to get there.<br /><br />Ah, the point... there are some controllers that scale to gigantic proportions in real-life production environment, and then there are some things that can never scale due to the architecture they use.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I believe this highlights an issue with network engineers discussing SDN. The second word in SDN is Defined. When the conversation devolves into data-plane and flows, the train has already derailed. <br /><br />SDN&#39;s purpose is to provide non-network engineer persons with the ability to create/manage/orchestrate their own network needs. VMware and Microsoft are much better add driving this paradigm as they are NOT network focused. They are service focused and want to enable their customers to manage the network like any other wizard. <br /><br />So, when Cisco (et. al.) create a programmable single dashboard from which one can define an end to end network, then they will have an SDN technology. If we look at VMware, their SDN solution allows someone vaguely familiar with networking to define segments, subnets, routes, firewalls, and load balancing with a guided wizard - how many segments? connected or isolated? how many hosts? At the end, it presents a basic graphical representation of where your servers are and the network behind them. If you like it, click go and the configuration is deployed. <br /><br />This is SDN. Treating the network as a consumable resource molded to the requirements of its consumers on the fly. All the other &quot;stuff&quot; usually comes from network hardware vendors trying to remain relevant. Rather SDN is accomplished in software or hardware is really unimportant. However, as virtualization continues to reach deeper into the enterprise stack, software will be more likely.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">While I perfectly agree with most of what you said (including the end goal), it is important that at least a few of us keep the laws of physics and real-life constraints in mind. You simply cannot count on the vendor marketing whitepapers to tell the whole story, and you cannot rely on every vendor architecting and implementing their solution correctly.<br /><br />Everything works well in PowerPoint - vCDNI looked fantastic, as did a few other already-dead products.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Thank you, and I agree that all of these technologies (physical and virtual) must be validated. I have run a number of vCDNI implementations without issue, but there were not addons. The network was designed with the intent of vCDNI riding on top. <br /><br />What I did enjoy reading this week was Brocades technology to read VMware vDS environments and configure the physical network accordingly. That was pretty slick.</div>
