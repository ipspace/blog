They decided to use a 1000 multiplier so they guarantee that they have some memory left for those structures.<br />I think that (I&#39;ll be using IEC numbers http://www.iec.ch/si/binary.htm):<br />-IPv4 strucute uses 4KiB (4096 bytes)<br />-IPv6 structure uses 8KiB (8192 bytes) <br /><br />512000*4KiB=2000 MiB (2097152000 bytes)<br />256000*8KiB=2000 MiB (2097152000 bytes)<br /><br />4 &quot;GB memory&quot; = 4GiB = 4294967296 bytes<br />Service data avaliable: 4 GiB - 2*(2000 MiB) = 96 MiB (100663296 bytes)<br />",

Some 6500 outputs show (available after googling):<br />72 bits (IPv4, MPLS, EoM) 524288 432158 82%<br />You see the 512*1024.<br />I still think that people having those problems were having more routes because of OSPF, VRF routes and/or MPLS labels. They consume the same space, thus leaving less space available for the big BGP table.<br />",
