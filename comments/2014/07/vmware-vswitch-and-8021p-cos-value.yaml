    html: That&#39;s exactly what I wrote - and if you use VLAN 4095, the VM has to
      know the proper VLAN ID to use. Why would you want to set that up if all you
      need is CoS tagging?

    html: 'Another way to look at it is should the VM owner be able to prioritize
      his own traffic? Should not that be done by Network admin at the infrastructure
      level via Resource Pool tagging?<br /><br />No comment on the licensing. This
      is business decision - you also make your webinars payware. '

  html: Both vSS and vDS support virtual guest tagging. In vSS you use VLAN 4095 in
    vDS you specify VLAN ranges. On top of that with vDS and NetIOC you can create
    custom network resource pools, define their CoS and assign them to port groups.

  html: The VM owner should be able to supply the CoS values he could supply if he
    had a physical server, yes;    the network admin might (or might)  not reason
    to decide  what to do or not to do with those declarations the VM owner has put
    in the packets&#39; priority fields.<br /> <br />Ivan didn&#39;t sell webinars
    with some of the important parts bleeped out and  &quot;come pay us $4000 extra
    per server in your datacenter,  if you want to come find out what you missed&quot;.<br

  html: First, you engineer a full networking stack and try not to pull some benefit
    out of it. This is directly running against legacy vendors. You want the goodies,
    pay up. <br /><br />Conversely, a lot of virtualization farms treat the last mile
    (vswitch) as a dumb pathway. Everything should be line rate at that point with
    any-to-any availability. COS and QOS in general should not apply as there is no
    contention. <br /><br />I agree above, that applications should rarely declare
    their own values. We all know that they will select the priority queues as theirs
    is the most important. We end up back at zero. <br /><br />What use case does
    this really solve?<br /><br />COS/QOS make sense at the border or across the WAN.
    Inside the DC, where VMware resides, it makes far less sense.

  html: '&quot;You can probably guess how much it irritates me when VMware marketing
    tries to tell us that the network stands in everyone&#39;s way instead of giving
    people the tools they need to get their job done correctly.&quot;<br /><br />It&#39;s
    a shame that VMWare has done this has gotten away with it.  Sad truth is most
    of IT is run by folks that really don&#39;t care about the details.'
