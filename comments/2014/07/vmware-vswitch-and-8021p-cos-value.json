Should not that be done by Network admin at the infrastructure level via Resource Pool tagging?<br /><br />No comment on the licensing. This is business decision - you also make your webinars payware. ",

      "html": "First, you engineer a full networking stack and try not to pull some benefit out of it. This is directly running against legacy vendors. You want the goodies, pay up. <br /><br />Conversely, a lot of virtualization farms treat the last mile (vswitch) as a dumb pathway. Everything should be line rate at that point with any-to-any availability. COS and QOS in general should not apply as there is no contention. <br /><br />I agree above, that applications should rarely declare their own values. We all know that they will select the priority queues as theirs is the most important. We end up back at zero. <br /><br />What use case does this really solve?<br /><br />COS/QOS make sense at the border or across the WAN. Inside the DC, where VMware resides, it makes far less sense.",
