      "html": "Hi,<br /><br />what I&#39;ve wondered since VXLAN first showed up along with other &quot;half-proprietary&quot; options, why is this used over other vlan &quot;tunnel&quot; solutions (I think there&#39;s S-VLAN? and, of course, QinQ?).<br /><br />I&#39;ll try to re-read the post a few more times, but I&#39;ve really never understood why we needed one more &quot;trunk&quot; standard.<br />(I&#39;m aware everything has flaws, i.e. i think there was bad support for qinq in Linux, not letting you set the ethertype because someone didn&#39;t *get* it.)<br /><br />Still, is there any big advantage in the VXLAN way of things over normal &quot;stacked VLAN&quot; setups?",

      "html": "@darkfaber: VXLAN was introduced because it supports tunneling over IP Fabrics and because it has good support for multipath (entropy in UDP source port).  S-VLAN and QinQ cannot tunnel over an IP Fabric; they only support Ethernet Fabrics.  IP Fabrics are more scalable than Ethernet Fabrics.",

That&#39;s nice in the way Network Dinos can focus on things that matter (aka the upper layer). And not provision VLANs on dumb switches all day long, for a virtual admin team that doesn&#39;t understand their own technology anyway.",
