      "html": "Techies need to learn that Excel is their friend. Create a model, it can&#39;t and doesn&#39;t have to be 100% true or real. Find the rules of thumb capacity engineering rules, code them into the spreadsheet. The next time your star salesperson or CEO come to you with this great opportunity you have something to temper their enthusiasm.  I came into a situation where nobody could figure out what the impact of selling a service to the end customer. I created a model that calculates bandwidth, packets per second, concurrent sessions and number of servers, storage and switch ports. I have no idea if it&#39;s right or wrong but it is consistent and when I back tested it, it gave me number close to reality. Took me 6 months but the confidence you get when the big boys realize you have a handle on the numbers is priceless.",

Yes, you can build one successfully without this info, but it won&#39;t be aligned and you will afterwards be playing catch up trying to determine SLAs, Chargeback, Accounting, and Capacity Management.<br /><br />Someone will wind up with a budget hit and project resources with no way to tie any of the expenses to the benefits you should be realizing from the cloud strategy.
