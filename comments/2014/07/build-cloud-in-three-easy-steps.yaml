  html: Damn you Ivan!! I came here to learn how to build a cloud in 3 easy steps.<br
    /><br />Valid points though. Requirements drive the solution, not the other way
    around.

  html: Techies need to learn that Excel is their friend. Create a model, it can&#39;t
    and doesn&#39;t have to be 100% true or real. Find the rules of thumb capacity
    engineering rules, code them into the spreadsheet. The next time your star salesperson
    or CEO come to you with this great opportunity you have something to temper their
    enthusiasm.  I came into a situation where nobody could figure out what the impact
    of selling a service to the end customer. I created a model that calculates bandwidth,
    packets per second, concurrent sessions and number of servers, storage and switch
    ports. I have no idea if it&#39;s right or wrong but it is consistent and when
    I back tested it, it gave me number close to reality. Took me 6 months but the
    confidence you get when the big boys realize you have a handle on the numbers
    is priceless.

  html: My opinion, if you cannot answer the question, &quot;how much does it cost
    to run my network and how much will I charge for infrastructure and services?&quot;,
    you really shouldn&#39;t be building a cloud. Yes, you can build one successfully
    without this info, but it won&#39;t be aligned and you will afterwards be playing
    catch up trying to determine SLAs, Chargeback, Accounting, and Capacity Management.<br
    /><br />Someone will wind up with a budget hit and project resources with no way
    to tie any of the expenses to the benefits you should be realizing from the cloud
    strategy. Ask me how I know...<br /><br />CWB
