            <div class="comment-content">This is an interesting topic, and lately I find this type of conversation is coming up more and more often as load balancing, QoS, and Wan optimization requests keep coming in for applications being centralized. (IPSs and firewalls have died down.) <br /><br />Many of the application owners struggle with the details. Latency is one those details that is misunderstood when an application was hosted locally and moved even 15-20 ms away. The next conversation goes like this...<br /><br />&quot;It must be placed in the high priority queue&quot;<br />&quot;But your circuit is only 10-20% utilized. QoS doesn&#39;t kick in&quot;<br />&quot;Put it there anyway and we&#39;ll see because it will be better.&quot;<br />&quot;It won&#39;t do anything and it will make our policy more complex&quot;<br />&quot;Well, I have to escalate this to management then...&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;ve wondered why some of the app owners respond this way. I think it comes down to these app owners usually don&#39;t look at a problem and break it down to the basics, and usually don&#39;t have a strong engineering, scientific, or mathematics background. So they just see the surface of the application without asking things like; how does a client connect; is there a dependency on dns, AD forest or domain:  where does the authentication and authorization take place; what kind of data transfer takes place; is it a bulk or serial transfer; does there even need to be a transfer; etc. <br /><br />Although testing with delay before a migration would illustrate some of these issues, it is often not done for various reasons. What I&#39;ve done, is shown is a graph of the effects of latency on throughput for simple-TCP, i.e. no windowing. This has been my most effective method of education without getting too deep. It may not change the design or the project, but it may help the application owners understand the performance differences after a migration.<br /><br />The more scientifically minded application owners will breakdown their application and understand most of the pieces before a centralization project and tend to have a good success rate. All their firewall and load balancing needs are handled before a migration, are well documented, and tend to be simple configurations. If I show the graph, their response is usually, &quot;I understand, but I think we&#39;ve always used sliding windows... BTW - we need a VIP on the load-balancer, round-robin... we&#39;ll take care of persistence on the app side, and we&#39;ll check the health and publish a page if the app is up...&quot;</div>
