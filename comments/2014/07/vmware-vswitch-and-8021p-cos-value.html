            <div class="comment-content">Both vSS and vDS support virtual guest tagging. In vSS you use VLAN 4095 in vDS you specify VLAN ranges. On top of that with vDS and NetIOC you can create custom network resource pools, define their CoS and assign them to port groups.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">That&#39;s exactly what I wrote - and if you use VLAN 4095, the VM has to know the proper VLAN ID to use. Why would you want to set that up if all you need is CoS tagging?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Another way to look at it is should the VM owner be able to prioritize his own traffic? Should not that be done by Network admin at the infrastructure level via Resource Pool tagging?<br /><br />No comment on the licensing. This is business decision - you also make your webinars payware. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">First, you engineer a full networking stack and try not to pull some benefit out of it. This is directly running against legacy vendors. You want the goodies, pay up. <br /><br />Conversely, a lot of virtualization farms treat the last mile (vswitch) as a dumb pathway. Everything should be line rate at that point with any-to-any availability. COS and QOS in general should not apply as there is no contention. <br /><br />I agree above, that applications should rarely declare their own values. We all know that they will select the priority queues as theirs is the most important. We end up back at zero. <br /><br />What use case does this really solve?<br /><br />COS/QOS make sense at the border or across the WAN. Inside the DC, where VMware resides, it makes far less sense.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&quot;You can probably guess how much it irritates me when VMware marketing tries to tell us that the network stands in everyone&#39;s way instead of giving people the tools they need to get their job done correctly.&quot;<br /><br />It&#39;s a shame that VMWare has done this has gotten away with it.  Sad truth is most of IT is run by folks that really don&#39;t care about the details.</div>
