      "html": "Technology has its legacies. Technology has a history. Technology makes history. It\u2019s important to understand history to understand the kludges, as you call them. It all began with the Yellow cable. The original, coaxial Yellow cable is the first medium for IEEE 802.3, Ethernet. It\u2019s a shared medium. Any station attached to the medium can communicate with each other. With stations directly attached to a single, common medium no extra device, no layer-2 bridge (switch) is needed for communication. Initially it was expected that each LAN segment would have its own router to interconnect to another LAN segment. Radia Perlman worked at DEC, the company that together with Intel and Xerox defined the 10 Mb/s DIX standard. In http://www.networkworld.com/article/2202492/lan-wan/living-legends--radia-perlman--layer-3-wizard.html Radia Perlman explains: \u201c\u2018Routing between links was Layer 3&#39;s job. When I tried to argue that we may need to forward packets from one Ethernet link to another, the reply was &#39;Our customers would never want to do that&#39;. Their perception was Layer 3 was just unnecessary bytes on the wire.\u2019 But it didn&#39;t take long for that shortsightedness to become obvious. Customers did, after all, want to talk from one Ethernet to another.\u201d<br />So Radia Perlman invented STP constrained by several requirements. For a station it should not matter if it communicates to a station on the same LAN segment or via a bridge to a station on another LAN segment. Since Ethernet has no TTL value, however, frames could loop forever on a ring. Thus, STP needs to maintain the illusion of a single shared medium. This is why STP builds a tree.<br />Later on with the introduction of twisted pairs as the wired medium, Ethernet\u2019s physical bus topology converged to a physical star topology requiring a central hub that would create the illusion of a shared medium. After all a hub forwards any incoming frames to all ports but the port a frame was received from. With the introduction of learning bridges (switches) Ethernet could have transformed into something even more powerful. However, with a huge installed basis compatibility becomes a key issue and revolution turns into evolution.<br />We all know that STP and large L2 domains have their (severe) limitations. However, without understanding the past it\u2019s very easy to complain about how things have developed.<br />One of the disadvantages of STP that you didn\u2019t mention is the waste of capacity. Because of the tree structure redundant paths cannot be used. Thus, frames might travel much farther than the physical topology would require. Shortest Path Bridging (SPB, 802.1aq) solves all of (R/M)STP\u2019s problems boosting Ethernet into another dimension. At its core SPB runs IS-IS \u2013 another protocol invented by Radia Perlman \u2026<br />",

From a \u201cCisco Validated Design\u201d document entitled \u201cData Center Design \u2013 IP Network Infrastructure\u201d (pps 35-36, October 8, 2009):<br /><br />\u201cTransparent bridging is the result of a long technological evolution that was guided by the desire to keep the property of the thick coaxial cable that was the base for the original Ethernet networks. Transparent means that the stations using the service are not aware that the traffic they are sending is bridged; they are not participating in the bridging effort. The technology is similarly transparent to the user, and a high end Ethernet switch running STP is still supposed to be plug-and-play, just like a coaxial cable or a repeater were. As a result, unlike routers, bridges have to discover whether their ports are connected to peer bridges or plain hosts. In particular, in the absence of control message reception on a port, a bridge will assume that it is connected to a host and will provide connectivity. Therefore, the most significant differences between routing and bridging with STP (spanning tree protocol) are as follows:<br />\u2022 A routing protocol identifies where to send packets.<br />\u2022 STP identifies where not to send frames.<br />The obvious consequence is that if a router fails to receive the appropriate updates, the parts of the network that were relying on this router for communication will not be able to reach each other. This failure tends to be local, as the communication within those distant network parts is not affected. If a bridge misses control information, it will instead open a loop. As it has been observed, this will most likely impact the whole bridging domain.\u201d<br /><br />I summarize this using language that aligns with network security discussions, in which &quot;fail closed&quot; is a safe failure condition vs &quot;fail open&quot;:<br /><br />&quot;To summarize the two major points being made in the quote from Cisco:<br />1. a routed interface will \u201cfail closed\u201d with no impact on any other routed interfaces, while a set of transparently bridged ports defined as a single virtual LAN will \u201cfail open\u201d with an impact on all network components of the VLAN<br />2. the scope of a routed network failure is limited to the ports connected to the routed interface, while the scope of a bridged VLAN failure can impact all networking equipment in the entire bridging domain (entire data center, or multiple data centers in the case of stretched VLANs)<br />",

      "html": "I agree with Ivan almost everything in this post except how I see fail-open/close part but it is okay.<br />For the implicit enablement of bpdu-guard or BA , since they are opposite things, when bpdu-guard says if I see bpdu from here , I will not allowed and take an action , while BA expects bidirectional hello messages , for the switches where the uplink logic applies it might be enabled IMO. But in the data center it may not be an easy since server and switch places may change and when you enable bpdu-guard for the server implicitly, if same port would be changed with switch, port Stp expectation automatically should change as BA. Is this possible, maybe yes. Once switch port see the Ethernet source mac address , from the vendor assigned part of MAC address , switch could act based on it. You might say connected device might be belong to Cisco switch and server since many vendor has switches, servers, firewalls so on in the data center , then for the different product type vendor could assigned MAC addresses hierarchically such as 00-00-01 is our switches , 00-00-02 is servers so on.",

It&#39;s your fault for buying a switch which does not function as specified.",
