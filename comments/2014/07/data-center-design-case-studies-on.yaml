    html: Yeah, but they&#39;re harder to read (next to impossible on my old Kindle),
      as there&#39;s no text reflow. <br /><br />My PDFs are, however, optimized for
      iPad&#39;s screen (4:3 ratio, reasonable large text size).

  html: It&#39;s worth mentioning you can upload PDFs to Kindle.

  html: "Ivan, two things;<br /><br />1. You should be able to create an .epub version\
    \ of your book that you can sell along with the PDF without too much trouble.\
    \ This would be a boon for Kindle owners but avoid the need to use KDP. I&#39;ve\
    \ used Sigil without too much trouble.<br /><br />Based on the UK price of your\
    \ book of \xA318.13 you are making only \xA30.74 more by selling at this price\
    \ instead of \xA38 with a 70% royalty. I think your customers would rather not\
    \ be charged \xA310 more so you can make an extra 74p. I&#39;d suggest a volume\
    \ one and two approach would be preferable."

    html: Hi Brook,<br /><br />I have absolutely no problem with the sales channel
      taking 30%. I do have a problem with someone taking 65% because they disagree
      with my valuation of my work.<br /><br />As for &quot;Amazon versus traditional
      publishers&quot; - Amazon is charging 30% for access to their shelves, whereas
      the traditional publisher does way more work (been there, done that).<br /><br
      />Finally, I&#39;d appreciate any links you might have that would give me more
      insight into that centuries-old arguments.<br /><br />Thanks for your feedback!<br
      />Ivan

    html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Perhaps Amazon needs more competition so the prices
      come down?<br /><br />It&#39;s the debate that was held from the the enactment
      of the Articles of Conferation, 1776, unitl the Constitution of the USA was
      approved in Congress in 1787. <br /><br />The debate I referred to is about
      federal vs. state authority to govern in the USA.  When the 16th ammendment
      (circa WW 1) was ratified, it affirmed that the federal government could levy
      an income tax on any citizen it wished. The rest is history and has become an
      enormous mess IMHO. At one point the marginal tax rate was as high as 90% ...
      which makes Amazon&#39;s tithe for being an electronic book store look &quot;cheap&quot;.
      :-)  But that&#39;s not really any consolation, is it.<br /><br />I hope the
      summer has been pleasant in Ljubljana, my friend.  I enjoyed my brief stay there
      last June.<br /><br />Best.<br />Brook.

  html: Ivan,<br /><br />Not to defend Amazon per se, but you do realize you are able
    to self-publish a book and gain world wide access to buyers 24x7x365 via Amazon&#39;s
    infrastructure investment. Compare that to the cost, logistics and time you would
    have invested with a traditional &quot;dead tree&quot; publisher and I think there
    may well be &quot;value&quot; being added.<br /><br />As to the &quot;tax witholding&quot;
    for &quot;non-USA&quot; entities ... well, that gets into unsettled political
    arguments that are more than 225 years old and so I&#39;ll just move on. :-)<br
    /><br />Congrats on the book.
