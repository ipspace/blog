  html: "Technology has its legacies. Technology has a history. Technology makes history.\
    \ It\u2019s important to understand history to understand the kludges, as you\
    \ call them. It all began with the Yellow cable. The original, coaxial Yellow\
    \ cable is the first medium for IEEE 802.3, Ethernet. It\u2019s a shared medium.\
    \ Any station attached to the medium can communicate with each other. With stations\
    \ directly attached to a single, common medium no extra device, no layer-2 bridge\
    \ (switch) is needed for communication. Initially it was expected that each LAN\
    \ segment would have its own router to interconnect to another LAN segment. Radia\
    \ Perlman worked at DEC, the company that together with Intel and Xerox defined\
    \ the 10 Mb/s DIX standard. In http://www.networkworld.com/article/2202492/lan-wan/living-legends--radia-perlman--layer-3-wizard.html\
    \ Radia Perlman explains: \u201C\u2018Routing between links was Layer 3&#39;s\
    \ job. When I tried to argue that we may need to forward packets from one Ethernet\
    \ link to another, the reply was &#39;Our customers would never want to do that&#39;.\
    \ Their perception was Layer 3 was just unnecessary bytes on the wire.\u2019 But\
    \ it didn&#39;t take long for that shortsightedness to become obvious. Customers\
    \ did, after all, want to talk from one Ethernet to another.\u201D<br />So Radia\
    \ Perlman invented STP constrained by several requirements. For a station it should\
    \ not matter if it communicates to a station on the same LAN segment or via a\
    \ bridge to a station on another LAN segment. Since Ethernet has no TTL value,\
    \ however, frames could loop forever on a ring. Thus, STP needs to maintain the\
    \ illusion of a single shared medium. This is why STP builds a tree.<br />Later\
    \ on with the introduction of twisted pairs as the wired medium, Ethernet\u2019\
    s physical bus topology converged to a physical star topology requiring a central\
    \ hub that would create the illusion of a shared medium. After all a hub forwards\
    \ any incoming frames to all ports but the port a frame was received from. With\
    \ the introduction of learning bridges (switches) Ethernet could have transformed\
    \ into something even more powerful. However, with a huge installed basis compatibility\
    \ becomes a key issue and revolution turns into evolution.<br />We all know that\
    \ STP and large L2 domains have their (severe) limitations. However, without understanding\
    \ the past it\u2019s very easy to complain about how things have developed.<br\
    \ />One of the disadvantages of STP that you didn\u2019t mention is the waste\
    \ of capacity. Because of the tree structure redundant paths cannot be used. Thus,\
    \ frames might travel much farther than the physical topology would require. Shortest\
    \ Path Bridging (SPB, 802.1aq) solves all of (R/M)STP\u2019s problems boosting\
    \ Ethernet into another dimension. At its core SPB runs IS-IS \u2013 another protocol\
    \ invented by Radia Perlman \u2026<br />"

    html: Fail-Close like an electrical circuit. A closed circuit means it&#39;s a
      completed one and electrons pass. An open circuit is incomplete and as such
      electrons don&#39;t pass. Fail-Open would mean no traffic if forwarded until
      something closes the circuit.

    other things as well).  Too bad hardly anyone seems interested in implementing
    it, or anything else new outside of the data center...

  html: Let&#39;s imagine for a second that we create a networking containing Cisco
    devices only.<br /><br />Bridge Assurance works nice in a pure STP topology (802.1w
    and 802.1s only, 802.1d does not support BA) since it has blocked ports by definitions
    and these ports prohibit L2 loop creation. That&#39;s fine for a campus environment
    (if your hardware/software supports it as well :) )<br /><br />But in a pure DC
    environment where you deployed Nexus 5k/2k with the vPC feature, Cisco definitely
    does not recommend to enable Bridge Assurance other than on the vPC peer link.

    html: I&#39;ve always thought of STP as controlling a flood (broadcast), and a
      &quot;flood gate&quot; controls that. So a fail-open means the gate is open,
      allowing floods....

  html: Bridging with STP sure beats bridging *without* STP! :)<br /><br />The biggest
    problem with STP in my opinion is that it&#39;s a dangerous combination of &quot;just
    works&quot;, &quot;difficult to diagnose&quot; and &quot;somewhat fragile&quot;,
    making it easy to screw up in ways that are hard to understand while it&#39;s
    broken.<br /><br />There have been some wonderfully documented cases of folks
    who should know better pushing STP beyond its breaking point. The STP process
    didn&#39;t stop responding, but it couldn&#39;t do its job anymore.<br /><br />No
    mention of loopguard? It&#39;s a bit like bridge assurance (in one direction,
    anyway), and quite a bit more commonly available.<br /><br />Fail open/closed
    is clunky language that begets confusion. It&#39;s worse in the case of bump-in-the-wire
    devices with bypass relays, but the confusion has already appeared here in the
    comments.<br /><br />I tend to view the close/open question from the electrical
    (switch) perspective, but a quick google of &quot;ethernet tap fail open&quot;
    demonstrates that folks marketing and using network devices sometimes mean exactly
    the opposite.

  html: "I have used this quote from a Cisco doc in my attempts to get people to understand\
    \ this concept. From a \u201CCisco Validated Design\u201D document entitled \u201C\
    Data Center Design \u2013 IP Network Infrastructure\u201D (pps 35-36, October\
    \ 8, 2009):<br /><br />\u201CTransparent bridging is the result of a long technological\
    \ evolution that was guided by the desire to keep the property of the thick coaxial\
    \ cable that was the base for the original Ethernet networks. Transparent means\
    \ that the stations using the service are not aware that the traffic they are\
    \ sending is bridged; they are not participating in the bridging effort. The technology\
    \ is similarly transparent to the user, and a high end Ethernet switch running\
    \ STP is still supposed to be plug-and-play, just like a coaxial cable or a repeater\
    \ were. As a result, unlike routers, bridges have to discover whether their ports\
    \ are connected to peer bridges or plain hosts. In particular, in the absence\
    \ of control message reception on a port, a bridge will assume that it is connected\
    \ to a host and will provide connectivity. Therefore, the most significant differences\
    \ between routing and bridging with STP (spanning tree protocol) are as follows:<br\
    \ />\u2022 A routing protocol identifies where to send packets.<br />\u2022 STP\
    \ identifies where not to send frames.<br />The obvious consequence is that if\
    \ a router fails to receive the appropriate updates, the parts of the network\
    \ that were relying on this router for communication will not be able to reach\
    \ each other. This failure tends to be local, as the communication within those\
    \ distant network parts is not affected. If a bridge misses control information,\
    \ it will instead open a loop. As it has been observed, this will most likely\
    \ impact the whole bridging domain.\u201D<br /><br />I summarize this using language\
    \ that aligns with network security discussions, in which &quot;fail closed&quot;\
    \ is a safe failure condition vs &quot;fail open&quot;:<br /><br />&quot;To summarize\
    \ the two major points being made in the quote from Cisco:<br />1. a routed interface\
    \ will \u201Cfail closed\u201D with no impact on any other routed interfaces,\
    \ while a set of transparently bridged ports defined as a single virtual LAN will\
    \ \u201Cfail open\u201D with an impact on all network components of the VLAN<br\
    \ />2. the scope of a routed network failure is limited to the ports connected\
    \ to the routed interface, while the scope of a bridged VLAN failure can impact\
    \ all networking equipment in the entire bridging domain (entire data center,\
    \ or multiple data centers in the case of stretched VLANs)<br />"

    html: You might have to configure a switch port to be an edge or a fabric port
      - too much plug-and-pray is never a good thing (although you could use LLDP
      to figure out which ports are fabric ports).<br /><br />OTOH, if you don&#39;t
      know whether another switch or a server is connected to a port of a DC switch,
      you might have bigger problems than STP on your hands ;)

  html: I agree with Ivan almost everything in this post except how I see fail-open/close
    part but it is okay.<br />For the implicit enablement of bpdu-guard or BA , since
    they are opposite things, when bpdu-guard says if I see bpdu from here , I will
    not allowed and take an action , while BA expects bidirectional hello messages
    , for the switches where the uplink logic applies it might be enabled IMO. But
    in the data center it may not be an easy since server and switch places may change
    and when you enable bpdu-guard for the server implicitly, if same port would be
    changed with switch, port Stp expectation automatically should change as BA. Is
    this possible, maybe yes. Once switch port see the Ethernet source mac address
    , from the vendor assigned part of MAC address , switch could act based on it.
    You might say connected device might be belong to Cisco switch and server since
    many vendor has switches, servers, firewalls so on in the data center , then for
    the different product type vendor could assigned MAC addresses hierarchically
    such as 00-00-01 is our switches , 00-00-02 is servers so on.

  html: "&quot;That\u2019s all nice and dandy until a bridge loses its mind, and stops\
    \ sending BPDUs (control plane activity) while still forwarding traffic (data\
    \ plane activity). Adjacent bridges think they have hosts plugged into the affected\
    \ ports (this is the fail close part), and start forwarding traffic through those\
    \ ports, resulting in a nice forwarding loop (been there, seen that).&quot;<br\
    \ /><br />If a bridge loses its mind??<br /><br />You are in essence saying you\
    \ need a configuration variable (such as &quot;bridge assurance&quot;) to make\
    \ a switch stop forwarding traffic in case it, or an adjacent switch, has a buggy\
    \ control plane implementation!<br /><br />A better rule might be, just buy well-tested\
    \ switches.<br /><br />A correctly implemented bridge/switch must guarantee that\
    \ it processes spanning tree with the highest level of priority, and treats send/receive\
    \ BPDUs on the network with the highest level of priority.<br /><br />Sorry, but\
    \ once you implement a control plane protocol in a buggy manner, all bets are\
    \ off. It&#39;s your fault for buying a switch which does not function as specified."

    html: The point is that you cannot expect the BPDUs to be flooded across a hung
      bridge because the HW punts them to the hung CPU, so adjacent bridges cannot
      discover the loop.

  html: Hello Ivan,<br /><br />You have mentioned the comment &quot;because the forwarding
    entry for the STP multicast address still punts packets to the CPU&quot;.<br /><br
    />Can you elucidate a bit please?<br />If I am mistaken not a BPDU being punted
    to CPU is still processed (though any PDU will be punted to CPU irrespective the
    platform).<br /><br />What&#39;s the correlation you are tying to make here?<br
    /><br />By the way, your blog is like a new Network Engineer born out of silos.<br
    /><br />Sincerely,<br />Saeed Ansari
