  html: Also remember that distributed vSwitch is the boundary for vMotion. So even
    if you stretch L2 with VXLAN between two different vSwitches you will not be able
    to vMotion the VM. It is current vCenter Server limitation.

  html: 'How do we by pass the limitation of VMware which states that vmkernel interfaces
    of vMotion should be in same L2 segment. If we put this vmkernel interface behind
    VXLAN port-group it will be bit odd setup as you have traffic initiated from VMkernel
    gets encapsulated by another vmkernel interface. '

  html: VMotion is just moving a bunch of data between hypervisor kernels. Does it
    matter if the connectivity is L2 or L3, though VMW best practices suggests to
    have a separate Infra-VLAN for VMotions.<br /><br />What is the problem running
    VMotion over L3 ?. Will it interfere with data traffic ?. One can always use QoS
    to handle such a scenario.
