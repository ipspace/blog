      "html": "Ivan,<br /><br />I am not fully convinced with basic assumption of &quot;We quickly agreed physical-to-virtual gateways are the primary use case&quot;. Would rather look at the problem from controller&#39;s scalabilty and performance point of view. That is where would one deploy VTEPs, is it on hypervisors or or on ToR&#39;s.<br /><br />Consider a different usecase with 50K VM&#39;s, at 60VM&#39;s per physical host ~825+ physical hosts (all virtualized). Assuming 5 VM&#39;s per VNI, about 10K&#39;s VNI&#39;s and each VM&#39;s of a given tenant reside in different physical host. <br /><br />If one were to have VTEPs at the hyper-visors for the usecase considered. The performance numbers are as follows<br /><br />1) 2 TCP connection with each hyper visors. One for OVSDB and another for OF (With NSX or with ODL). So the controller has to handle about 1500+ TCP connections just for managing the hypervisors.<br /><br />2) If OF-1.0 is used, #virtual ports created on a single physical host are 60 * 5 = 300/physical host. So the controller to handle 300 * 825 ~ 25K virtual ports. Agree this number is reduced when OF1.3 is used. At this don&#39;t have numbers to what extent.<br /><br />3) #flows programmed by the controller also increases as flows are programmed by the controller.<br /><br />4) Controller to manage 825+ physical hosts to distribute VM routes.<br /><br />On the other hand, if the VTEPs are deployed at ToR switch, with 30 10GE Ports<br /><br />A) #TCP connection to controller is 25+. We only need OVSDB connection and don&#39;t require OF, as solution like NSX leave the programming of flows to HW vendor instead of using OF.<br /><br />B) As there is no OF in the picture, controller need not bother about creating virtual-ports/handling flow entries etc. <br /><br />C) Controller to manage only 25+ HW VTEPs to distribute VM routes.<br /><br />So, to summarize scalability of the controller becomes important point for choosing hardware VxLAN GWs<br />",
