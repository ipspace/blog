      "html": "Certainly a good reminder that evangelists often make the worst predictors =)<br /><br />That said, you could at least make the case the a lot more of the SDN bullet point have existing technologies you can buy today that implement them, such as Tail-f and Control for better orchestration or openflow for granular control.  We&#39;re still a few years from figuring out how these bits and pieces will all plus together in a big picture, but there&#39;s a *lot* more room for incremental benefit in SDN than the giant monolith of IPv6.<br /><br />Now I&#39;m just waiting for more vendors to figure out that their SDN components could have some real value in the campus edge, not just the backbone and DC....",

      "html": "Great points. When I think about IPv6 and SDN, I certainly can see similarities. However, I believe there is potential for SDN concepts to be adopted more aggressively than the IPv6 protocol. When we think about SDN, businesses can realize the benefits immediately. Moreover, it can be implemented in constrained areas with connectivity to traditional networks through traditional mechanisms. <br /><br />When that is compared, IPv6 is another Internet protocol with additional overhead (technically and operationally). Admittedly, IPv6 needs to happen. Unfortunately, our lives just get a more complex. That complexity will lessen as IPv4 can be relegated. But that will be a long, long time.",
