            <div class="comment-content">Hello! <br />One important thing should be mentioned is that HP devices in SPB or TRILL mode cannot route traffic. In design you have to make additional devices for routing between VLANs. In one of my project I had to refuse from using either of these technologies. Another thing that I do not like in HP solution is that they do not have anycast FHRP. Extended protocol of VRRP is almost like GLBP works, you have different MAC addreses for different VRRP gateways. <br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">HP is working on a solution for the Layer2/Layer3 offload that alleviates the requirement for a separate L3 box.<br />In terms of solutions offerings, HP offers SPB and TRILL according to the IETF and IEEE standards. I don&#39;t see a problem in terms of which platform supports which protocol, they support it. If you want SPB, go for the 12500, if you want TRILL go for the 12900.<br />As for Anycast VRRP, HP solutions support VRRPe which allows for load balancing. And there is an even better solution which is IRF which is a consistent stacking technology throughout the whole HP Comware product portfolio.<br /><br />With regards to SPB support, any switch that supports QinQ (MacinMac) can potentially support SPB. This is the case for the 11900 and 12900. Whether it is going to be supported is dependent on customer requirements. Because code is unified (Comware 7) it is not a big deal to build the features into other platforms.<br /><br />Rest assure that HP has a complete and compelling product and solution portfolio with a huge range of functionality, protocol support and features.<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">Dear Anonymous,<br /><br />First of all, thanks for confirming that there really is L2-only limitation in HP&#39;s SPB/TRILL deployments.<br /><br />As for VRRP in IRF, we both know that IRF has the same limitations as any other shared-control-plane architecture, and supports limited number of core bridges in an IRF cluster.<br /><br />Finally, based on your last paragraph, I would guess that you work for HP or one of its partners, in which case it would be fair to everyone else to disclose it.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Ivan</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br /><br />With regards to Ales&#39; response, the reason for the limitation is the chipset (Trident II), so all vendors that use this chipset have the same issue. The main reason for this limitation is that an incoming packet can be processed once by the ASIC. This means that if TRILL encapsulation has to take place, the TRILL encapsulated packet leaves the ASIC and L3 cannot be done anymore by that ASIC. Some vendors solve this by sacrificing other ASICs or doing traffic redirection or physical loopbacks. At this moment this is also HP&#39;s solution. As said, HP is working on another solution that alleviates these requirements and you can run L2/L3 within the fabric on the standard hardware. The solution will most likely be a software upgrade only.<br /><br />WIth IRF you can already build some pretty high density cores. For example, on the 12518 you can build a 4 switch IRF providing 4 x 18 x 48 = 3456 10 Gbps ports (subtract some for IRF). Although IRF does have a master/slave relationship for the control plane, each Management module is fully synchronized with the master, so if the master fails there is an instant failover. In addition to that, IRF is a fully distributed L3 architecture, so each device in the IRF takes care of its own routing on the ASIC. So, I would not compare IRF with any other shared control plane architecture like VPC or VSS.<br />The other good thing is that you can still combine IRF with fabric technologies like SPB or TRILL. And that allows you to create huge fabrics consisting of different IRF&#39;s.<br /><br />And yes, I work for HP. This means that I cannot share all information but in general I can say that if there is a demand for specific functionality HP can build it. I think the main question is whether there is actually a need for all these fabric technologies in the Datacenter. I can imagine that in some situations there is but we should not consider these technologies as the holy grail and deploy it just for the sake of it.<br /><br />It&#39;s all about listening to what the customer really needs. I know this is a cliche but unfortunately, I see this happening with customers all the time (making things overcomplicated).<br /><br />Just my 2 cents.<br /><br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi There,<br /><br />To my understanding the limitation is that a port can either be a TRILL port without IP routing or a routed port without TRILL. This limitation shall be common to all other vendors (i.e. Cisco Nexus 5672-UP) relying on Broadcom&#39;s Trident II chipset in their boxes. HP seem to be able to do routing via loopback interface(s), but it may not be the recommended way. The recommendation is to use a routing leaf/ToR.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">there are vendors that can support L3 forwarding thanks to another virtual context, so the TRILL context does TRILL/SPB, L3 forwarding/routing and so on is done by another context, and contexts are connected via physical cables. the same vendor can provide 16 contexts in the same chassis, and build 4-switches clusters spreading the virtual context across the 4 chasiss.  </div>

            <div class="comment-content">I stopped tracking what HP does on their data center switches the moment they decided to start reselling Arista switches (not to mention that even five years ago HP mostly rebranded H3C stuff as their own). The real challenge to do what you mentioned is called RIOT (Routing In and Out of the Tunnel), and it doesn&#39;t matter whether the tunnel is VXLAN- or TRILL-encapsulated.<br /><br />Not sure what Broadcom can do on TRILL today (recent chipsets can do RIOT with VXLAN), but the original 5900 definitely couldn&#39;t do it.</div>

The IRF fabric receives these packets and uses TRILL to forward these packets.<br />.. These packets need to be forwarded through both a TRILL trunk port and a TRILL access port.<br />As a result, the total rate of these TRILL packets cannot exceed half the bandwidth of the IRF port.<br />• These packets processed by TRILL must be processed by the internal loopback interface. As a result, the total<br />rate of these packets cannot exceed the bandwidth of the internal loopback interface.<br />Limited by the two resources above, the forwarding capabilities of TRILL for these packets are as follows:<br />• On S5820V2-52QF and S5820V2-52Q switches, the total rate of these packets cannot exceed 4 Gbps.<br />• On S5830V2-24S and S5820V2-54QS-GE switches, the total rate of these packets cannot exceed 8 Gbps.&quot;</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The HP reps I talk to push for SPB  rather than trill, which seems to contradict your observation on this subject. <br /><br />It seems that Avaya is the only vendor that does L2 and L3 on their SPB switches. But they have a proprietary -  excuse me: pre-standard - approach. How would you rate Avaya in comparison to HP? </div>

            <div class="comment-content">While i was implementing SPB on several 5900&#39;s i also encountered this routing issue. I had to place extra switches on several sites but some sites did not require L3 routing. The only problem i was facing there that i was unable to manage my switches remote using SSH. (could also be named a routing issue)<br /><br />HP reps told me before the project to use SPB so they are indeed recommending it.</div>
