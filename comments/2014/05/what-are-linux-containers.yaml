  html: Yes, I&#39;m amazed old technologies are made to look new and novel by the
    mainstream tech media.<br />I remember more than 10 years ago I used to have servers
    hosted with SWSoft&#39;s VPS which also uses OS-level virtualisation.<br />Before
    we know it, it&#39;s all back to square one using a shared DLLs on single instance
    of OS on physical hardware - how ironic would that be?

  html: I&#39;ve used all the common container methods in Linux for many years now
    (vserver, openvz, lxc) and you are right - they&#39;ve been around for years,
    but even as a seasoned Linux admin, LXC is terribly difficulty to work with.  The
    reason it&#39;s all the rage now is because somebody (the Docker.io project) abstracted
    away a lot of the rough-edges of LXC and made it consumable for mere mortals.<br
    /><br />Because of some of the features it brings to the table (notably union
    filesystems against base images), developers can reliably re-create the same environments
    consistently, and it provides a very easy way to share images with others.<br
    /><br />Another reason LXC is being more broadly adopted is one of it&#39;s long-standing
    issues is now resolved (user-name space separation).  root in container is no
    longer equivalent to root on the host-node.

  html: '@Chris Bennett: +1. This container renaissance is all about user experience.
    Docker has a lot of refinements in its design.'
