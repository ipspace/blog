      "html": "The definition of Head-of-Line Blocking implicit in this post seems to be different from the one that I am familiar with.  I\u2019ve mainly seen Head-of-Line blocking used to refer to a situation where a downstream resource is left underutilized and unable to perform needed work, because of congestion of an otherwise independent resource.<br /><br />For example, input ports 1 and 2 are both sending traffic to output port 8 of a switch.  The sum of the traffic coming from 1&amp;2 is greater than the capacity of port 8, so port 8 becomes oversubscribed.  Ports 1&amp;2 can\u2019t send all the traffic that they want to port 8 across the fabric.  So traffic backs up in the input queues of ports 1 &amp; 2.   <br /><br />However, in addition to having traffic destined to output port 8, port 2 also receives traffic destined to output port 5.  Output port 5 is unutilized, and is ready and waiting to accept traffic from port 2.  But the traffic that port 2 has for output port 5 is sitting in port 2\u2019s input queue.  It can\u2019t get to output port 5 until the traffic queued to output port 8 is cleared.  So output port 5 continues to sit idle, even though the switch has traffic for it.  <br /><br />In this post, head-of-line blocking is used in the context of one application flow causing congestion that impacts another application flow.  This is not necessarily head-of-line blocking, in the context of the description given just above, because it does not necessarily result in any un(der)utilized downstream resources.  For all we know, the file transfer and the request response protocol could utilize the same downstream path, including the same destination server resources.  In this case, you might get a better overall user experience using Weighted Fair Queuing, etc. to separate the file transfer from the request/response transaction.    But it wouldn\u2019t be head-of-line blocking, at least not by the definition of head-of-line blocking that I\u2019m familiar with.<br /><br />Along these lines, VoQ\u2019s are typically created to be per-output port, so that traffic destined to different output ports go into different VoQ\u2019s.  In many cases  queues may be both per-traffic class and per-output port, so that traffic can be differentiated in both dimensions.  But with per-output port VoQ\u2019s it would not generally be true that \u201cVirtual output queues \u2026 cannot solve HoL blocking problems between flows of the same traffic\u201d.  It would only be true of flows of the same traffic class destined to the same output port.<br /><br />If my understanding of head-of-line blocking is not what you believe matches common usage, by all means please correct me.<br />",
