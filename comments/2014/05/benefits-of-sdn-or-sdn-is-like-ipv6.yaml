    html: Well, the only point where I&#39;d agree there&#39;s some meat today is
      &quot;NFV and Service Chaining&quot; and there&#39;s potential for &quot;DevOps
      friendly architecture&quot;.

  html: Certainly a good reminder that evangelists often make the worst predictors
    =)<br /><br />That said, you could at least make the case the a lot more of the
    SDN bullet point have existing technologies you can buy today that implement them,
    such as Tail-f and Control for better orchestration or openflow for granular control.  We&#39;re
    still a few years from figuring out how these bits and pieces will all plus together
    in a big picture, but there&#39;s a *lot* more room for incremental benefit in
    SDN than the giant monolith of IPv6.<br /><br />Now I&#39;m just waiting for more
    vendors to figure out that their SDN components could have some real value in
    the campus edge, not just the backbone and DC....

    html: IPv6 also started as a concept and a grand unifying theory of everything
      ... and all that&#39;s left are a bunch of draft standards (it&#39;s not a single
      standard, and it&#39;s not, strictly speaking, a standard at all).

  html: One big difference, IPv6 is a standard whereas SDN is a concept.

  html: 'Interesting comparison. <br /><br />Do you expect SDN to follow IPv6 way
    ?. People will keep taking about benefits of SDN but will take longer time to
    implement ? '

  html: Great points. When I think about IPv6 and SDN, I certainly can see similarities.
    However, I believe there is potential for SDN concepts to be adopted more aggressively
    than the IPv6 protocol. When we think about SDN, businesses can realize the benefits
    immediately. Moreover, it can be implemented in constrained areas with connectivity
    to traditional networks through traditional mechanisms. <br /><br />When that
    is compared, IPv6 is another Internet protocol with additional overhead (technically
    and operationally). Admittedly, IPv6 needs to happen. Unfortunately, our lives
    just get a more complex. That complexity will lessen as IPv4 can be relegated.
    But that will be a long, long time.
