  html: OpenFlow does not make sense. The L2 and most L3 functions of switching need
    not be centrally processed at line rate. This also doesn&#39;t align with need
    or demand. <br /><br />NFV makes much more sense in conjunction with programmatic
    switch control. I would be very happy if a network vendor would build a management
    platform to which all switches could be registered and managed with a graphical
    and programmatic interface. <br /><br />Open the UI, create a data flow with VLAN,
    route, and QOS parameters and click go. The management platform issues the commands
    to the switches to configure them to support the designed flow. The management
    platform then tests the flow and provides notification that it has been successful.
    Of course, the management platform also monitors and reports on switch performance/activity.<br
    /><br />This management platform can then be integrated with hypervisors to allow
    provisioning of workloads and networks through the same wizard. The network doesn&#39;t
    need to be intelligent, it needs to be obedient.

    html: At what speeds and aggregate bandwidth? And don&#39;t forget that in most
      cases all the traffic gets hauled back to the controller. See also<br /><br

  html: Of course, enterprise wireless networks have a centralized controller and
    can support thousands of access points.

  html: Does not a big chassis has similar construct of centralized controller model
    that you talk about here ?. RP is the centralized controller and the line-cards
    are dumb switches programmed by the RP ?

    html: Not one but atleast two for redundancy purpose where each chassis would
      typically have 2 RPM&#39;s (Primary &amp; Standby) and both chassis talk to
      each other using some protocols (federation) or using vPC . Similarly mechanisms
      can be applied to centralized Openflow model as well right ?. One could have
      2 or more controllers in their network, each controller supports HA and throw
      in federation among the controllers.<br /><br />My point out here is that SPOF
      &amp; Network partitioning for centralized controller model could be solved
      by borrowing ideas from chassis world.<br />

  html: You&#39;re absolutely right. And how many networks have you seen built with
    a single big chassis?
