In design you have to make additional devices for routing between VLANs. In one of my project I had to refuse from using either of these technologies. Another thing that I do not like in HP solution is that they do not have anycast FHRP. Extended protocol of VRRP is almost like GLBP works, you have different MAC addreses for different VRRP gateways. <br />",

I don&#39;t see a problem in terms of which platform supports which protocol, they support it. If you want SPB, go for the 12500, if you want TRILL go for the 12900.<br />As for Anycast VRRP, HP solutions support VRRPe which allows for load balancing. And there is an even better solution which is IRF which is a consistent stacking technology throughout the whole HP Comware product portfolio.<br /><br />With regards to SPB support, any switch that supports QinQ (MacinMac) can potentially support SPB. This is the case for the 11900 and 12900. Whether it is going to be supported is dependent on customer requirements. Because code is unified (Comware 7) it is not a big deal to build the features into other platforms.<br /><br />Rest assure that HP has a complete and compelling product and solution portfolio with a huge range of functionality, protocol support and features.<br />",

          "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />With regards to Ales&#39; response, the reason for the limitation is the chipset (Trident II), so all vendors that use this chipset have the same issue. The main reason for this limitation is that an incoming packet can be processed once by the ASIC. This means that if TRILL encapsulation has to take place, the TRILL encapsulated packet leaves the ASIC and L3 cannot be done anymore by that ASIC. Some vendors solve this by sacrificing other ASICs or doing traffic redirection or physical loopbacks. At this moment this is also HP&#39;s solution. As said, HP is working on another solution that alleviates these requirements and you can run L2/L3 within the fabric on the standard hardware. The solution will most likely be a software upgrade only.<br /><br />WIth IRF you can already build some pretty high density cores. For example, on the 12518 you can build a 4 switch IRF providing 4 x 18 x 48 = 3456 10 Gbps ports (subtract some for IRF). Although IRF does have a master/slave relationship for the control plane, each Management module is fully synchronized with the master, so if the master fails there is an instant failover. In addition to that, IRF is a fully distributed L3 architecture, so each device in the IRF takes care of its own routing on the ASIC. So, I would not compare IRF with any other shared control plane architecture like VPC or VSS.<br />The other good thing is that you can still combine IRF with fabric technologies like SPB or TRILL. And that allows you to create huge fabrics consisting of different IRF&#39;s.<br /><br />And yes, I work for HP. This means that I cannot share all information but in general I can say that if there is a demand for specific functionality HP can build it. I think the main question is whether there is actually a need for all these fabric technologies in the Datacenter. I can imagine that in some situations there is but we should not consider these technologies as the holy grail and deploy it just for the sake of it.<br /><br />It&#39;s all about listening to what the customer really needs. I know this is a cliche but unfortunately, I see this happening with customers all the time (making things overcomplicated).<br /><br />Just my 2 cents.<br /><br />",
