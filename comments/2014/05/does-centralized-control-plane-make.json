      "html": "OpenFlow does not make sense. The L2 and most L3 functions of switching need not be centrally processed at line rate. This also doesn&#39;t align with need or demand. <br /><br />NFV makes much more sense in conjunction with programmatic switch control. I would be very happy if a network vendor would build a management platform to which all switches could be registered and managed with a graphical and programmatic interface. <br /><br />Open the UI, create a data flow with VLAN, route, and QOS parameters and click go. The management platform issues the commands to the switches to configure them to support the designed flow. The management platform then tests the flow and provides notification that it has been successful. Of course, the management platform also monitors and reports on switch performance/activity.<br /><br />This management platform can then be integrated with hypervisors to allow provisioning of workloads and networks through the same wizard. The network doesn&#39;t need to be intelligent, it needs to be obedient.",

          "html": "Not one but atleast two for redundancy purpose where each chassis would typically have 2 RPM&#39;s (Primary &amp; Standby) and both chassis talk to each other using some protocols (federation) or using vPC . Similarly mechanisms can be applied to centralized Openflow model as well right ?. One could have 2 or more controllers in their network, each controller supports HA and throw in federation among the controllers.<br /><br />My point out here is that SPOF &amp; Network partitioning for centralized controller model could be solved by borrowing ideas from chassis world.<br />",
