      "html": "I&#39;ve used all the common container methods in Linux for many years now (vserver, openvz, lxc) and you are right - they&#39;ve been around for years, but even as a seasoned Linux admin, LXC is terribly difficulty to work with.  The reason it&#39;s all the rage now is because somebody (the Docker.io project) abstracted away a lot of the rough-edges of LXC and made it consumable for mere mortals.<br /><br />Because of some of the features it brings to the table (notably union filesystems against base images), developers can reliably re-create the same environments consistently, and it provides a very easy way to share images with others.<br /><br />Another reason LXC is being more broadly adopted is one of it&#39;s long-standing issues is now resolved (user-name space separation).  root in container is no longer equivalent to root on the host-node.",
