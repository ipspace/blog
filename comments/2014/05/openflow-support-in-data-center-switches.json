      "html": "Hi Ivan, good summary. But it seems you missed one important SDN switch player, CentecNetwors.<br />it has its own switch silicon. In all the ASIC powered openflow switch, maybe Centec&#39;s is a little<br />outstanding comparably.  It can support 32K 5-tuple L3/L4 flows or 32K 5-tuple L2 flows.<br />Also it can rewrite ipda/ipsa/L4DstPort/L4SrcPort in addition to rewriting other fields.<br />You can visit http://www.centecnetworks.com/en/Main.asp for more info. Sorry for the Ad post.<br />Just want to provide you some info in case you are not aware.",
