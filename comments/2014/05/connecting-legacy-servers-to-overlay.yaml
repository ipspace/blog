  html: I have an idea.....  don&#39;t worry about connecting legacy servers to overlay
    networks in the datacenter.<br /><br />Wait until the next hardware refresh and
    virtualize all legacy servers,  using VLANs temporarily before starting the deployment
    of the overlay networks.<br /><br />
