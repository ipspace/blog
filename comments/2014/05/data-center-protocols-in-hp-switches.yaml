    html: Sort-of makes sense. Would you know whether this is documented anywhere?
      I found nothing in the 5900 TRILL/SPB manuals.

  html: Hello! <br />One important thing should be mentioned is that HP devices in
    SPB or TRILL mode cannot route traffic. In design you have to make additional
    devices for routing between VLANs. In one of my project I had to refuse from using
    either of these technologies. Another thing that I do not like in HP solution
    is that they do not have anycast FHRP. Extended protocol of VRRP is almost like
    GLBP works, you have different MAC addreses for different VRRP gateways. <br />

    html: HP is working on a solution for the Layer2/Layer3 offload that alleviates
      the requirement for a separate L3 box.<br />In terms of solutions offerings,
      HP offers SPB and TRILL according to the IETF and IEEE standards. I don&#39;t
      see a problem in terms of which platform supports which protocol, they support
      it. If you want SPB, go for the 12500, if you want TRILL go for the 12900.<br
      />As for Anycast VRRP, HP solutions support VRRPe which allows for load balancing.
      And there is an even better solution which is IRF which is a consistent stacking
      technology throughout the whole HP Comware product portfolio.<br /><br />With
      regards to SPB support, any switch that supports QinQ (MacinMac) can potentially
      support SPB. This is the case for the 11900 and 12900. Whether it is going to
      be supported is dependent on customer requirements. Because code is unified
      (Comware 7) it is not a big deal to build the features into other platforms.<br
      /><br />Rest assure that HP has a complete and compelling product and solution
      portfolio with a huge range of functionality, protocol support and features.<br
      />

    html: Dear Anonymous,<br /><br />First of all, thanks for confirming that there
      really is L2-only limitation in HP&#39;s SPB/TRILL deployments.<br /><br />As
      for VRRP in IRF, we both know that IRF has the same limitations as any other
      shared-control-plane architecture, and supports limited number of core bridges
      in an IRF cluster.<br /><br />Finally, based on your last paragraph, I would
      guess that you work for HP or one of its partners, in which case it would be
      fair to everyone else to disclose it.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Ivan

    html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />With regards to Ales&#39; response, the reason for the
      limitation is the chipset (Trident II), so all vendors that use this chipset
      have the same issue. The main reason for this limitation is that an incoming
      packet can be processed once by the ASIC. This means that if TRILL encapsulation
      has to take place, the TRILL encapsulated packet leaves the ASIC and L3 cannot
      be done anymore by that ASIC. Some vendors solve this by sacrificing other ASICs
      or doing traffic redirection or physical loopbacks. At this moment this is also
      HP&#39;s solution. As said, HP is working on another solution that alleviates
      these requirements and you can run L2/L3 within the fabric on the standard hardware.
      The solution will most likely be a software upgrade only.<br /><br />WIth IRF
      you can already build some pretty high density cores. For example, on the 12518
      you can build a 4 switch IRF providing 4 x 18 x 48 = 3456 10 Gbps ports (subtract
      some for IRF). Although IRF does have a master/slave relationship for the control
      plane, each Management module is fully synchronized with the master, so if the
      master fails there is an instant failover. In addition to that, IRF is a fully
      distributed L3 architecture, so each device in the IRF takes care of its own
      routing on the ASIC. So, I would not compare IRF with any other shared control
      plane architecture like VPC or VSS.<br />The other good thing is that you can
      still combine IRF with fabric technologies like SPB or TRILL. And that allows
      you to create huge fabrics consisting of different IRF&#39;s.<br /><br />And
      yes, I work for HP. This means that I cannot share all information but in general
      I can say that if there is a demand for specific functionality HP can build
      it. I think the main question is whether there is actually a need for all these
      fabric technologies in the Datacenter. I can imagine that in some situations
      there is but we should not consider these technologies as the holy grail and
      deploy it just for the sake of it.<br /><br />It&#39;s all about listening to
      what the customer really needs. I know this is a cliche but unfortunately, I
      see this happening with customers all the time (making things overcomplicated).<br
      /><br />Just my 2 cents.<br /><br />

  html: Hi There,<br /><br />To my understanding the limitation is that a port can
    either be a TRILL port without IP routing or a routed port without TRILL. This
    limitation shall be common to all other vendors (i.e. Cisco Nexus 5672-UP) relying
    on Broadcom&#39;s Trident II chipset in their boxes. HP seem to be able to do
    routing via loopback interface(s), but it may not be the recommended way. The
    recommendation is to use a routing leaf/ToR.

    html: Cisco calls this VDC, HP calls this MDC. You still need to have a different
      box (albeit virtual) do Layer 3. So the L3 handoff can be &quot;solved&quot;
      by doing this.<br />Wouldn&#39;t it be great that a leaf switch can decide at
      ingress whether a packet is a L2 (TRILL) or L3 packet?

    html: I stopped tracking what HP does on their data center switches the moment
      they decided to start reselling Arista switches (not to mention that even five
      years ago HP mostly rebranded H3C stuff as their own). The real challenge to
      do what you mentioned is called RIOT (Routing In and Out of the Tunnel), and
      it doesn&#39;t matter whether the tunnel is VXLAN- or TRILL-encapsulated.<br
      /><br />Not sure what Broadcom can do on TRILL today (recent chipsets can do
      RIOT with VXLAN), but the original 5900 definitely couldn&#39;t do it.
