            <div class="comment-content">Ah, a subject close to my heart. Load balancing isn&#39;t for the server guys now is it? And we all know how conservative those network guys are. <br /><br />In all seriousness, this really is a matter of fear of the unknown and an unwillingness to learn about the possibilities and then trust them in production. I hope this changes as network engineers are further exposed to both Linux and virtual appliances in general.<br /><br />Other products you could add to your list are;<br /><br />* Zen Load Balancer<br />* Balance<br />* Pound</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan.<br /><br />I don´t agree 100% ...  Here in denmark, nginx and haproxy is used ALOT.<br /><br />So the company i work in we do shared hosting apache,iis etc. All of our competitors also use some sort of opensource load balancing ( mostly nginx )<br /><br />We try to not use netscaler, f5 etc. Because of price but also creating a dedicated hardware/vm loadbalancer moves configuration away from the APP people to the network people :)<br />Trust me the APP people way! better at load balancing their own APP.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I personally do favor both IPVS and nginx, but both in their respective fields and taking their respective strengths and weaknesses into account.<br /><br />Commercial load balancers also often just don&#39;t offer exactly what&#39;s needed. For example, we&#39;re running loadbalancers who do perform highlevel backend availability checks and accordingly announce (or withdraw) a specific route for internal anycasted IP addresses. By installing those systems in multiple data centers, this results in a very high availability and low-latency. At worst, a failed service in one DC is automatically provided by the same service from a different DC - at some additional latency, but still accessible.<br />Most commercial loadbalancers in such a situation simply would like to pretend to be a DNS server and reply with low-TTL DNS-RRs - which consistently fails with Java applications (who ignored DNS-TTLs for years now), let alone give no solution if the service you&#39;re trying to load balance is your DNS service.<br /><br />Please also don&#39;t forget about IPVS: Linux IP Virtual Server does look more like &quot;typical&quot; L2/L3-level load balancers and uses techniques like direct server return (&quot;gatewaying&quot; or &quot;direct routing&quot; in IPVS lingo). A smallish box with a 100 Mbit network connection can easily handle Gbits of traffic with dozens of backend servers - as any outgoing traffic (replies) doesn&#39;t pass the loadbalancer at all.<br /><br />Proxy-based systems like nginx and haproxy are also very capable in terms of accepting thousands of connections in parallel, which may give you some relief if you&#39;re accustomed to an web servers who are easily taken by slowloris-attacks. nginx/haproxy do also terminate and create new backend connections, making them extremely flexible on your network: your backend servers cound be anywhere, there are no restrictions Have your balancer on your network, some backend nodes on AWS, some backend nodes in a colo somewhere around your corner, it doesn&#39;t matter (ignoring latency). Nginx/haproxy also do offer tons of L7-features which may result in a more complex configuration, but a very high benefit on the actual application. For example, static content could be served from a specifically tuned backend farm, while dynamic content is served by a different farm.<br />However, doing so does have impact on deployment and where or how to debug errors. If operations and development are a close team and share their knowledge, such setups do work out fine - otherwise, it may be hard to draw a line where and how some issue is going to be addressed. And some implementation and design issues do open up new questions.<br /><br />Most interesting projects are where multiple balancing solutions needed to be united: proxy-based systems couldn&#39;t handle the bandwidth, packet-based systems couldn&#39;t deliver the needed features. Trying to to that with a commercial load balancer can be a task of its own.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">(At the risk of necroposting...)<br /><br />The place I currently work in would likely count as an &quot;open source shop&quot; but sends the bulk of its traffic through a commercial load balancer.  However, most of the *new* traffic on the network is going through HAProxy.  New *clients* get HAProxy installed on them - the servers run health checks locally that write status to ZooKeeper, the clients discover what services are available by reading from ZooKeeper and configure HAProxy; they then connect to HAProxy on localhost to reach the servers.<br /><br />HAProxy also has the advantage of better health checks for PostgreSQL than our commercial load balancer, but that&#39;s an aside.</div>
