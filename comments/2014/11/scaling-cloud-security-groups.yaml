  html: We are using this on our vBlock infrastructure today. We provisioned a few,
    large VLANs and then within the VMWare suite of tools, we built a number of security
    groups. Some are for protected tiers (PII, PCI, Database), some are for self-contained
    apps with few outside dependencies. The network (within the distributed virtual
    switch network) is relatively simple now, and controls are done at the security
    group layer. It greatly simplifies provisioning.<br /><br />For tenants, we still
    provision a separate VLAN with an edge gateway, and let the tenant provision their
    own security groups.<br /><br />There have been some challenges. If the VLAN is
    flat, and IP addresses are allocated first-come, first-served, you wind up with
    databases and middleware in non-contiguous IP space. That is fine, but for firewalls
    &quot;outside&quot; of the PAAS stack, they have no way to create an &quot;all
    databases&quot; rule based on a subnet... they now have to put the individual
    host IPs into the rule. A minor challenge. They are looking into IP Pooling and
    other options to allow certain server categories to pull from a range within the
    /20, but these methods are not quite there yet.<br /><br />Overall, it has worked
    well for us.

  html: Or you could use the VID/VNID as the group ID... :-)

  html: Apache CloudStack uses iptables in conjunction with ipsets to achieve this
    scalability. ipset is a fantastic package. We have real-life uses with tens of
    thousands of ips in these sets and the lookup speed is still good enough

  html: Thank you! I learn something new every time you chime in.<br /><br />In the
    iptables case you were fortunate enough to be able to change the matching algorithm
    keeping the complexity down to O(n.log(m)). Sometimes you&#39;re bound by the
    hardware limitations (no way to implement ipset in TCAM) or information transfer
    protocol (no reasonably simple support for ipset-like construct in OpenFlow).
