  html: Ah, a subject close to my heart. Load balancing isn&#39;t for the server guys
    now is it? And we all know how conservative those network guys are. <br /><br
    />In all seriousness, this really is a matter of fear of the unknown and an unwillingness
    to learn about the possibilities and then trust them in production. I hope this
    changes as network engineers are further exposed to both Linux and virtual appliances
    in general.<br /><br />Other products you could add to your list are;<br /><br

    html: Yeah, I would expect to see plenty of open-source load balancing solutions
      in ISP/hosting environments. Commercial load balancers are just too expensive
      to be justified there.

  html: "Hi Ivan.<br /><br />I don\xB4t agree 100% ...  Here in denmark, nginx and\
    \ haproxy is used ALOT.<br /><br />So the company i work in we do shared hosting\
    \ apache,iis etc. All of our competitors also use some sort of opensource load\
    \ balancing ( mostly nginx )<br /><br />We try to not use netscaler, f5 etc. Because\
    \ of price but also creating a dedicated hardware/vm loadbalancer moves configuration\
    \ away from the APP people to the network people :)<br />Trust me the APP people\
    \ way! better at load balancing their own APP."

  html: Last time I looked, VMware vShield Edge (got to love that capitalisation!)
    is in fact HAProxy under the hood. I learnt this when raising a support case and
    watching VMware troubleshoot it. So, more people are using it than may realise
    they are!

  html: 'I personally do favor both IPVS and nginx, but both in their respective fields
    and taking their respective strengths and weaknesses into account.<br /><br />Commercial
    load balancers also often just don&#39;t offer exactly what&#39;s needed. For
    example, we&#39;re running loadbalancers who do perform highlevel backend availability
    checks and accordingly announce (or withdraw) a specific route for internal anycasted
    IP addresses. By installing those systems in multiple data centers, this results
    in a very high availability and low-latency. At worst, a failed service in one
    DC is automatically provided by the same service from a different DC - at some
    additional latency, but still accessible.<br />Most commercial loadbalancers in
    such a situation simply would like to pretend to be a DNS server and reply with
    low-TTL DNS-RRs - which consistently fails with Java applications (who ignored
    DNS-TTLs for years now), let alone give no solution if the service you&#39;re
    trying to load balance is your DNS service.<br /><br />Please also don&#39;t forget
    about IPVS: Linux IP Virtual Server does look more like &quot;typical&quot; L2/L3-level
    load balancers and uses techniques like direct server return (&quot;gatewaying&quot;
    or &quot;direct routing&quot; in IPVS lingo). A smallish box with a 100 Mbit network
    connection can easily handle Gbits of traffic with dozens of backend servers -
    as any outgoing traffic (replies) doesn&#39;t pass the loadbalancer at all.<br
    /><br />Proxy-based systems like nginx and haproxy are also very capable in terms
    of accepting thousands of connections in parallel, which may give you some relief
    if you&#39;re accustomed to an web servers who are easily taken by slowloris-attacks.
    nginx/haproxy do also terminate and create new backend connections, making them
    extremely flexible on your network: your backend servers cound be anywhere, there
    are no restrictions Have your balancer on your network, some backend nodes on
    AWS, some backend nodes in a colo somewhere around your corner, it doesn&#39;t
    matter (ignoring latency). Nginx/haproxy also do offer tons of L7-features which
    may result in a more complex configuration, but a very high benefit on the actual
    application. For example, static content could be served from a specifically tuned
    backend farm, while dynamic content is served by a different farm.<br />However,
    doing so does have impact on deployment and where or how to debug errors. If operations
    and development are a close team and share their knowledge, such setups do work
    out fine - otherwise, it may be hard to draw a line where and how some issue is
    going to be addressed. And some implementation and design issues do open up new
    questions.<br /><br />Most interesting projects are where multiple balancing solutions
    needed to be united: proxy-based systems couldn&#39;t handle the bandwidth, packet-based
    systems couldn&#39;t deliver the needed features. Trying to to that with a commercial
    load balancer can be a task of its own.'

  html: (At the risk of necroposting...)<br /><br />The place I currently work in
    would likely count as an &quot;open source shop&quot; but sends the bulk of its
    traffic through a commercial load balancer.  However, most of the *new* traffic
    on the network is going through HAProxy.  New *clients* get HAProxy installed
    on them - the servers run health checks locally that write status to ZooKeeper,
    the clients discover what services are available by reading from ZooKeeper and
    configure HAProxy; they then connect to HAProxy on localhost to reach the servers.<br
    /><br />HAProxy also has the advantage of better health checks for PostgreSQL
    than our commercial load balancer, but that&#39;s an aside.
