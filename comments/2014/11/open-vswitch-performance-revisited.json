      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br />I&#39;ve done some testing on Neutron + OVS + GRE tunnels in the past and I seem to recall that I got higher numbers than 1.4 Gbps. That being said, I don&#39;t think I managed to get to 10Gbps either.<br />Obviously the page you&#39;re referring to is a quick-and-dirty benchmark. If you wanted the optimal numbers, you would have to tune quite a few parameters just like for hardware benchmarks (sysctl kernel parameters, Jumbo frames, ...). Using VLAN mode, I had no issue to get to 10Gbps. I presume the same is true if you use VXLAN with NICs that can do hardware offload. Check this report on the Mellanox site =&gt; http://community.mellanox.com/thread/1692<br />Anyway, thanks for the blog, I&#39;m always happy to read your content :)",
