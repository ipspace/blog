  html: Hi,<br /><br />Yes we are migrating our hosting environment from vendor type
    environment to OpenStack which we built ourselves and will be paying for the support
    separately. Midokura has been on our list for some time and it is good to see
    that it is open source now. And yes it is much cheaper than running VMware with
    all their MSP licensing.

  html: 'It has a distributed network store where it holds information about the network
    but it doesn&#39;t program the network from a controller.   It&#39;s similar to
    Nuage and Contrail in how it works.  <br /><br />Nuage and Contrail have some
    additional benefits in how they interop with existing hardware and standards,
    I don&#39;t see much on the Midokura side.   The distributed networking stuff
    in the OS Juno release might make it kind of irrelevant unless they have a nice
    GUI or some other compelling feature.  <br /><br />Most of the OS deployments
    I know of are for testing still.   The production ones I know of are from vendors
    like Mirantis, Ubuntu, Redhat, Cisco, etc.  and are turnkey private clouds for
    the most part.    The vast majority are still using ESX since it&#39;s so easy
    to use and manage.  '

  html: We spent a huge amount of time and resources rolling our own OpenStack environment
    (running on Cisco UCS hardware).  A little under a year into it and we&#39;re
    still working out production issues from time to time.  We&#39;re fortunate in
    that our senior openstack guy is brilliant and is able to figure stuff out most
    of the time, but as we start trying to integrate the network into that environment,
    it&#39;s going to be more and more on me and less and less on him to figure it
    out.
