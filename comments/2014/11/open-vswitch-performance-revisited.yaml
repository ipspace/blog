  html: Hi Ivan,<br />I&#39;ve done some testing on Neutron + OVS + GRE tunnels in
    the past and I seem to recall that I got higher numbers than 1.4 Gbps. That being
    said, I don&#39;t think I managed to get to 10Gbps either.<br />Obviously the
    page you&#39;re referring to is a quick-and-dirty benchmark. If you wanted the
    optimal numbers, you would have to tune quite a few parameters just like for hardware
    benchmarks (sysctl kernel parameters, Jumbo frames, ...). Using VLAN mode, I had
    no issue to get to 10Gbps. I presume the same is true if you use VXLAN with NICs
    that can do hardware offload. Check this report on the Mellanox site =&gt; http://community.mellanox.com/thread/1692<br
    />Anyway, thanks for the blog, I&#39;m always happy to read your content :)

  html: http://openvswitch.org/support/ovscon2014/18/1600-ovs_perf.pptx slide 8 says
    6.7 Gbps with VXLAN. As simonp says, with no encapsulation you get line rate.

    html: You lost three zeroes in that calculation (or I can&#39;t type anymore,
      which wouldn&#39;t exactly surprise me ;).

    html: 'oops. re-calc: 18.72 *Gpps*, devided by 1,488,096 (the pps of 1 Gbps Eth)
      =&gt; 12.579 Gbps, which sounds reasonable ... <br /><br />The result remains
      the same, and that what counts ;-) (funny, my professors never bought this excuse
      either)<br /><br />And now, I shell prove I&#39;m not a robot...'

    html: You&#39;re still missing your zeroes (or I&#39;m still asleep). That would
      be 12 Tbps, which is still a bit too much for an x86 server.

  html: 'The slides mentioned earlier (1600-ovs_perf.pptx) shows dpdk-ovs doing almost
    wirespeed (9.9 Gbps /  14.85 Mpps) with 64B packets.<br /><br />Is it possible
    they (Ludicrous Speed guys) meant: 72K flows, each at 260Kpps =&gt; 72k flows
    * 260kpps =  18.72 Mpps = 12.579 Gbps, which sounds reasonable for the 2 x 10GbE
    NICs server you&#39;ve mentioned, without using dpdk&#39;s kernel bypass / zero
    copy / poll mode drivers / etc.<br /><br />How about we just ask them what they
    meant ;-)<br /><br />'
