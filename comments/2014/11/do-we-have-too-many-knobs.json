      "html": "Well I think Cisco tried that with the built in web gui on switches and routers at one point. Remember those? There was the Cluster Management suite on Catalysts switches and Web QoS tools. No one used them but they had good promise at reducing the &quot;knobs&quot; but no one ever used them or knew they were there.<br />This was also &quot;attempted&quot; at the network management level with SNMP as well.",

Seeing how fast IETF progresses in defining Yang models makes me skeptical - I think we need someone coming up with something really cool (like what Arista did with some of their software features) to pull the industry forward.<br /><br />As for NETCONF versus REST - it really doesn&#39;t matter. You can use the same data models regardless of the presentation-layer syntax.",

      "html": "One of the points would be to identify the set of configurable objects that is sufficent to cover 80% of the use cases. Then someone must declare (who will do that?) what &quot;the baseline mandatory set of configurable objects&quot; to make the 80% use cases configurarable really *is*. Then we need some agreement amongst key players in the industry that they put that into their roadmap (ok, that won&#39;t work until a serious portion of the demand side in the market will beat many of them into submission by not longer buying stuff without it). Then you finally need to have publicly available toolkits that allows anyone on the planet to embed and utilize the configuration meachnism and using the YANG definitions within the &quot;wizards&quot;  that you consider potentielly desireable.<br /><br />Do you think a good way to represent the configurable objects and network configuration in Yang models could be  is a proper way to perform transactions on those objects? <br />It seems we have begun to see a growingly stronger traction on a YANG based configuration approach in the IETF Internet drafts at this time - including OSPF, BGP, ISIS, maybe its worth to have a look into every few months into the topic: <br />https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/netmod/documents/ <br /><br />Will this have to compete with RESTFUL APIs like seesn in https://github.com/coreos/etcd or does it make sense to asap have a NETCONF/YANG based configuration interface in Linux as well?",

I am a long time reader of your blogs and respect your perspective. I know you are not really into what we are doing but your iptables example really resonates with what we are doing at Cumulus maybe more than you think.<br /><br />One of our goals is that by standardizing on Linux as a network OS we provide uniform &#39;knobs&#39;, making it possible to create consistent and useful wizards and as you know, Matt Stone has an interesting project to create an API on our platform. (Great podcast btw and we appreciate you keeping an open mind). Many of our customers have written their own custom interfaces and tools that suit their environment. This is something that would be very hard with a traditional network OS.<br /><br />Part of our goal is to smooth the ride to Linux as well since it was developed as a host OS and not a Network OS. There is a lot of work that has been done there with us introducing unnumbered support into Quagga for OSPF and BGP along with creating PTM. We are continuing to work very hard on this aspect including the recent improvement of ifupdown with ifupdown2 which makes greatly improves networking in the Linux world. The job is not finished and we really want to make it so that both Network admins and System admins can feel equally at home. Stay tuned though... there is a lot more good stuff coming and Linux is a fantastic platform to do rapid development on. We are seeing lots of innovation from our expanding community of users also.<br /><br />best regards,<br />Todd",
