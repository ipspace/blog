            <div class="comment-content">Hi,<br /><br />Yes we are migrating our hosting environment from vendor type environment to OpenStack which we built ourselves and will be paying for the support separately. Midokura has been on our list for some time and it is good to see that it is open source now. And yes it is much cheaper than running VMware with all their MSP licensing.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">It has a distributed network store where it holds information about the network but it doesn&#39;t program the network from a controller.   It&#39;s similar to Nuage and Contrail in how it works.  <br /><br />Nuage and Contrail have some additional benefits in how they interop with existing hardware and standards, I don&#39;t see much on the Midokura side.   The distributed networking stuff in the OS Juno release might make it kind of irrelevant unless they have a nice GUI or some other compelling feature.  <br /><br />Most of the OS deployments I know of are for testing still.   The production ones I know of are from vendors like Mirantis, Ubuntu, Redhat, Cisco, etc.  and are turnkey private clouds for the most part.    The vast majority are still using ESX since it&#39;s so easy to use and manage.  </div>

            <div class="comment-content">We spent a huge amount of time and resources rolling our own OpenStack environment (running on Cisco UCS hardware).  A little under a year into it and we&#39;re still working out production issues from time to time.  We&#39;re fortunate in that our senior openstack guy is brilliant and is able to figure stuff out most of the time, but as we start trying to integrate the network into that environment, it&#39;s going to be more and more on me and less and less on him to figure it out.</div>
