But not when the CxO signs off on something (without consulting IT) for which you must now construct a use case.<br /><br />In the middle of an &lt;#1 cloud provider&gt; IaaS deployment which you&#39;d think be simple enough:<br /><br />1) Build IPsec VPN to Provider<br />2) Build/Migrate desired servers<br />3) Consume services<br /><br />Not so. I&#39;ve spent more time than I&#39;d care to admit troubleshooting VPN issues because the cloud provider is either unable to unwilling to provide logs to assist with troubleshooting. What would normally be a fairly quick process becomes exacerbated by lack of meaningful data to assist; it quickly devolves into a guessing game. Just my own experience anyway.",
