            <div class="comment-content">Hm, I don&#39;t know Ivan. At least judging by their website, the thing is vapour...  I&#39;ve seen a lot of your comments when they add an overlay (or an simplified interface) to the same technologies... Complexity is worse than before, nothing new when you really look into the wires, the same protocols... in the end, when the thing is broken, some has to fix it and you end up knowing all these protocols anyway.  Nice little movie for a start with even nicer marketing layers of network. By drawing nice layers you can&#39;t say that everything works in a new way. </div>
