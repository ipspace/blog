  html: Simply put; NO.<br /><br />I&#39;m working in an SP, and we will never accept
    to receive a /32 route except for the RTBH.

  html: Another option would be to use BGP deaggregation, in Cisco the feature for
    this is Conditional Route Injection. For this you need a longer prefix in order
    to inject the host or a more specific prefix (it also works to create a copy with
    the same length of the original prefix). Sometimes might be useful in MPLS/VPN
    networks.
