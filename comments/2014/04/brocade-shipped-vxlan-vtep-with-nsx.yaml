    html: 'You can&#39;t fix my issues with Brocade. Alle cases closed, b/c worked
      as designed. ;) Waiting 20 mins. for a stupid NETCONF get-config call is absurd.
      Or try to configure an interface range in VCS logical chassis with 20 switches.
      Auto-completion of commands takes several seconds, it feels like running into
      a timeout. Sometimes I&#39;m thinking that Brocade develops VDX switches, but
      don&#39;t use them self. '

  html: "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />&quot;It\u2019s amazing to see how Brocade leapfrogged\
    \ everyone else (they also added tons of other new functionality in NOS releases\
    \ 4.0 and 4.1).&quot;<br /><br />Well, you&#39;re right: It&#39;s amazing to see\
    \ what features offered by Brocade and if you read all the papers about Brocade\
    \ VCS fabric everything looks awesome! But I&#39;m running a VCS logical chassis\
    \ at work and in my opinion, it&#39;s not as good as everything you can read about\
    \ it. <br /><br />I had lot&#39;s issues, some are still unsolved, and running\
    \ the fabric is no fun. NETCONF is unusable and if you&#39;re fabric is large\
    \ even some CLI tasks are very slow. Plug&amp;play deployment of new switches\
    \ as described by Brocade is a lie and if you running VDX6710, 6720 or 6730 switches\
    \ throw them away. We have to replace 17 only 5-months old VDX6710 switches b/c\
    \ they disable the support of Virtual Fabrics and VXLAN VTEP in our fabric. NOS\
    \ 5 may be the first release that won&#39;t run on these switches, b/c they don&#39;t\
    \ have enough memory!!! For RJ45-based 100/1000 MBits connection we need to buy\
    \ the &quot;new&quot; 6740T-1G switch, which only offers four 40Gig optical uplinks.\
    \ You need to buy expensive QSFP+ modules and MPO splitter cable. Upgrading from\
    \ NOS 4.0.0b to 4.1.0 was fun, too. Every switch with the newer NOS version wasn&#39;t\
    \ centrally manageable until every switch in the fabric was upgraded to 4.1.0.\
    \ But this includes a disruptive reboot. BTW. rebooting a VDX switch takes up\
    \ to 10 mins. ;) In-Band Management doesn&#39;t support the VCS virtual ip. So\
    \ you have to configure OOB, but be careful, don&#39;t transport theses packets\
    \ thru the fabric, it leads to unexpected behavior. Last but not least configuring\
    \ L3-features is similar to having single, standalone switches. <br /><br />Do\
    \ you need more feedback about the GREAT Brocade VDX series? ;))))<br /><br />Kind\
    \ regards.<br />Tschokko<br />"

  html: "I should mention, that Brocade releases nearly every month a new NOS version,\
    \ which add a features they promised several months before. The firmware has no\
    \ chance to get mature and stable. My favourit example is a NETCONF issue that\
    \ was fixed in a NOS 4.0.x release and refixed some minor releases later again,\
    \ without  success. ;)  In Germany I would describe the development of NOS with\
    \ the words: &quot;Mit hei\xDFer Nadel gestrickt&quot;. This is hot code with\
    \ perhaps only basic testing and quality assurance.  Be careful.<br /><br />Kind\

    html: Does NSX-V not use OVSDB to control VTEPs? Why?

    html: It was my understanding that NSX-MH uses OpenFlow and does not support third-party
      HW VTEPs, whereas NSX-V uses whatever proprietary protocol internally and OVSDB
      to communicate with HW VTEPs. Will investigate.

  html: For clarity this is OVSDB VXLAN support for NSX-MH rather than for NSX-V.  I
    think it would be helpful to get in the habit of distinguishing the two VMware
    products rather than just writing &#39;NSX&#39;
