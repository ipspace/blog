      "html": "&quot;A few hundred switches (for a pretty low value of few) is probably the largest fabric you can build&quot;<br /><br />That&#39;s a pathetic low number.<br />In 1997-1998, iMCI had a backbone with 500 routers, running IS-IS in a single area. Those 500 routers were connected in a double full mesh over an ATM cloud. You can&#39;t get a worse/heavier topology for flooding. And it ran IS-IS just fine.<br /><br />Note, that were cisco 7000s and 7500s. Which had a Motorola 68040 processor in the control plane. That&#39;s a 25MHz cpu ! If you could do 500 routers in a flat area with 25MHz cpus, you should be able do much larger numbers today. I&#39;m sure I could make IS-IS run with 10000 routers/switches, and a million endpoints. Today, with using modern cheap Intel CPUs. Why hasn&#39;t that been done yet ?<br /><br />BGP is a great protocol. I am less a fan of MPLS myself. (I never thought the added complexity outweighs the benefits). But some people in high places have always been in love with BGP and MPLS. A bit too much, imho. For them, MPLS is the hammer, and all problems look like nails.",

Not sure about this one though.",

          "html": "I&#39;d also like to reply to Pete Welcher&#39;s comments and concerns about the nature of L2 forwarding in the SPBM context.  This reaction is quite common and understandable given the history of Ethernet bridging and its inseparable ties with Spanning Tree.  However these concerns are unfounded, as well as the belief that TRILL/FabricPath would, in some way, be better than SPBM.<br /> <br />Yes, an SPBM end-point node (BEB, Backbone Edge Bridge) will do MAC learning (and flooding) of end-user MAC Addresses, but only inside a Layer 2 VPN service (L2 Virtual Service Network \u2013 L2VSN \u2013 in Avaya\u2019s language).  The learning is done against Ethernet ports for traffic arriving from outside the SPBM Fabric (as is commonly done by all Ethernet bridging devices) but it is also now done against the originating Source Backbone MAC (BMAC) of distant BEB as the MAC-in-MAC traffic is decapsulated on its way out of the SPBM Fabric.  This MAC learning/flooding happens only within the L2VSN service and only on the BEB nodes, not in the underlying SPBM Fabric (TRILL/FabricPath are essentially doing the same thing).<br /><br />Inside the SPBM Fabric (on BCB, Backbone Core Bridge, nodes) it&#39;s a completely different story, as there is no MAC learning and there is no MAC flooding.  Here it is purely transport and the only reachability that counts is towards the BMAC Addresses, and IS-IS caters for this.<br /><br />I usually like to explain the parallel of how SPBM&#39;s IS-IS works in comparison to OSPF (which is more or less well understood by Enterprise folks).<br />An OSPF Router does an SPF run on its copy of the OSPF LSDB and works out, from where it stands in the topology, the shortest path to every IP route; the results are then trimmed and used to populate its IP Routing table where the next-hop is the IP Address of the immediate next-hop towards that shortest path for that given IP route.<br />An SPBM Switch does an SPF run on its copy of the SPBM IS-IS LSDB and works out, from where it stands in the topology, the shortest path to every other BMAC in the SPBM Fabric (if you have 100 nodes in the SPBM Fabric, then you have 100 BMACs advertised by IS-IS; not a particularly huge number); the results are then trimmed and used to populate the MAC table of 1 (or more) &quot;special&quot; Backbone VLAN (BVLAN), where the next-hop is the Ethernet port of the immediate next-hop towards that shortest path for that given BMAC. The BVLAN is &quot;special&quot; because MAC learning and flooding on this Backbone VLAN is switched off in hardware (obeying the Spanning Tree state of the Ethernet ports inside the SPBM Fabric - discarding/forwarding is also switched off in hardware).  In short these BVLANs are essentially just a repository of MAC tables calculated and populated by IS-IS.<br /><br />So SPBM has the same properties you can expect from a well-designed OSPF backbone, where all the OSPF adjacencies are point-to-point (I say &quot;well-designed&quot;, because in some cases OSPF networks are deployed over broadcast segments which then compromises the speed at which OSPF can react to failures).  TRILL/FabricPath are conceptually the same and certainly no better than SPBM.<br />The subtle differences between TRILL/FabricPath and SPBM are a tradeoff where the former can spray traffic over an unlimited number of equal cost paths, but it pays a heavy price by not being able to support 802.1ag CFM which is the industry standard Ethernet OAM. CFM brings crucial L2 \u2018ping\u2019 and L2 \u2018trace route\u2019 capabilities to SPBM.<br /><br />Also the fact that TRILL/FabricPath only uses a VLAN-ID and not a Service-ID (I-SID) means that the Avaya Layer 3 VPN (L3VSN) solution described in the main article above would simply not be possible there. <br /><br />Finally to come back to the case of the L3VSN (L3VPN) service type described in the article above, there is simply no MAC learning/flooding anywhere, because we are talking IP routing inside the service and SPBM MAC routing (as I described above) inside the SPBM Fabric.",

          "html": "And, as I ran out of characters in the above post\u2026!<br /><br />So why use IS-IS to build a better L2..?<br />In the case of SPBM I can list you these benefits for an Enterprise customer:<br /> <br />a) As we are operating at L2, delivering L2 virtualized transport is a piece of cake (compare that with the complexity of MPLS + VPLS); TRILL/FabricPath are also good at this\u2026<br />b) As we can integrate the IP routing directly inside the SPBM Fabric, leveraging IS-IS, we don\u2019t need external IP Routers and we hence can extend SPBM&#39;s benefits and simplicity end-end\u2026<br />c) As we support L3VSNs (L3VPNs), we can easily do Enterprise-grade L3 virtualization; compare that with VRF-Lite or MPLS BGP IPVPNs\u2026<br />d) What we can do with IPv4, we can do equally well with IPv6, with the same IS-IS instance (just a different set of TLVs).  Consider the pain of having to run both OSPFv2 for IPv4 and OSPFv3 for IPv6 in traditional dual-stack designs<br />e) SPBM&#39;s use of IS-IS delivers something extra, which neither OSPF or TRILL/FabricPath can do; Service-specific Multicast delivery trees; so you can easily enable IP Multicast for any of the above services (a), (b), (c)...  Now, try doing that with VPLS, for each and every service, and try doing that with BGP IPVPNs over MPLS; in all cases you don&#39;t have to get your hands dirty with PIM-SM; just one instance of IS-IS in the Core and IGMP in the Access\u2026<br />f) Cherry on the cake, consistent and sub-second failover for all of the above; try doing that with BGP-based services, or even worse with PIM-SM",

      "html": "The L2 forwarding part is what concerns me. I understand SPBm as building a shortest path tree per I-SID. Ok, that beats Spanning Tree. But then the actual forwarding between nodes at the endpoints of the tree is L2 forwarding, which requires flooding and (outer) MAC learning. Sort of L2 MAC-based tunneling. Whereas TRILL and FabricPath do routed tunnels between endpoints. <br /><br />I just can&#39;t help feeling that using IS-IS to build a better L2 path is a bit ... unnatural, self-defeating? I&#39;m also thinking some of the negatives of H-VPLS probably apply as well, in slightly different form, e.g. failure response behavior. <br /><br />Your thoughts on this: pros / cons? Yes, I agree, BGP has proven scalability. ",

      "html": "Since I have a good understanding of the Avaya SPBM solution I&#39;d just like to add some complementary information to a couple of points Ivan raised.<br /><br />&gt; BGP is a much richer protocol than IS-IS when it comes to routing policies. There are numerous arcane MPLS/VPN architectures that cannot be implemented with the simple L3VPN model Avaya is using. Admittedly, you wouldn\u2019t find them in most enterprise networks<br /><br />This is true. We are however enhancing the way we use the L3VSN (L3VPN) services to be able to emulate some of that capability.<br />For example we will soon have the ability to selectively import VPN routes associated with other I-SIDs from the one of the importing VPN. I.e. this effectively will give us the same capability that BGP has with using multiple import RTs to accept VPN routes from other IPVPNs. You can therefore replicate some of the more complex BGP IPVPN architectures.<br />A common design objective for this in the enterprise space, is to segments users into distinct L3 routing domains (L3VSNs) so that they cannot communicate with one another, but at the same time we want those separate user groups (routing domains) to be able to access shared servers or shared Firewalls, which are located in a 3rd routing domain to this effect.<br /><br />&gt; Avaya\u2019s SPB-based L3VPN implementation is pretty new, so tread carefully. For example, it seems route redistribution loops could cause major headaches (see configuration guide, page 173).<br /><br />This is also true. Correctly configuring route redistribution between 2 different IP routing protocols (using 2 or more border routers) needs to be done with care.<br />However that particular challenge described in the configuration guide, is no different from the challenges we used to face when migrating RIP networks to OSPF in days gone past.",
