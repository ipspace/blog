            <div class="comment-content">A couple of issues:<br /><br />1) From VMware&#39;s vSwitch documentation - &quot;VMware virtual switches drop any double-encapsulated frames that a virtual machine attempts to send on a port configured for a specific VLAN. Therefore, they are not vulnerable to this type of attack.&quot;<br /><br />2) I believe the vSwitches to either equal or better than most physical equipment. They have only employed required technologies and capabilities. A lot of Cisco&#39;s issue is the superfluous code that is built in creating a large attack space. <br /><br />3) Most hypervisor attacks require extremely complex and often local setups. Given the level of deployment and few if any successful exploits, I would turn the security eye to applications or the false network paradigm of DMZ.<br /><br />So I agree with your premise that Hypervisors should be taken off of the skewer and treated as an equal (or better) to the rest of the enterprise.</div>
