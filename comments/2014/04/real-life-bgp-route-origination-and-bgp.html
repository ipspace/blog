            <div class="comment-content">Hello,<br /><br />The case is interesting, but I find the solution in the category &quot;we do things, but we don&#39;t know why we do them&quot;. Let me explain:<br /> - Wasn&#39;t *i*BGP supposed to be used within an *autonomous* (routing) system ? Such as &quot;same entity controls all equipment within the AS&quot; ? <br /> - Another question is why the CE (*customer* edge) is managed by the provider not the  customer (which happens to already able to run/operate BGP on other equipment) ?<br /><br />Globally it is a workaround to a problem that was supposed to be a solution in the first place.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Good points, but sometimes reality intervenes ;) Provider-controlled CE-router (yeah, I know, an oxymoron) is a pretty common scenario, usually due to SLA issues, so I would say this is in the &quot;we do things because we have to do them this way&quot; category.<br />.<br />BTW, do you object to IBGP being run within the main site or not being run across DMVPN?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">As a general rule, neither of the 2 aspects can be objected, but this assumes that &quot;withing the main site&quot; means &quot;within the same location of the autonomous system&quot; and &quot;one autonomous system, one AS number&quot; (basic BGP-related assumption). This is obviously not the case. It&#39;s like saying &quot;red is blue&quot;.<br /><br />Concerning the &quot;provided-controlled CE&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;managed services&quot;), this is something that can be negotiated; it&#39;s not easy, but it may be possible (evoking a &quot;possible deal-breaker condition&quot; helps). As for the SLAs, &quot;waiting the next maintenance window&quot; for static routes modification, this sounds like a serious issue to me. So yes, reality hits, and sometimes for the wrong reasons.<br /><br />I would also like to present some other possible scenarios (hopefully they did not seem to be applied case here) : <br /> - The provider operating the CE decides to force (ex. via route-map) the next-hop for the incoming routes to a &quot;known-good&quot; gateway (BGP peer, previously-agreed &quot;Default gateway, .....<br /> - The provider uses filters inbound routes. If you need to announce new routes you may need their prefix-list updated, with the same reactivity as adding static routes.<br /><br />Those being said, this may be an interesting school-case for learning how BGP signalling works, iBGP edition (for the eBGP edition I would definitely choose the route-servers from an IXP).</div>
