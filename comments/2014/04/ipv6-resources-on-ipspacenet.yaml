    html: The /64 boundary has special meaning only for SLAAC, everything else works
      on any subnet mask.<br /><br />As for /48 being ridiculous and a few other things,
      I totally agree with you, but the arguments have turned into religion years
      ago - just join any major IPv6 mailing list (v6ops comes to mind) and enjoy
      the show.

  html: I have a question as to why /64 is the boundary for VLSM that breaks critical
    functions such as RA, ND, SEND etc. For a home network, a /48 is a RIDICULOUS
    amount of addresses to have at your disposal. Why can I not make a couple of /120
    networks in ULA space, have DHCP servers that can work with /120, and then get
    a PD DHCP from my carrier and let it autoconfig the GUA space for my hosts?<br
    /><br />It doesn&#39;t make much sense to me.
