We use the typical 7k/5k/2k in the server environments, but we wanted a dedicated backup network, shared by Prod and non-Prod, operates 24/7, no impact to prod bandwidth. We basically decided on an out-of-band switch stack with dedicated cabling. The extremely simplified layer-3 requirements and separate routing table completely justified the decision to use a pair of Distribution 5ks with L3 modules and a LOT of Access 5ks. We realized a huge savings over the 7k on a cost-per-10gb-port basis. It&#39;s less oversubscribed too.<br /><br />Incidentally, when we inquired about future Layer-3 for 5k platforms, we learned that 5k and 7k were different internal business units at Cisco and there was quite a bit of contention as the platforms overlapped. We were thinking that if they just add a few more features, we&#39;d probably use the 5ks far more frequently for L3-switching .<br /><br />CWB",
