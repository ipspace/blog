      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />&quot;It\u2019s amazing to see how Brocade leapfrogged everyone else (they also added tons of other new functionality in NOS releases 4.0 and 4.1).&quot;<br /><br />Well, you&#39;re right: It&#39;s amazing to see what features offered by Brocade and if you read all the papers about Brocade VCS fabric everything looks awesome! But I&#39;m running a VCS logical chassis at work and in my opinion, it&#39;s not as good as everything you can read about it. <br /><br />I had lot&#39;s issues, some are still unsolved, and running the fabric is no fun. NETCONF is unusable and if you&#39;re fabric is large even some CLI tasks are very slow. Plug&amp;play deployment of new switches as described by Brocade is a lie and if you running VDX6710, 6720 or 6730 switches throw them away. We have to replace 17 only 5-months old VDX6710 switches b/c they disable the support of Virtual Fabrics and VXLAN VTEP in our fabric. NOS 5 may be the first release that won&#39;t run on these switches, b/c they don&#39;t have enough memory!!! For RJ45-based 100/1000 MBits connection we need to buy the &quot;new&quot; 6740T-1G switch, which only offers four 40Gig optical uplinks. You need to buy expensive QSFP+ modules and MPO splitter cable. Upgrading from NOS 4.0.0b to 4.1.0 was fun, too. Every switch with the newer NOS version wasn&#39;t centrally manageable until every switch in the fabric was upgraded to 4.1.0. But this includes a disruptive reboot. BTW. rebooting a VDX switch takes up to 10 mins. ;) In-Band Management doesn&#39;t support the VCS virtual ip. So you have to configure OOB, but be careful, don&#39;t transport theses packets thru the fabric, it leads to unexpected behavior. Last but not least configuring L3-features is similar to having single, standalone switches. <br /><br />Do you need more feedback about the GREAT Brocade VDX series? ;))))<br /><br />Kind regards.<br />Tschokko<br />",

      "html": "I should mention, that Brocade releases nearly every month a new NOS version, which add a features they promised several months before. The firmware has no chance to get mature and stable. My favourit example is a NETCONF issue that was fixed in a NOS 4.0.x release and refixed some minor releases later again, without  success. ;)  In Germany I would describe the development of NOS with the words: &quot;Mit hei\u00dfer Nadel gestrickt&quot;. This is hot code with perhaps only basic testing and quality assurance.  Be careful.<br /><br />Kind regards.<br />Tschokko<br />",
