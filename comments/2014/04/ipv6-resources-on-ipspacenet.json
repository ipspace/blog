      "html": "I have a question as to why /64 is the boundary for VLSM that breaks critical functions such as RA, ND, SEND etc. For a home network, a /48 is a RIDICULOUS amount of addresses to have at your disposal. Why can I not make a couple of /120 networks in ULA space, have DHCP servers that can work with /120, and then get a PD DHCP from my carrier and let it autoconfig the GUA space for my hosts?<br /><br />It doesn&#39;t make much sense to me.",
