      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />thanks! for the - as usual - quite enlightening post.<br />May I add some unordered remarks?<br /><br />You write about &quot;run a pilot project&quot; and &quot;do an audit before deploying IPv6&quot;.<br />Not sure if the problem(s) would have been discovered/exposed in a pilot as they seem related to &quot;coupling effects&quot; (see RFC 3439) once a certain scale is/as reached, which in turn &quot;the pilot&quot; might not have (had).<br />As for the audits you mention ... given the two of us are regularly involved in enterprise projects - how many of such audits have you seen in IPv6 space? Me, to be diplomatic ;-), well: not too many.<br /><br />Further you state: &quot;Also, if you don\u2019t use IPv6 multicast, I don&#39;t see any need to run MLD on the LAN \u2013 turn it off if you can&quot;.<br />That&#39;s exactly (part of) the problem: to the best of my knowledge you simple can&#39;t (turn it off), at least not on the host/OS level. which is why we did our testing described in http://www.insinuator.net/2014/09/mld-and-neighbor-discovery-are-they-related/ by locally blocking outgoing MLD packets (which of course is not a strategy for large scale operations. we did it just for testing purposes).<br /><br />Best <br /><br />Enno",

I have run IPv6 networks for over 10 years on far less capable hardware with significantly less control mechanisms (dhcpv6) without running into these issues, so I&#39;m calling shenanigans on it.
