This is how network engineers end up being responsible for packet de-duplication, managing SSL transactions, providing security barriers, etc.  Essentially serving as everyone&#39;s IT daddy.  Mr. Pepelnjak explains it well here:<br /><br />http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/04/this-is-what-makes-networking-so-complex.html ",

      "html": "Example broken process:  Company X deploys lots of iPads running a custom App for specific use case.  Apple then releases a new iOS version and the iPads begin displaying pop-up message to upgrade.  Naturally, users start initiating the upgrade.  Problem: the custom App has not yet been tested with the new iOS.  Instant fire drill, director and C level guys howling.  Network guy (moi) ends up applying Cisco NBAR filter at every branch to prevent the iPads from presenting the upgrade option to the user.  Now when Company X actually DOES want to upgrade iOS, the network team must get involved to remove the filter, allow the upgrade to occur, then put filter back in place.  Kludge.",
