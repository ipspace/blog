      "html": "VSAN aggregates local attached disks either with a HBA controller in pass-through (aka IT mode) or RAID adapter in RAID0 mode (aka JBOD mode).<br /><br />Anyway, a minimum of one SSD + one HDD is required.<br /><br />Therefore I doubt if ever this UCS mini will make it into VSAN HCL in the current state... Maybe in an all-flash VSAN version though but this is only speculation :)<br /><br />",

      "html": "I think VSAN is not a right option in that case. For VSAN we need at least 3 (or better 4) rack server nodes. And also we need to license all our blade servers in order to access the VSAN cluster.<br />It will be really expansive solution.<br /><br />IMHO the best option here is to buy any NFS/iSCSI storage. Thus we&#39;ll get a modified version of FlexPod/VSPEX architecture - FlexPod-mini/VSPEX-mini :).<br /><br />And of course we always have an option with OpenStack + Swift/Ceph.",
