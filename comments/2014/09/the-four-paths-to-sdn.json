      "html": "Ivan, great article as usual. A couple of comments:<br /><br />I agree that using OpenFlow to augment forwarding functionality is a good use case: marking / steering large flows, blocking DDoS flood attacks etc. In addition to HP, there are a few other vendors that I am aware of that support OpenFlow NORMAL (integrated hybrid mode): Brocade, Alcatel Lucent Enterprise, and Mellanox.<br /><br />You didn&#39;t mention Cumulus. SDN protocols become much less important when you have an open Linux switch platform. You can compile and install your own management daemon and implement whatever protocol best suits the task (and blend local and remote control). For example, it is possible to build a simple REST API to manipulate ACLs using standard Linux iptables commands on Cumlus Linux in around 200 lines of Python.",

Likewise, Junos is Juniper&#39;s core business and I never expected to get it for free. <br /><br />OTOH, putting documentation behind a regwall, particularly when similar documentation is freely available from your competitors, is self-defeating, or it might make people think that you have something to hide.<br /><br />Finally, I&#39;m willing to have any (at least somewhat technical) argument you wish as long as you have the guts to put your name to your comment. Without that, the debate stops here.",
