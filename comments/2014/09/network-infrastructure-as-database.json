They should probably just fire themselves right now. /sarcasm.<br /><br />The goal of &quot;SDN&quot; isn&#39;t to make life easier or &quot;empower the network engineer&quot; to do other things than to create vlans. While that is part of it, the goal is to make the skill set obsolete so you don&#39;t have to spend money on those people anymore. The only question is if it&#39;ll work to the extent that some people think.<br /><br />To &quot;hate&quot; someone for having these concerns only tells me that you completely lack empathy.",

If you aren&#39;t continuously developing your skills, eventually you&#39;ll be out of a job.  If the next major transition in networking is repeatable, scripted/reciped/etc. configurations, then you&#39;d better learn how to write those scripts/recipes.",

But no matter how many times we test something in the lab, they do occasionally fail. We do them in maintenance windows to reduce the risk that a failure would affect the business. Even if we had a hundred successful windows in a row, changes to business systems will happen off-hours. Automated or not. This isn&#39;t old-thinking, it&#39;s reality. ",

      "html": "Nice and very illustrative article.<br /><br />And agrede with Amanda,,, I feel that exciting challenges and opportunities are coming, and if we think that all we can contribute as NW engineers is configure ports and VLANs, then we have a real problem... I would expect that we can provide much more value than simply memorise  a set of commands and then blindly repeat them.. We understand how complex computer systems communicate and the challenges they present... And is up to us to keep learning and evolving,,, that is the fun part, isn&#39;t it?<br /><br />I don&#39;t know... but I think that to reduce the SDN wave to a debate around NW engineers versus programmer profiles (or OMG! I&#39;m going to be replaced by a script!) is a bit simplistic and underestimate ourselves.",
