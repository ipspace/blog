What is the alternative - assuming we are not going to get better designed applications in the near future?  What would you recommend for geographical redundancy/DR?<br /><br />Looking forward to chapter 9 of your &quot;Data Center Design Case Studies&quot; book!",

I understand the objections about Layer 2 connections between datacenters, but not about long-distance vMotion and desire to provide continuity to non-redundantly designed applications.<br /><br />Suppose we do a long-distance vMotion across vSwitches,  and have no true L2 extension, but say an OSPFD instance on the VM announcing its routed /32,  or a Proxy-Arp gateway instead of a true L2 extension.<br /><br />Maybe long-distance vMotion has great uses, but we aren&#39;t sufficiently imaginative to give them fair consideration.<br /><br />",
