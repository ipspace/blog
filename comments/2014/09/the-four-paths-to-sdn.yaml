    html: OpFlex comes more under the &quot;existing protocols&quot;, it&#39;s not
      a network element API. Assuming it&#39;s policy propagation protocol, it looks
      to be an alternative to NETCONF.

  html: 'Hey Ivan!<br />Yes, you&#39;re missing Cisco&#39;s ACI/APIC which uses a
    new protocol called OpFlex: is it because it goes way beyond what current SDN
    can achieve right now? ;)<br /><br />Even Martin Casado talks now about policy-based
    SDN: see packet pushers show 203.'

  html: 'Ivan, great article as usual. A couple of comments:<br /><br />I agree that
    using OpenFlow to augment forwarding functionality is a good use case: marking
    / steering large flows, blocking DDoS flood attacks etc. In addition to HP, there
    are a few other vendors that I am aware of that support OpenFlow NORMAL (integrated
    hybrid mode): Brocade, Alcatel Lucent Enterprise, and Mellanox.<br /><br />You
    didn&#39;t mention Cumulus. SDN protocols become much less important when you
    have an open Linux switch platform. You can compile and install your own management
    daemon and implement whatever protocol best suits the task (and blend local and
    remote control). For example, it is possible to build a simple REST API to manipulate
    ACLs using standard Linux iptables commands on Cumlus Linux in around 200 lines
    of Python.'

    html: Dear Anonymous,<br /><br />Just because you&#39;re upset that you cannot
      download the video that you want to watch without paying for it doesn&#39;t
      make it OK to write nonsense.<br /><br />Webinars are my core business and pay
      my bills so I can generate tons of free content that you obviously read (btw,
      how much free content did you generate lately?). Likewise, Junos is Juniper&#39;s
      core business and I never expected to get it for free. <br /><br />OTOH, putting
      documentation behind a regwall, particularly when similar documentation is freely
      available from your competitors, is self-defeating, or it might make people
      think that you have something to hide.<br /><br />Finally, I&#39;m willing to
      have any (at least somewhat technical) argument you wish as long as you have
      the guts to put your name to your comment. Without that, the debate stops here.

  html: 'Really? Placing important documents behind regwall is so 2014? Have you tried
    accessing videos and documents at: <br /><br />http://cms.ipspace.net/bin/get?doc=777d58c2-526a-11e1-96be-005056880254
    <br /><br />I am sure we all have our own justifications for regwalls/paywalls.
    <br /><br />Disclaimer: I don&#39;t work for Juniper.'
