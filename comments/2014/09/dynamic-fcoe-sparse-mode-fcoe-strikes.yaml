  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Maybe I&#39;m wrong, but most of the customers we meet
    today are not worried about the health of their storage network. They just power
    it on and hope it&#39;ll work as designed. As soon as it works, they don&#39;t
    touch it any more except when they have to add new F_Ports or they are experiencing
    compatibility issues.<br /><br />Multihop FCoE is lacking of monitoring tools
    today, but I&#39;m pretty sure that we have exactly the same issue with FC networks.
    The only things that differs is you have dedicated networks for those type of
    traffic (FC and Dedicated links FCoE), so congestion should be quite simple to
    deal with.<br /><br />With Dynamic FCoE, to me, the only sexy features you have
    are :<br />- no more storage licences on the spine<br />- high availibility of
    each fabric even in case of spine failure (with guaranteed isolation, cf J Metz
    blog post)<br />- lots of bandwidth between the core and edge (N*10G/40G)<br />-
    REAL mutualized infrastructures, that could be a disadvantage in some cases (lack
    of visibility, QoS, ...) but in most cases is really appreciated by customers
    (they don&#39;t understand the marketing term Unified Fabric and the fact you
    have to dedicate links for FCoE)<br /><br />But I strongly agree with you, you
    won&#39;t have more visibility that you already have today... The day we will
    have tools to guarantee to applications that network is clearly not concerned
    about performance issues in FC/FCoE storage networks, we&#39;ll have done a big
    step I think!<br /><br />Pierre-Louis

    html: It&#39;s my understanding that the leaf switch should be an FCF (Nexus 5x00).
      As always, I may be totally wrong ;)

    html: Thanks Ivan for your quick response.<br /><br />Please let me know if my
      understanding below makes sense:<br /><br />Assume the leaf switch has to be
      FCF, then will the multi-vendor network be an issue? For example, I have a network
      environment with 40G/100G spine and 10G leaf all from one vendor but they are
      not FCoE aware but support DRILL (or maybe Cisco Fabric Path). Then I want to
      incorporate FCoE FCF, which is from another vendor but also support DRILL or
      Fabric Path, into existing environment, does that mean we have to re-connect
      host cable for existing non-FCF switch to the FCF?<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br
      />Ben.<br /><br /><br />

    html: 'If you want to run Dynamic FCoE in multi-vendor environment, then you really
      should talk to your Cisco SE (or even better: an FCoE specialist), not try to
      resolve design challenges by asking questions on blogs ;) ... BTW, I&#39;m guessing
      the answer might be &quot;not supported&quot;.'

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />For the Dynamic FCoE configuration, does the leaf switch
    have to be an FCF? Can we use a generic non-FCoE aware switch as leaf to connect
    hosts?<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Ben

  html: Thank Ivan. <br /><br />It seems FCoE community latest draft comes up with
    something like FDF, which looks to me like a simplified FCoE aware bridging device
    that can uplink to FCF and downlink to hosts. Looks to me Cisco is what behind
    to drive FDF/FCF (they call it FCDF) standard so I guess once it comes into GA
    product it will add more complexities and cause more confusions and compatibility
    issues. Maybe I&#39;m wrong but sounds to me FCoE community is repeating the same
    compatibility mistakes as they did in FC SAN.<br /><br />Ben.<br />
