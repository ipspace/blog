I&#39;ve used http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios-xml/ios/sec_conn_dmvpn/configuration/15-2mt/ip6-dmvpn.html but there may be an updated version of that doc that is more current. The routing protocol selection (as you are aware) is likely the bigger deal given what you want to do. We can chat at Interop if you want to chat details. - Ed H.",

So if you have ASRs or ISR-G2s I would be comfortable deploying with testing.  The other big caveat is you have to make sure your carriers and internal operations/NMS can handle this decision.",
