  html: Ivan,<br />It works, I&#39;ve run v6 over v6, v6 over v4, and v4 over v4 just
    not v4 over v6 in my lab and some small deployments. I&#39;ve used http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios-xml/ios/sec_conn_dmvpn/configuration/15-2mt/ip6-dmvpn.html
    but there may be an updated version of that doc that is more current. The routing
    protocol selection (as you are aware) is likely the bigger deal given what you
    want to do. We can chat at Interop if you want to chat details. - Ed H.

  html: It&#39;s working fine. I&#39;ve run v6 over v6 and v6 over v4 in a test environment
    using ios xe. Last I looked 6 months ago, the 6500 can&#39;t do any v6 dmvpn yet.

  html: On my side I tried ipv4 over ipv6 ipsec tunnel, so my outside interfaces were
    in ipv6 while inside were in ipv4... and it works well<br />I used &quot;mode
    gre ipv6&quot; with &quot;protection ipsec&quot; with IOS 15.1(4)M6<br />it was
    in VTI<br />Nico

  html: It was my understanding that while DMVPN could transport either v4 or v6 in
    its tunnels, it required a v4 WAN at this time.

  html: Per Cisco Live Europe, 2013, BRKSEC-3052:<br />* Cat 6500 - Not recommended
    for DMVPN<br />* IPv6 transport support (underlying transport or &quot;outer&quot;
    VPN) added in IOS 15.2(1)T and IOS-XE 3.8S<br /><br />Also, 15.2(4)M was classified
    as a mainline release in June of 2013 and is currently one of the recommended
    releases for the ISR-G2s.  So if you have ASRs or ISR-G2s I would be comfortable
    deploying with testing.  The other big caveat is you have to make sure your carriers
    and internal operations/NMS can handle this decision.
