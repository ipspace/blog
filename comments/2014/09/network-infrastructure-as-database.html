I also hate when it isn&#39;t verbalized, but you see the wheels turning and coming to this conclusion inappropriately. Perhaps those folks shouldn&#39;t have a job if they don&#39;t see the advantages.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Yes, being worried about how you are going to provide for your family in the future when it seems that the skills you&#39;ve spent 10 years building aren&#39;t needed anymore is completely unnatural. They should probably just fire themselves right now. /sarcasm.<br /><br />The goal of &quot;SDN&quot; isn&#39;t to make life easier or &quot;empower the network engineer&quot; to do other things than to create vlans. While that is part of it, the goal is to make the skill set obsolete so you don&#39;t have to spend money on those people anymore. The only question is if it&#39;ll work to the extent that some people think.<br /><br />To &quot;hate&quot; someone for having these concerns only tells me that you completely lack empathy.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Of course it&#39;s a natural reaction if you think that your livelihood is going to be affected.  But really, technology is ALWAYS changing.  If you aren&#39;t continuously developing your skills, eventually you&#39;ll be out of a job.  If the next major transition in networking is repeatable, scripted/reciped/etc. configurations, then you&#39;d better learn how to write those scripts/recipes.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">We use maintenance windows because not everything goes as planned. Not because we don&#39;t trust manual processes. Manual processes do cause a lot of issues. But no matter how many times we test something in the lab, they do occasionally fail. We do them in maintenance windows to reduce the risk that a failure would affect the business. Even if we had a hundred successful windows in a row, changes to business systems will happen off-hours. Automated or not. This isn&#39;t old-thinking, it&#39;s reality. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">Nice and very illustrative article.<br /><br />And agrede with Amanda,,, I feel that exciting challenges and opportunities are coming, and if we think that all we can contribute as NW engineers is configure ports and VLANs, then we have a real problem... I would expect that we can provide much more value than simply memorise  a set of commands and then blindly repeat them.. We understand how complex computer systems communicate and the challenges they present... And is up to us to keep learning and evolving,,, that is the fun part, isn&#39;t it?<br /><br />I don&#39;t know... but I think that to reduce the SDN wave to a debate around NW engineers versus programmer profiles (or OMG! I&#39;m going to be replaced by a script!) is a bit simplistic and underestimate ourselves.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I definitely found this idea interesting...I have started really liking the idea of network virtualization for allowing increased network automation, but it obviously has limits (what about the enterprise WAN, service providers, underlying physical devices in the DC).<br /><br />The above would make a commit/rollback mechanism more important in the network (just as in a database).  <br /><br />You could also probably still leverage virtual environments for some of your testing i.e. test changes in a part virtual/part physical environment.<br /><br />Also we need standardization of some of these programming interfaces so that we can write code that can work relatively easily across multiple vendors (maybe OVSDB?...need to look into this more).</div>
