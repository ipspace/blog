  html: Nice post and great suggested solution. Just want to clarify that the C3160
    isn&#39;t supported with UCS Mini today. The C240 M3 is, up to seven, with 48TB
    raw storage.<br /><br />Disclosure - I&#39;m the Cisco Sr. Marketing Manager working
    on UCS Mini.

  html: VSAN aggregates local attached disks either with a HBA controller in pass-through
    (aka IT mode) or RAID adapter in RAID0 mode (aka JBOD mode).<br /><br />Anyway,
    a minimum of one SSD + one HDD is required.<br /><br />Therefore I doubt if ever
    this UCS mini will make it into VSAN HCL in the current state... Maybe in an all-flash
    VSAN version though but this is only speculation :)<br /><br />

  html: I think VSAN is not a right option in that case. For VSAN we need at least
    3 (or better 4) rack server nodes. And also we need to license all our blade servers
    in order to access the VSAN cluster.<br />It will be really expansive solution.<br
    /><br />IMHO the best option here is to buy any NFS/iSCSI storage. Thus we&#39;ll
    get a modified version of FlexPod/VSPEX architecture - FlexPod-mini/VSPEX-mini
    :).<br /><br />And of course we always have an option with OpenStack + Swift/Ceph.

  html: There are rumors of fitting UCS Invicta (former Whiptail) within UCS chassis.
    24T RAW SSD storage sounds nice so close to servers.
