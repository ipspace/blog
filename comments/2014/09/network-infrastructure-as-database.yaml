    html: Yes, being worried about how you are going to provide for your family in
      the future when it seems that the skills you&#39;ve spent 10 years building
      aren&#39;t needed anymore is completely unnatural. They should probably just
      fire themselves right now. /sarcasm.<br /><br />The goal of &quot;SDN&quot;
      isn&#39;t to make life easier or &quot;empower the network engineer&quot; to
      do other things than to create vlans. While that is part of it, the goal is
      to make the skill set obsolete so you don&#39;t have to spend money on those
      people anymore. The only question is if it&#39;ll work to the extent that some
      people think.<br /><br />To &quot;hate&quot; someone for having these concerns
      only tells me that you completely lack empathy.

    html: Of course it&#39;s a natural reaction if you think that your livelihood
      is going to be affected.  But really, technology is ALWAYS changing.  If you
      aren&#39;t continuously developing your skills, eventually you&#39;ll be out
      of a job.  If the next major transition in networking is repeatable, scripted/reciped/etc.
      configurations, then you&#39;d better learn how to write those scripts/recipes.

  html: I won&#39;t have a job if everything is automated! I really hate this one.
    I also hate when it isn&#39;t verbalized, but you see the wheels turning and coming
    to this conclusion inappropriately. Perhaps those folks shouldn&#39;t have a job
    if they don&#39;t see the advantages.

    html: And how come the virtualization admins can create a new VM, new port group,
      or a new LUN or shared file system at any time?

    html: I don&#39;t think all of those are equal and a well managed shop won&#39;t
      have admins doing things at any time.<br /><br />A new VM could drive a host
      over the edge resource wise, a new LUN could be placed in the wrong place overloading
      a SAN and causing performance issues for a critical application.

  html: 'We use maintenance windows because not everything goes as planned. Not because
    we don&#39;t trust manual processes. Manual processes do cause a lot of issues.
    But no matter how many times we test something in the lab, they do occasionally
    fail. We do them in maintenance windows to reduce the risk that a failure would
    affect the business. Even if we had a hundred successful windows in a row, changes
    to business systems will happen off-hours. Automated or not. This isn&#39;t old-thinking,
    it&#39;s reality. '

  html: I can&#39;t believe ppl are worried about job security and threatened by automation?  I
    for one can think of more creative ways to flex my brain cells than configuring
    access ports. VLANs etc..  I want to be freed up from the  error prone CLI mashing
    to actually get a chance to learn new skills like Openstack and SDN

  html: Nice and very illustrative article.<br /><br />And agrede with Amanda,,, I
    feel that exciting challenges and opportunities are coming, and if we think that
    all we can contribute as NW engineers is configure ports and VLANs, then we have
    a real problem... I would expect that we can provide much more value than simply
    memorise  a set of commands and then blindly repeat them.. We understand how complex
    computer systems communicate and the challenges they present... And is up to us
    to keep learning and evolving,,, that is the fun part, isn&#39;t it?<br /><br
    />I don&#39;t know... but I think that to reduce the SDN wave to a debate around
    NW engineers versus programmer profiles (or OMG! I&#39;m going to be replaced
    by a script!) is a bit simplistic and underestimate ourselves.

  html: Some of the points you make, particularly about transactions reminds me of
    the  Clark Wilson Integrity model. <br /><br />http://theory.stanford.edu/~ninghui/courses/Fall03/papers/clark_wilson.pdf<br

  html: I definitely found this idea interesting...I have started really liking the
    idea of network virtualization for allowing increased network automation, but
    it obviously has limits (what about the enterprise WAN, service providers, underlying
    physical devices in the DC).<br /><br />The above would make a commit/rollback
    mechanism more important in the network (just as in a database).  <br /><br />You
    could also probably still leverage virtual environments for some of your testing
    i.e. test changes in a part virtual/part physical environment.<br /><br />Also
    we need standardization of some of these programming interfaces so that we can
    write code that can work relatively easily across multiple vendors (maybe OVSDB?...need
    to look into this more).
