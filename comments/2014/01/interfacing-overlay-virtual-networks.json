It&#39;s nice to hear that you&#39;re working on ESXi support (btw, you might want to mention that you work for Nuage), but the press release you quote doesn&#39;t mention vSphere, VMware or ESX, and is thus totally irrelevant to the technical audience of this blog ;)<br /><br />Finally, it seems your products are moving in the right direction, and I would definitely consider writing about them ... as soon as I get my hands on shipping product documentation (hint, hint).<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Ivan",

Unfortunately there are few public sources on Nuage for a technical audience like yours, I&#39;m hoping we can change that soon. In the mean time your comment made me realize that perhaps we aren&#39;t as clear on what we are doing as we should be. The link was intended as some form of proof that it&#39;s not just me saying this; perhaps I should have used https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9iDUm07_Zo which shows Nuage VSP integration with VMWare about 20 minutes into the demo.",
