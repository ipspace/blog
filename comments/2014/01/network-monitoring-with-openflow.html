            <div class="comment-content">Ivan, I enjoyed the video and use cases. However, OpenFlow has issues as a network monitoring technology when you try to scale up the solutions. The use of sampling makes sFlow extremely scaleability and provides low-latency measurements that are complementary to OpenFlow&#39;s ability to capture specific flows and apply active controls. Combining the two technologies lets you build extremely scaleable SDN traffic monitoring and control systems.<br /><br />The following talk describes the challenges of building measurement driven SDN solutions and discusses a number of use cases:<br /><br />http://blog.sflow.com/2013/06/bay-area-network-virtualization-talk.html<br /><br /></div>
