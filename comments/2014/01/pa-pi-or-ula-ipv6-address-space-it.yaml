  html: Thanks again for this instructive article.<br />It brought me some side thoughts
    on the recent trends in networking.<br /><br />I used to be a network engineer.
    I haven&#39;t worked in the field for a few years (I now work in security), but
    I am trying to maintain some knowledge reading articles all around, like the great
    ones you regularly provide.<br />So maybe my points are biased by my lack of skills.<br
    /><br />However, from my perspective and with some hindsight, I am stunned by
    the complexity brought by virtualization and, mostly, IPv6.<br /><br />Yes, all
    that is extrimely powerful and flexible. But did we really need that? Will the
    administrators really understand the stuff?<br />I am myself having hard times
    to catch up and I am often getting lost in all this mess.<br /><br />I see daily
    configuration errors and misunderstanding on much more basic and old concepts...
    I mean simple IPv4 subnetting, NAT, routing, etc.<br />So I am really doubting
    more and more on the chances of IPv6 in adoption, reliability and security in
    real world implementations.<br /><br />We are far from the sane &quot;keep it
    simple&quot; principle, often praised to achieve good design... As a security
    guy, I am really scared.

    html: Currently it doesn&#39;t seem like anyone plans to implement any region-based
      address filters (they wouldn&#39;t work anyway), so you could get a large allocation
      from RIPE and be done with it.<br /><br />You MIGHT want to get smaller allocations
      from other RIRs just to be on the safe side.

    html: Thanks! We have a long way to go before pulling the trigger on this, but
      I&#39;m trying to get my mind wrapped around it. We&#39;ll bring someone like
      you (maybe you!) inside to look at the details before making such a huge decision,
      I&#39;m sure.

  html: Can you give any free advice on where a large multinational company should
    get its PI range? <br />My company is based in a RIPE region, but has almost equal
    presence throughout the world. We could get a large allocation from RIPE, or a
    smaller one from RIPE, one from ARIN, etc...

  html: Aww, c&#39;mon Ivan -- everyone knows the answer is IPv6 site-local addresses.  <br

  html: Hi Ivan, Hi Jason,<br /><br />I just wrote a blogpost discussing some aspects
    of your question, Jason. It can be found here:<br />http://www.insinuator.net/2014/01/ipv6-address-plan-considerations-part-2-the-pi-space-from-singlemultiple-rirs-debate/.<br

  html: Not a great solution, but a workable one:<br /><br /> - accept the fact that
    enterprise is going to be stuck with legacy IPv4 for far longer than the rest
    of the Internet<br /> <br /> - use MAP-T with one translation gateway per service
    provider; MAP (translate) the enterprise&#39;s RC1918 IPv4 to the appropriate
    service provider&#39;s public IPv6 on each gateway<br /> <br /> - for native v6,
    you&#39;re still stuck in the boat as most enterprises won&#39;t bother figuring
    out what ULA is &amp; applying for it until it&#39;s far too late.  However, at
    least with the plethora of unique IPv6 addresses you can do stateless 1:1 NAT
    on one of the gateways &amp; not worry about it too much.
