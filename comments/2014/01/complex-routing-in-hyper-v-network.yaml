    html: From my perspective they did exactly the right thing ;) Or would you claim
      that Amazon VPC sucks as well?

    html: 'I am wondering how well this will scale with all these host routes for
      every connected VM. And what if there is an issue with the &quot;allmighty&quot;
      single v-switch/router? I don&#39;t trust this design. Call me old fashioned,
      but I&#39;d rather have clear network boundaries with routing between the segments.
      Plus, what you said about security. '

    html: 'As Ivan points out, AWS VPC is comparable.  A single AWS VPC scales to
      a full /16 worth of network.  I&#39;m not sure you&#39;d run to that scale in
      Hyper-V, but it seems possible if well designed and if you had the right hardware.<br
      />Also, nothing stops you from having more than one router running a FHRP in
      the virtual environment. Or from having another redundancy strategy.  You should
      check out AWS&#39;s redundant NAT Instance design as an example of what kind
      of things you can do.  And as far as security is concerned, again, nothing stops
      you from implementing a whole security stack in the virtual environment.  '

    html: 'all right, all right. I stand corrected. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t talk about
      things I have no experience with (Hyper-V) :-)   '

  html: Lately, what i have been undestanding from various virutalization solution
    is that there is no concept of L2 or L3 tables like what one observes in physical
    world. There is either just one table (route table) or max two tables (ARP table
    and route table) for both inter-subnet and intra-subnet. This means that intra-subnet
    is also subject to routing lookup. As every thing is done is software, each vendor
    implement different tricks. For example, HNV does a routing lookup for intra-subnet
    but maintains the semantics of Tradiitional L2 like no-mac rewrite, no TTL reduction
    etc. Open-contrail uses vRouter for intra-subnet &amp; inter-subnet but does not
    reduce the TTL at all. I believe NSX DRS uses both DRS &amp; VDS which is similar
    to traditional routing-switching model<br />
