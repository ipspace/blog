Unicast RPF will also work on links to Internet exchange points (IXPs). <br />What does not work in the uRPF original \u201cstrict mode\u201d implementation is if uRPF is applied on routers with multiple connections to multiple ISPs.&quot;: http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/urpf.pdf",

This option is not supported on IoS (last time I checked), but it is supported on other platforms (e.g Junos). Feasible path uRPF will discard the packet unless *a* route (not necessarily the best) to the source address is through the interface on which the packet was received. For loose, the route just has to exist. The inbound interface is not considered. ",
