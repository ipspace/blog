      "html": "Nuage VSP uses a logically separate TCP/TLS OpenFlow connection from OVS to the SDN controller, but it shares the same physical link(s) as the data traffic. This fate sharing allows the controller to detect problems with the data plane forwarding ( e.g. link failures ). It also leaves you free to buy servers with as few or as many NICs as you prefer - this is an example of what we mean by &quot;unconstrained networking&quot;.",
