  html: Ivan, I enjoyed the video and use cases. However, OpenFlow has issues as a
    network monitoring technology when you try to scale up the solutions. The use
    of sampling makes sFlow extremely scaleability and provides low-latency measurements
    that are complementary to OpenFlow&#39;s ability to capture specific flows and
    apply active controls. Combining the two technologies lets you build extremely
    scaleable SDN traffic monitoring and control systems.<br /><br />The following
    talk describes the challenges of building measurement driven SDN solutions and
    discusses a number of use cases:<br /><br />http://blog.sflow.com/2013/06/bay-area-network-virtualization-talk.html<br
