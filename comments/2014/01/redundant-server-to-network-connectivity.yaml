    html: While my inner networking geek agrees with you (and I was proposing this
      very idea in at least one blog post), the harsh reality disagrees with us:<br
      /><br />A) You&#39;d lose the summarization property of IP subnets, which might
      haunt you in very large networks;<br /><br />B) I don&#39;t think the network
      or server admins would be happy to run a routing protocol (apart from BGP) between
      servers and routers.<br /><br />As for BGP, at least one of my customers runs
      BGP between server loopback and L3 switches ... have to write about that one
      day.

  html: In an overlay virtual networking environment, where the hypervisor sends all
    traffic from a single IP address, why not do L3 all the way through, and treat
    each server as a router, and use the router loopback address as the endpoint IP
    for tunnels?
