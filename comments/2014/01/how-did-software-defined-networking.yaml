  html: So, where did the &quot;Software-Defined&quot; meme come from? I think Software-Defined
    Radio (SDR) was first, then &quot;SDN&quot; was introduced.  Now we have Software-Defined
    Storage, the Software-Defined Data Center etc. etc.

  html: "&quot;You did notice the \u201Ca sort of\u201D classification and quotes\
    \ around SDN, didn\u2019t you? It\u2019s pretty obvious how the article uses \u201C\
    software-defined networking\u201D to illustrate the point...&quot;<br /><br />The\
    \ TR article was written by a journalist. At about the same time, McKeown gave\
    \ a talk at IEEE Infocom with Software Defined Networking[1] as the title. So\
    \ it wasn&#39;t just a phrase used to illustrate a point. He was  using the term\
    \ to describe what they wanted to accomplish with openflow. <br /><br />1. http://yuba.stanford.edu/~nickm/talks/infocom_brazil_2009_v1-1.pdf"

  html: As an early-mid career network engineer I hate the term &quot;software defined
    networking&quot; because it implies that the software folks will be ruling / controlling
    the network.  OpenFlow is an application that runs on top of a pre-existing network.  The
    chicken can&#39;t define the egg from which it hatched.  &quot;SDN&quot; gives
    software guys the idea that they can put on a network hat and take over the job
    of us slow network engineers.  Most network engineers I&#39;ve met were former
    application programmers who entered networking for the challenge (i.e. C/C++/Java
    got boring).  If only we could create an NDS movement - Network Defined Software
    :)  And haven&#39;t all networks from the beginning of silicon time been software
    defined; the software being IOS, Baystack, NIC drivers, etc?<br /><br />Personally
    I don&#39;t want my router/switch to be bossed around by a dictator controller
    no matter who is doing the central programming.  If the controller gets hacked
    or fails your whole network is dead.  I want my router/switch to be able to think
    independently and react appropriately to changes in network conditions.
