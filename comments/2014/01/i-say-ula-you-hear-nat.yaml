  html: 'How many IP addresses we will see on server&#39;s NIC, One for link local,
    one Global unicast range, one ULA and one IPv4 address for backward comaptibility.
    It is operational nighmare. '

  html: I suspect that having multiple ULA for internal company communication and
    global for communication with the Intenet will cause lots of issues with application
    guys since now application has to bind to specific ip for internal communications
    and another ip to go to the internet. I see many server guys now have very fuzzy
    understanding of the windows or unix/linux networking so ULA and global will make
    life a nightmare.<br /><br />many companies use NAT for traffic engineering purposes
    (especially customer/vendor extranets) and it&#39;s easier to  NAT traffic to
    make it going the way you want than setting up PBR all over the place. <br /><br
    />We all know about dark messy corners of the corporate networks, NAT may be the
    simplest solution to make things done (adding more mess though but that&#39;s
    another story, we need to get things done and may not have time to redesign existing
    infrastructure.<br /><br />I am sure that customers will push vendors to implement
    NAT66 because they need/want it and it will be done regardless if IETF thinks
    it&#39;s ok or not. <br />

  html: Ivan, great blog post. I agree with your thoughts on ULA and Global Unicast
    and you could certainly run ULA for your corporate connection requirements and
    use Global Unicast from either PI or PA for each site. I was trying to address
    more of the BGP multihomed corporate office with a remote branch off that doesn&#39;t
    do BGP. I think both solutions would work, yours might be a better design long
    term - go figure, you are smarter than me ;)<br />In regards to Dmitriy&#39;s
    comments about application guys having to bind to specific IP&#39;s for internal.
    If the OS is following RFC 6724 then applications will benefit from being passed
    the correct information for source/destination selection and will get an ordered
    list. This problem is no different for IPv4 hosts that have multiple IPv4 addresses,
    there has to be some sort of logic to pick one verse the other. Someone has to
    make a decision about what IP address to bind to or just bind to them all and
    reserve a port instead. I disagree with his comments about NAT and PBR. I believe
    the current IPv4 solution puts many artificial restrictions on redundancy, path
    selection and artificially imposes restrictions on having to pass through stateful
    devices. IPv6 gives companies enough addresses but also network prefixes to not
    have to worry about NAT. This allows you to truly have global and universal firewall
    rules that are not concerned with things like did the source traffic come as RFC
    1918 or the real IPv4 address etc.<br />Finally, I guess we also need to decide,
    is it NPT66 or NPTv6 - I was using the name from the RFC (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6296)
    but I have seen you and several others say NPT66 instead. I guess I will update
    my post to tell folks you might see it referenced either way for now.<br />- Ed<br
