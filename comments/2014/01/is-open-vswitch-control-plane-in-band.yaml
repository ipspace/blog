  html: Nuage VSP uses a logically separate TCP/TLS OpenFlow connection from OVS to
    the SDN controller, but it shares the same physical link(s) as the data traffic.
    This fate sharing allows the controller to detect problems with the data plane
    forwarding ( e.g. link failures ). It also leaves you free to buy servers with
    as few or as many NICs as you prefer - this is an example of what we mean by &quot;unconstrained
    networking&quot;.
