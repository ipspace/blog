    html: Thanks for the link. Definitely an interesting document, and I love the
      pseudocode on page 7, but it defines &quot;loose mode&quot; uRPF that I already
      mentioned in the article, so it was an enhancement 8 years ago when the document
      was published, but is old news by now.

  html: "Interesting article, as always Ivan.<br /><br />uRPF has been enhanced though:\
    \ &quot;It will also work if the customer is multihomed to the ISP or multiple\
    \ ISPs. Unicast RPF will also work on links to Internet exchange points (IXPs).\
    \ <br />What does not work in the uRPF original \u201Cstrict mode\u201D implementation\
    \ is if uRPF is applied on routers with multiple connections to multiple ISPs.&quot;:\

  html: 'Hi Ivan, <br />i would mention that is important to stress the importance/availability
    of uRPF for IPv6 (it is not always available from all vendors). '

  html: Even with uRPF in loose mode if you route a block to Null0 it will still Null
    route it.  This makes Source based Real Time Blacking Listing work even in loose
    mode.  Being able to block inbound abuse without having to modify ACLs has been
    very useful to me.<br /><br />http://packetlife.net/blog/2010/aug/23/source-based-rtbh/

  html: 'There is also Feasible path uRPF, which is a good compromise between strict
    and loose. This option is not supported on IoS (last time I checked), but it is
    supported on other platforms (e.g Junos). Feasible path uRPF will discard the
    packet unless *a* route (not necessarily the best) to the source address is through
    the interface on which the packet was received. For loose, the route just has
    to exist. The inbound interface is not considered. '

  html: I run across issues with this almost every month or two, with XYZ provider/ISP
    running uRPF and not really understanding the problems it can bring. Asymmetric
    routing breaks it and then they wonder why customers complain about not being
    able to get to stuff.

  html: As Brian suggests, loose uRPF can be helpfull to block DOS attacks on your
    network. By enabling uRPF on all your upstream links, you can use Null routes
    to stop traffic at the edge of your netwerk.
