      "html": "Thanks again for this instructive article.<br />It brought me some side thoughts on the recent trends in networking.<br /><br />I used to be a network engineer. I haven&#39;t worked in the field for a few years (I now work in security), but I am trying to maintain some knowledge reading articles all around, like the great ones you regularly provide.<br />So maybe my points are biased by my lack of skills.<br /><br />However, from my perspective and with some hindsight, I am stunned by the complexity brought by virtualization and, mostly, IPv6.<br /><br />Yes, all that is extrimely powerful and flexible. But did we really need that? Will the administrators really understand the stuff?<br />I am myself having hard times to catch up and I am often getting lost in all this mess.<br /><br />I see daily configuration errors and misunderstanding on much more basic and old concepts... I mean simple IPv4 subnetting, NAT, routing, etc.<br />So I am really doubting more and more on the chances of IPv6 in adoption, reliability and security in real world implementations.<br /><br />We are far from the sane &quot;keep it simple&quot; principle, often praised to achieve good design... As a security guy, I am really scared.",

However, at least with the plethora of unique IPv6 addresses you can do stateless 1:1 NAT on one of the gateways &amp; not worry about it too much.",
