          "html": "I am wondering how well this will scale with all these host routes for every connected VM. And what if there is an issue with the &quot;allmighty&quot; single v-switch/router? I don&#39;t trust this design. Call me old fashioned, but I&#39;d rather have clear network boundaries with routing between the segments. Plus, what you said about security. ",

          "html": "As Ivan points out, AWS VPC is comparable.  A single AWS VPC scales to a full /16 worth of network.  I&#39;m not sure you&#39;d run to that scale in Hyper-V, but it seems possible if well designed and if you had the right hardware.<br />Also, nothing stops you from having more than one router running a FHRP in the virtual environment. Or from having another redundancy strategy.  You should check out AWS&#39;s redundant NAT Instance design as an example of what kind of things you can do.  And as far as security is concerned, again, nothing stops you from implementing a whole security stack in the virtual environment.  ",

      "html": "Lately, what i have been undestanding from various virutalization solution is that there is no concept of L2 or L3 tables like what one observes in physical world. There is either just one table (route table) or max two tables (ARP table and route table) for both inter-subnet and intra-subnet. This means that intra-subnet is also subject to routing lookup. As every thing is done is software, each vendor implement different tricks. For example, HNV does a routing lookup for intra-subnet but maintains the semantics of Tradiitional L2 like no-mac rewrite, no TTL reduction etc. Open-contrail uses vRouter for intra-subnet &amp; inter-subnet but does not reduce the TTL at all. I believe NSX DRS uses both DRS &amp; VDS which is similar to traditional routing-switching model<br />",
