            <p class="comment-content">So, where did the &quot;Software-Defined&quot; meme come from? I think Software-Defined Radio (SDR) was first, then &quot;SDN&quot; was introduced.  Now we have Software-Defined Storage, the Software-Defined Data Center etc. etc.</p>

            <p class="comment-content">&quot;You did notice the “a sort of” classification and quotes around SDN, didn’t you? It’s pretty obvious how the article uses “software-defined networking” to illustrate the point...&quot;<br /><br />The TR article was written by a journalist. At about the same time, McKeown gave a talk at IEEE Infocom with Software Defined Networking[1] as the title. So it wasn&#39;t just a phrase used to illustrate a point. He was  using the term to describe what they wanted to accomplish with openflow. <br /><br />1. http://yuba.stanford.edu/~nickm/talks/infocom_brazil_2009_v1-1.pdf</p>

            <p class="comment-content">As an early-mid career network engineer I hate the term &quot;software defined networking&quot; because it implies that the software folks will be ruling / controlling the network.  OpenFlow is an application that runs on top of a pre-existing network.  The chicken can&#39;t define the egg from which it hatched.  &quot;SDN&quot; gives software guys the idea that they can put on a network hat and take over the job of us slow network engineers.  Most network engineers I&#39;ve met were former application programmers who entered networking for the challenge (i.e. C/C++/Java got boring).  If only we could create an NDS movement - Network Defined Software :)  And haven&#39;t all networks from the beginning of silicon time been software defined; the software being IOS, Baystack, NIC drivers, etc?<br /><br />Personally I don&#39;t want my router/switch to be bossed around by a dictator controller no matter who is doing the central programming.  If the controller gets hacked or fails your whole network is dead.  I want my router/switch to be able to think independently and react appropriately to changes in network conditions.</p>
