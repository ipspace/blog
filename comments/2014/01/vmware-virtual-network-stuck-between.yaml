  html: Should it be concerning that the first &quot;What&#39;s New&quot; item listed
    in the vCNS 5.5 release notes is something designed to help you with kernel crashes?

  html: Hi Ivan, about the ridiculous pricing and licensing rumors. I can confirm
    that the default pricing is ridiculous but VMware are very open to talk because
    i think they are trying to find the right pricepoint.  The worst about the licensing
    model is that you DONT get vspp atm, so no help on growing your partner status....
