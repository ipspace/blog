    html: Hi Jeroen,<br /><br />Thanks for the comment. It&#39;s nice to hear that
      you&#39;re working on ESXi support (btw, you might want to mention that you
      work for Nuage), but the press release you quote doesn&#39;t mention vSphere,
      VMware or ESX, and is thus totally irrelevant to the technical audience of this
      blog ;)<br /><br />Finally, it seems your products are moving in the right direction,
      and I would definitely consider writing about them ... as soon as I get my hands
      on shipping product documentation (hint, hint).<br /><br />Kind regards,<br
      />Ivan

    html: Hi Ivan,<br />Indeed I work for Nuage, something I take for granted - but
      you are right, I could have mentioned it explicitly. Unfortunately there are
      few public sources on Nuage for a technical audience like yours, I&#39;m hoping
      we can change that soon. In the mean time your comment made me realize that
      perhaps we aren&#39;t as clear on what we are doing as we should be. The link
      was intended as some form of proof that it&#39;s not just me saying this; perhaps
      I should have used https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9iDUm07_Zo which shows Nuage
      VSP integration with VMWare about 20 minutes into the demo.

  html: 'Besides Linux-based hyper-visors like KVM and Xen, Nuage VSP also supports
    VMWare ESXi as hyper-visor, and integrates with vCenter. This is what UPMC is
    using as was announced yesterday: http://www.nuagenetworks.net/press-releases/upmc-selects-nuage-networks/'

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Thanks for listing out all the options that are available.<br
    /><br />Is it not that &quot;Direct integration with MPLS/VPN infrastructure&quot;
    seems a better approach for Inter-DC &amp; Hybrid cloud cases ?. This solution
    seems like a HW based, removes L2 scaliability, VLAN scalability &amp; VLAN provising
    issue ?<br /><br />-Bhargav

  html: 'Nuage solution also supports direct integration with MPLS/VPN using VXLAN  encapsulation
    to pass IP traffic between hypervisor hosts and PE-routers. VXLAN can be terminated
    directly into VPLS or IPVPN service on  ALU SR7750  router. EVPN used as a control
    plane in this case. XMPP for service provisioning '

    html: You can definitely do EVPN to MPLS/VPN integration (on Nexus 7x00 IIRC),
      not sure about ACI-to-MPLS/VPN.
