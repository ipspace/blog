            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br />The costs of public cloud resources are falling however, in a race to zero.  If you make bad decisions in how you use the public cloud, it&#39;s going to cost you.  That&#39;s no different than bad decisions with a private cloud.  I&#39;d be willing to bet this client is using On Demand instances everywhere and not using the 10x cost savings of Spot Instances wherever possible.<br />At any rate, I don&#39;t see the problem with being locked-in with an industry leader and falling prices.  Be it public or private cloud.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Brad</div>

            <div class="comment-content">you would undoubtedly not be surprised at the number of developers coding database connection strings into the source instead of using proper methods like ODBC. Almost every C.O.T.S. application i&#39;ve ever encountered is shackled in that way.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">You can only successfully replace a service with another service when the new service provides the same capabilities you use from the old.  The idea that one service provider is too-expensive has to be based on getting equivalent services from someone else for less.   Getting less for less is easy... getting the same for less, not so easy.  You have to be sure what you&#39;re getting into before selling people on the &quot;I can do it for less&quot; idea.  It isn&#39;t in any cloud provider&#39;s interest to offer exactly what another provider offers, because that just leaves price as the only leverage -- and nobody wins in a price war because eventually the price becomes unsustainable.  So they differentiate in service... and as soon as you leverage that difference, you have lock-in on that provider&#39;s service.<br /><br />There is no magic in Cloud... you&#39;re either a professional who recognises their responsibilities in making things work, or you&#39;re a spectator in the audience watching the show.   There&#39;s no room for spectators up on the stage.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&quot;There is no magic in Cloud... &quot; is exactly right. Users have such little comprehension on how the cloud works and with the rampant &#39;cloudwashing&#39; going on it isn&#39;t hard to see why. Cloud has the potential to improve efficiency and productivity whilst cutting costs but it is not the golden goose- you can&#39;t take potential to the bank and managers are getting increasingly frustrated when realising this reality. Cloud is not a one size fits all and when company execs realise this then they are better equipped for a migration that would best suit their needs.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.cloudwedge.com/cloud-storage-reviews/mypc-backup-review/" rel="nofollow"> MPC</a></div>
