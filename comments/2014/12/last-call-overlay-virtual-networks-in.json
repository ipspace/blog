If you ever registered for any of my webinars (even the free ones), you can use that email address to log in. <br /><br />All I need is some user identification to watermark the copy, and I have no intention wasting my time creating yet another &quot;register here for your free copy&quot; form.",

      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />I think it is very generous to give free access to your book and I&#39;m really willing to read it as I like very much your blog and all the usefull info you provide. The only thing anoying is that I need to be registered and need a google account (which I don&#39;t have) to access it... which make me think to one of your article (there you see that I&#39;m a regular reader :-) ) http://blog.ipspace.net/2010/09/hiding-documentation-will-they-never.html<br />Do you think it is possible to get the book without a google account?<br /><br />Thanks a lot,<br /><br />JF",
