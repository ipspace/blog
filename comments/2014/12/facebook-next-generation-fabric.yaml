    hard to follow those lines.

  html: 'It is very interesting to see this physical topology being used in an actual
    datacenter deployment. While a traditional leaf and spline network employs a 2-level
    folded-Clos topology, this is a 3-level folded-Clos topology. It resembles an
    undirected butterfly network, which mathematically is denoted as a k-ary n-fly
    network, with k the switch semi-radix (half the port count, or number of uplinks
    or downlinks) and n the number of stages. In the case of the Facebook proposal,
    they design for n=3 and k=48, although they admit variations to increase capacity
    (starting from a smaller design). Interestingly, the path diversity of this topology
    equals the number of core switches -up to 48 in Facebook&#39;s design- so it tolerates
    multiple switch losses with graceful performance degradation (although ECMP load
    balancing mechanisms typically work best with power-of-2 number of paths, so they
    could result in larger degradation due to load unbalance).<br /><br />This type
    of topology has been used before in HPC systems. For example, the BBN Butterfly
    system already employed a multistage interconnection network in the early 80&#39;s
    (using 4x4 switches and Motorola 68000 processors!!). In these multi-stage interconnection
    networks (MINs) the maximum number of endpoints with full-bisection bandwidth
    (i.e. statistically non-blocking) grows exponentially with the number of stages,
    something like k^n, which is larger than 100.000 for k=48 and n=3. Considering
    today&#39;s large switches, such arrangements will be only required for very large
    systems from very large companies, such as this example from Facebook. <br /><br
    />There is plenty of academic information about Clos networks in the literature;

    rel="nofollow">This book</a> by Bill Dally (Chief Scientist in Nvidia) considers
    MINs and has a section about multi-level Clos and Butterflies. '

    html: Thanks. The new QFX5100 Series book also has a chapter on just IP Fabrics
      showing different options such as 3-stage and 5-stage topologies. <br /><br
      />I also posted a white paper on how to build these networks using BGP.<br /><br
      />http://www.juniper.net/us/en/local/pdf/whitepapers/2000565-en.pdf<br /><br
      />Juniper also has an open source project called OpenClos which automates the
      creation of these networks.<br /><br />https://github.com/Juniper/OpenClos

  html: 'Oops accidentally deleted my post.  Thanks for the Google presentation, I&#39;ve
    seen something like this multiple times really.   It&#39;s not new in the HPC
    world at all.   <br /><br />Doug Hanks from Juniper did a NANOG presentation,
    and there is a good section in the new QFX5100 book about doing something similar
    except using Juniper&#39;s VCF to make one of the tiers look like a single switch.  Of
    course you are limited by what the VCF protocols/management can do whereas this
    is just based on number of available ports. '
