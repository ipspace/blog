      "html": "It is very interesting to see this physical topology being used in an actual datacenter deployment. While a traditional leaf and spline network employs a 2-level folded-Clos topology, this is a 3-level folded-Clos topology. It resembles an undirected butterfly network, which mathematically is denoted as a k-ary n-fly network, with k the switch semi-radix (half the port count, or number of uplinks or downlinks) and n the number of stages. In the case of the Facebook proposal, they design for n=3 and k=48, although they admit variations to increase capacity (starting from a smaller design). Interestingly, the path diversity of this topology equals the number of core switches -up to 48 in Facebook&#39;s design- so it tolerates multiple switch losses with graceful performance degradation (although ECMP load balancing mechanisms typically work best with power-of-2 number of paths, so they could result in larger degradation due to load unbalance).<br /><br />This type of topology has been used before in HPC systems. For example, the BBN Butterfly system already employed a multistage interconnection network in the early 80&#39;s (using 4x4 switches and Motorola 68000 processors!!). In these multi-stage interconnection networks (MINs) the maximum number of endpoints with full-bisection bandwidth (i.e. statistically non-blocking) grows exponentially with the number of stages, something like k^n, which is larger than 100.000 for k=48 and n=3. Considering today&#39;s large switches, such arrangements will be only required for very large systems from very large companies, such as this example from Facebook. <br /><br />There is plenty of academic information about Clos networks in the literature; <a href=\"http://store.elsevier.com/Principles-and-Practices-of-Interconnection-Networks/William-Dally/isbn-9780080497808/\" rel=\"nofollow\">This book</a> by Bill Dally (Chief Scientist in Nvidia) considers MINs and has a section about multi-level Clos and Butterflies.

It&#39;s not new in the HPC world at all.   <br /><br />Doug Hanks from Juniper did a NANOG presentation, and there is a good section in the new QFX5100 book about doing something similar except using Juniper&#39;s VCF to make one of the tiers look like a single switch.  Of course you are limited by what the VCF protocols/management can do whereas this is just based on number of available ports. ",
