  html: There are still savings to be realized from white label switches. Assuming
    your needs a fairly simple, a Cumulus-powered Dell switch is going to be far cheaper
    than a corresponding Cisco model.<br /><br />You talked about margin shifting
    and that&#39;s true. However, the CapEx on these &quot;dumb&quot; switches is
    far lower than any of the big vendors.
