    it turned out 2014 had only 12 months. Revised plan: Q1 2014.<br /><br />2015?'

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />Apart a few webinars that have been postponed early next
    year, I think we have to underline and congratulate you on the excellent job you&#39;re
    doing on your blog and your monthly available materials. It is really mandatory
    that somebody takes the time to depict every technology that we should work with
    in the next few days, months or years... and you&#39;re doing it so well!<br /><br
    />Warm congratulations!
