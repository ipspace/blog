Faulty transceivers and similar **** is what wakes you up at 2AM (rarely, but still). Oh, and then there are people using &quot;media converters&quot; ;) and LAG over Metro Ethernet (don&#39;t ask!). <br /><br />Finally, it&#39;s nice to be able to solve failure detection on all media using a consistent mechanism.",

Some implementations at some moments in time had very serious issues with BFD (BFD-based link state not propery propagated to all protocols, MPLS being the prime victim). OK, it was not Cisco and not Juniper.<br />2. Do people do LAG without LACP ? (OK, not the greatest protocol for removing bad links, but still effective)<br />3. Do people do LAG without &quot;seeing the light&quot; ? When you &quot;see the light&quot; (get the L1 signal sent from the other side - no Ethernet over SomethingElse) a number of issues disappear.<br /><br />What am I missing here ?",
