That said I&#39;d like to confirm that an increasing number of organizations consider NPTv6 as &quot;the way to go&quot; for small/medium sites with local Internet breakout requirements. So, yes, from what I can see real-life points into that direction.<br />btw: what is that LISP thing you mention? ;-)<br /><br />best<br /><br />Enno",
