            <div class="comment-content">Hi Ivan,<br />most of the nowadays web frameworks have their own ORMs which allow them to communicate with a few of the most popular databases. RoR has ActiveRecord, Sails has Waterline. These kind of abstractions allow you to migrate from NoSQL to SQL and back without modifying your code. However, as you&#39;d expect, they provide their own API to the application.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;m probably not going to be coherent but the difference that I see with a database versus a router is that when you make a change to a database (add table, delete table, insert row, etc ...) the change is confined to to the database system (except if there were reports or API&#39;s depending on those tables). When you make a change on the router it affects other peers and in fact the &quot;network&quot; or the algorithms that manage this distributed network are adapting or adjusting themselves in near real-time to the changes you are making.<br /><br />I think this dynamic adaption is the difference between networking and the rest of IT. In the rest of IT when things fail they fail hard, its easy to spot. When networking fails, it could fail hard or it could be hidden by these dynamic algorithms. <br /><br />Not sure if this non-determinism is good or bad, but from the perspective of other IT groups it looks like we are not in full control of our networks.<br /><br />Other than that I feel a lot more confident and less stressed having to enter commands into a DB CLI than a router CLI even in a lab environment.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Database changes are rarely confined to the database in any non-trivial IT infrastructure. They typically impact and require changes to ETL processes, data warehouses, integrations, web service APUs, etc. And these changes affect *persistent* valuable business data.<br /><br />In comparison, network changes impact only ephemeral data in flight, and rollback is easy.<br /><br />Networking just isn&#39;t that complicated compared with the hugely complex and varied application and data sectors of the industry. Which is why everyone gets pissed that netwoks are so slow to adapt, and so very fragile. I blame lack of competition and the cult of Cisco.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I stand corrected, in my previous post I fell for the Grass is always greener over the fence fallacy.<br /><br />Cult of Cisco I do agree but that was 1998-2013, future looks more interesting and diverse for networking now, hopefully.<br /><br />Maybe the problem is in the process, when a database change is made there is a project, consensus and everyone at the table, DBAs, system admins, systems analysts, developers, ETL specialists etc ...<br /><br />But in networking it seems people are left to their own devices, no one wants to get involved because networking seems like some black magic because although end to end connectivity seems like something so obviously simple they don&#39;t understand why its so complicated in practice. In my experience most technical people above the network layer and PMs gloss over networking and give it short consideration. </div>

            <div class="comment-content">Networking IS quite special (not necessarily in the good way), mostly because:<br />A. Quite a few people understand it (correctly; for some of them servers are part of the network).<br />B. Quite a few people see its importance/value.<br /><br />For databases, the value is quite clear : it holds data that makes the business work. Network (pretty much like electricity) is considered as &quot;just existing&quot; (and annoying). Did you never met people saying &quot;it&#39;s a network problem&quot; (when it&#39;s not) or &quot;isn&#39;t there some network issue ?&quot;, just because they are out of any other idea ? Or spending days to prove other people that it&#39;s NOT a network issue ?</div>
