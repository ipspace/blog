  html: Amen.<br /><br />It seems a lot of people in the network industry forget how
    dense an optimized virtual platform can be these days.<br /><br />Especially when
    you start to talk hyperconverged platforms (nutanix, evo:rail, simplicity etc)
    with integrated flash,  density increases again.<br /><br />Average company rack
    counts should be remaining static, or shrinking... If they optimize.<br /><br
    />Sadly, I&#39;ve seen a lot of orgs hang on to legacy and not consolidate anywhere
    near as much as is possible...<br /><br />So as always, it depends a lot on the
    people involved and how empowered they to a make positive changes.

  html: When you add network trafic + host vMotion + storage vMotion + usual storage
    trafic, it feels a bit dangerous to put 50 to 100 VMs per host on a 10 Gb link.<br
    /><br />For very high density, I feel it&#39;s easier to keep a separated storage
    network, and not have to deal with QoS, CEE &amp; co. But having 4 ToR per rack
    costs also a bit.<br />

  html: This is even more true in the Cisco world where your UCS FI&#39;s are acting
    as your server farm&#39;s access layer. And, if something insane happens and you
    really do need more physical ports, FEXes can attach to your TOR switches to add
    more ports with minimal expense or configuration work.

    html: Obviously it depends on your particular use case, but I have yet to see
      an enterprise environment with 4K VLANs, and in the IaaS provider environment
      you&#39;d use overlay encapsulation on the attached servers (so you&#39;d only
      need a single transport VLAN).

  html: Does it also mean as well that all we need is Vlan segmentation and not vxlan
    ? Do in such case 4096 Vlans enough ?

  html: All very well if your workload is compatible with running of the order of
    50 VM per server... and the bulk of systems is okay with being VMed. Perhaps that
    means I&#39;d be one of the few who raised their hands!
