  html: '&quot;Netconf [on Cisco] is like CLI with wrappers&quot; - That was largely
    true on Cisco&#39;s initial Netconf implementations.  But I thought some of the
    newer OSes (IOS-XR?) had a less CLI-centric and more &quot;data-centric&quot;/hierarchical
    approach to configuration, and provided a nicer mapping between configuration
    and XML.  But maybe that&#39;s just wishful thinking, as I haven&#39;t played
    with those implementations myself.'
