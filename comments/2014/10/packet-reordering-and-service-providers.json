This way we can avoid re-ordering as we make sure that merging point is reached by the previouse burst of the same flow.",

Modern Linux&#39;s, especially. <br /><br />Windows - even modern versions of windows - does it really badly. Redmond is asleep at the switch. ",

It forces re-ordering every 10 seconds, which kept latency low, and acted as a poor mans AQM, in it&#39;s own weird way. <br /><br />It&#39;s easy to see a misconfigured SFQ doing that if you have captures. 10 second period for the scrambling, under load.<br /><br />This dumb behavior in Linux&#39;s SFQ implementation was fixed around version 3.6, I believe, so periodic permutation no longer does that harm (but no longer acts as a poor man&#39;s AQM), but it will take a decade for that to sort itself out in the field.<br /><br />http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/Wondershaper_Must_Die",
