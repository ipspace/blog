  html: Seems to me that RFC2119 applies to life just like it does technology :)  There
    might be a reason you do something that is beneficial but you better be aware
    of the consequences.

  html: You may classify anything with these. Case in point, I would classify HFT
    as a bad idea... (High Frequency Trading).

  html: You MUST mention that a &quot;bad idea&quot; where the &quot;should document&quot;
    hasn&#39;t been documented turns into a &quot;really bad idea&quot; or sometimes
    even &quot;abomination&quot;.<br /><br />I must also mention that before accepting
    to implement a &quot;bad idea&quot; you MUST think about a way of getting rid
    of it, propose it even if it&#39;s known to be rejected (at this point you&#39;ve
    really done your job), and you SHOULD make people imposing it sign that they accept
    the implications and drawbacks (so that you can exhibit some bad will later, when
    things go wrong :) )
