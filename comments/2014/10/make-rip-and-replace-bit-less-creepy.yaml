  html: I used tape - one long piece for top row another for bottom row, made sure
    to push it together between each cable.  But Heath Robinson, but did the job.  Long
    time since I&#39;ve had to mess with cables myself though.

  html: The worst thing is not cables being unlabelled, the worst thing is cables
    being connected in a totally random order, without any description anywhere, coming
    from all directions and occasionally not having enough extra length to move it  a
    few cm right or left. Situation otherwise known as mess or disorder :)<br /><br
    />For people refusing to label cables there&#39;s &quot;PatchSee&quot;.<br />For
    everybody, there&#39;s &quot;documentation&quot; (if concept is known in the shop).

  html: That&#39;s a pretty neat idea! I&#39;ve always just used a fine point pen
    to write the port number on the patch lead.
