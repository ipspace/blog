    html: Hi Ofer,<br /><br />You are right, Cisco ASR 9000 implements RFC7130 support
      from IOS-XR 5.2.0.<br /><br />Fred

  html: Hi Ivan, <br />I don&#39;t think Cisco&#39;s implementation on both XR and
    NX-OS follows that RFC. it&#39;s a proprietary, not so efficient (to say the least),
    implementation...<br /><br />Juniper and ALU do have an RFC-compliant implementation
    though.<br /><br />Thanks

  html: According to the Release Notes, Cisco NX-OS 7.x supports &quot;Layer 2 Bidirectional
    Forwarding Detection&quot;.<br />I believe it might replace UDLD as a faster alternative
    to monitor the individual links in an LACP Port Channel.<br />I have not yet found
    out how to configure this feature, though. My N6K should support it.

    html: '#2 - Not all boxes support fast LACP (similar to BFD: if you can&#39;t
      execute it on the line card, you have serious scalability issues), so you&#39;re
      removing bad links in tens of seconds.<br /><br />#3 - &quot;Not seeing the
      light&quot; detects 99% of all the failures, but we&#39;re usually not worried
      about them (because we detect them). Faulty transceivers and similar **** is
      what wakes you up at 2AM (rarely, but still). Oh, and then there are people
      using &quot;media converters&quot; ;) and LAG over Metro Ethernet (don&#39;t
      ask!). <br /><br />Finally, it&#39;s nice to be able to solve failure detection
      on all media using a consistent mechanism.'

      do run some lag over lambda services and I&#39;ve seen failures both ways. <br

  html: Some random thoughts about BFD and LAG:<br />1. Some implementations at some
    moments in time had very serious issues with BFD (BFD-based link state not propery
    propagated to all protocols, MPLS being the prime victim). OK, it was not Cisco
    and not Juniper.<br />2. Do people do LAG without LACP ? (OK, not the greatest
    protocol for removing bad links, but still effective)<br />3. Do people do LAG
    without &quot;seeing the light&quot; ? When you &quot;see the light&quot; (get
    the L1 signal sent from the other side - no Ethernet over SomethingElse) a number
    of issues disappear.<br /><br />What am I missing here ?
