Useful if you want to grow expensive BW granularly<br />- LAG vs. ECMP: next to the obvious IGP scaling issue with // IP links,LAG supports fate-sharing between member-links using port-thresholds (LAG fails if min nr of member-links fail) - useful to avoid congestion. Not trivial with ECMP over IP links",

      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br /><br />- LAG has means to utilise BFD. draft-mmm-bfd-on-lags is one of them...<br />- LAG has some finer control over its members with things like setting a threshold of active members before failing the whole bundle (AKA minimum-links)<br />- LAG work across same-speed members (1g/10g/etc) whereas ECMP doesn&#39;t have this requirement<br />- in more general note. LAG w/ LACP is stateful (from the LAG POV, not the the member POV). ECMP is stateless in this sense. hence, adding/removing links from a LAG is communicated to the other end.<br /> ",
