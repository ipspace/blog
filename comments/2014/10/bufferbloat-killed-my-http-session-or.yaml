  html: 'Agree with that parenthetical (weird).  I wonder what would happen if the
    packet filter was sending TCP RST instead of ICMP unreach.  (-p TCP REJECT --reject-with
    tcp-reset).<br /><br />One point that does make sense is Linux (by default) ratelimits
    certain ICMP (including unreach) per target, to 1 per second.  Hence why the screenshot
    doesn&#39;t show more than one ICMP for all those incoming packets.   http://linux.die.net/man/7/icmp<br
    /><br />I didn&#39;t understand the red lines at the bottom either.  Doesn&#39;t
    the ICMP quote the TCP/IP headers, get passed to the transport layer, and terminate
    the connection immediately?  .  Hmm, it&#39;s claimed that at least Linux clients
    treat ICMPs for established TCP connections as soft errors (retransmit opportunities),
    to prevent DoS.  '

    html: I also thought that TCP segment reordering is a job of the Transport layer,
      which is a layer on the client and server, and what in the middle are not aware
      of.

    html: Different packets in the same session are not guaranteed to take the same
      path through the internet.<br /><br />Due to various path and link load-balancing
      methods, different packets can take a different path, and some might be queued
      differently along the path, or the path might have a different latency -- resulting
      in unpredictable ordering.<br /><br />It is still TCP&#39;s job to produce a
      reliable stream from this.<br /><br />And if Apache sent all the data, the client
      should get all the data, before they process the closing of the TCP stream....<br

    html: I have to recognize that 100Mbps is quite random. On a LAN/MAN (ms-level
      latency), that limit is definitely higher. It all depends on &quot;how badly
      out-of order&quot; they are.

    buffering the response on a slow connection it might have received close from

    keepalive-timeout is applied to identify idle connection and triggered after completing

  html: Lot of questions than answer<br /><br />we are talking about 2 issues here
    TCP connection close and TCP-re-order. Is there are relationship between them
    ?. As per one of the comments on TCP_Sequence_Number_Randomization_and_SACK, how
    does the end node behave when SACK is invalid ?<br /><br />focusing on connection
    down issue, do not understand few things<br /><br />1) If the problem is due to
    buffer bloat (atleast that is what it seem to indicate due to increase in http
    keepalive timer), the ICMP packet generated by IPtables seem to reach earlier
    than actual download packets. Does the ISP throttling based on amount of upload/download
    ?<br /><br />2) The post has packet captures at one end, is there a packet captures
    from other end ?
