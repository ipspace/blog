            <div class="comment-content">&quot;Netconf [on Cisco] is like CLI with wrappers&quot; - That was largely true on Cisco&#39;s initial Netconf implementations.  But I thought some of the newer OSes (IOS-XR?) had a less CLI-centric and more &quot;data-centric&quot;/hierarchical approach to configuration, and provided a nicer mapping between configuration and XML.  But maybe that&#39;s just wishful thinking, as I haven&#39;t played with those implementations myself.</div>
