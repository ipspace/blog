    html: The next time you find a working Carrier Ethernet solution between my web
      site and all its visitors let me know ;)<br /><br />On a more serious note,
      if you do packet marking on the edge of a Carrier Ethernet network (based on
      in-contract/out-of-contract decision) and combine that with any form of differentiated
      queuing within the network you might get the same results.

  html: If you used Carrier Ethernet instead of IP links you wouldn&#39;t be writing
    this!

  html: I&#39;ve run into some ISPs in APAC doing per-packet load-balancing on their
    outbound traffic.  After I explained to them the various reasons this is a Bad
    Idea, they switched over to saner traffic engineering methodologies.

  html: Some content providers have moved (some are moving) toward TCP anycast (just
    like CDNs), and as far as I can tell per packet loadbalancing as well as BGP multi-path
    AS-Path relax are the enemies of both TCP and chatty UDP anycast (AKA. DNSSEC)
    over internet. Please don&#39;t do that!

  html: 'Flowlets allows to change the switching path e.g. when we want to reduce
    load on one paths and move traffic to another one:<br />http://nms.lcs.mit.edu/~kandula/data/FLARE_HotNets04_web.ppt<br
    />It&#39;s an interesting idea: you can change path of the flow once the gap between
    bursts of the flow is longer than the trip time to the merging point (assume that
    we have splitting and mergin point of two splitted paths). This way we can avoid
    re-ordering as we make sure that merging point is reached by the previouse burst
    of the same flow.'

  html: 'Meh. Still sounded like bufferbloat to me. Using TCP trace on your RTTs on
    your capture and xplot.org is generally better than the wireshark equivalents.
    Try it. Post the plots.<br /><br />Classic tcptrace xplot.org plots here, and
    worth looking at in context with your problem. <br /><br />http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/06/whose-house-is-of-glasse-must-not-throw-stones-at-another/<br
    /><br />On your packet re-ordering idea, many wifi aps tend to reorder when doing
    retries - which is a GOOD thing - as it lowers latency on the AP. <br /><br />TCP
    stream reassembly is the job of the OS and linux and osx handle it well. Modern
    Linux&#39;s, especially. <br /><br />Windows - even modern versions of windows
    - does it really badly. Redmond is asleep at the switch. '

  html: And while I&#39;m at it, many people implementing &quot;SFQ&quot; DO permute
    the hash every 10 seconds, as that is what wondershaper did, and zillions of people
    just blindly copied that. It forces re-ordering every 10 seconds, which kept latency
    low, and acted as a poor mans AQM, in it&#39;s own weird way. <br /><br />It&#39;s
    easy to see a misconfigured SFQ doing that if you have captures. 10 second period
    for the scrambling, under load.<br /><br />This dumb behavior in Linux&#39;s SFQ
    implementation was fixed around version 3.6, I believe, so periodic permutation
    no longer does that harm (but no longer acts as a poor man&#39;s AQM), but it
    will take a decade for that to sort itself out in the field.<br /><br />http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/Wondershaper_Must_Die

  html: 'In the scenario where you use MPLS pseudo-wires without MPLS Control-Word
    set no the packets, you can very easily end up re-ordering packets towards MAC
