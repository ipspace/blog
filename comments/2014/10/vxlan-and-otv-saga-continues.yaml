    html: Neither will I ... or a few other people:<br /><br />http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/03/stretched-layer-2-subnets-server.html<br
      /><br />It is, however, more lucrative from vendors&#39; or system integrators&#39;
      perspective to sell more boxes (or more complex boxe) to the customer than telling
      them that they should fix their apps.

    html: While I agree that stretched layer 2 does not make sense from a networking
      perspective, your assertion that &quot;they should fix their apps&quot; lives
      in world of unicorns and fairies.  That will never happen.  There is not a chance
      that an Oracle ERP with 1000&#39;s of moving parts will ever work they way we
      wish it would (Ok maybe it is possible but how many millions would it take....).
      Just my prospective from higher ed.

    html: Yep, and mission-critical apps will never move from mainframes to minicomputers
      (let alone PCs). Been there, heard that.<br /><br />It will just take a while
      longer in some environments than others.

  html: What I will never understand is the insistence to do l2 dci to begin with.  No
    matter what the solution is it will always be kludgy as its outside of ethernet&#39;s
    design scope.  Problems need to be solved at the proper place and app redundancy
    is not a network one in my opinion.  Am I off base?

  html: Nice responses to readers questions.I agree with the responses and additionally
    , state synchronization between the FWs in the both data centers and state sync
    between other stateful devices could be necessary if the RTO requirement is 0
    or near 0 , in case one of the data center fail. <br /><br />But of course just
    you can do it does not mean you should do it. DCI link failures might cause more
    issue than what ot would solve.<br /><br />Also for the OTV edge devices ,what
    I would say to this commenter in addition to your excellent and meaningful response
    :) , although they are not single point of failure , they can not be used in load
    share scenario due to how it works to avoid forwarding loop. So the convergence
    time needs to be considered and maybe adjusted and also odd/even Vlan separation
    needs to be arranged carefully for multihoming ( Management complexity.! ).

    /><br />You are only protected whilst nothing has failed. It doesn&#39;t matter
    what protocol/technology/features you are using, or what protection mechanisms
    you have in place. A faulty supervisor module can quite easily identify your single
    failure domain, I speak from experience ;) '

    html: "/ <br />Let me split the answers in 3 different replies, otherwise it seems\
      \ that the whole response is too long<br />/<br />Thank you Ivan for the fast\
      \ reply. Let me give you here my thoughts. Please note that I\u2019m replying\
      \ to the comments made previously only, but several other requirements to build\
      \ a solid DCI are described in the post I mentioned above.<br />\_<br />Ivan&gt;&gt;\
      \ First a nit: most overlay virtual networking implementations no longer require\
      \ multicast, the only exception being vShield suite (which is a zombie anyway).<br\
      \ />\_<br />yves &gt;&gt; yes and no :) - But this point is crucial.<br />\_\
      <br />From a software-based VXLAN point of view, there are indeed several vendors\
      \ who already offer unicast-only mode.<br />From a ToR-based VXLAN point of\
      \ view, as far as I\u2019m aware, most of vendors are still enabling VXLAN in\
      \ Multicast mode (TBC).<br />We will certainly comeback in the near future to\
      \ this last statement, but as I said things are moving quickly however I\u2019\
      m talking about what is available today.<br />\_<br />Back to the software-based\
      \ VXLAN. Leaving aside discussions on scalability and performances, no one wants/can\
      \ deploy a fully virtual environment, it&#39;s always an hybrid network with\
      \ communication with traditional platforms, hence we need VTEP Gateway (L2)\
      \ for the VLAN ID &lt;=&gt; VNI mapping. Unfortunately, currently only one single\
      \ active L2 gateway per VXLAN domain is supported in software-based VTEP. Thus\
      \ the reason I left aside the software-based solution although it offers unicast-only\
      \ mode. If that assumption is correct, then the software-based VXLAN cannot\
      \ be a DCI solution as I explained in these posts below.<br />\_<br />In short,\
      \ if we want to extend a set of VLAN across 2 or more locations using VXLAN\
      \ as the DCI protocol transport with only one L2 gateway that exists for the\
      \ whole VXLAN domain, how a remote VLAN to be extended can hit the active L2\
      \ gateway. The ToR-based VXLAN can support today distributed active L2 gateways\
      \ but does not offer currently a CP for the distribution and learning process.<br\

      \ long-distance ASA cluster, do tell me what happens when the DCI link fails?<br\
      \ />\_<br />yves&gt;&gt; This is a fair comment. Actually there are two levels\
      \ of LAN extension when deploying Act/Act FW clustering stretched across multiple\
      \ locations, one level for the ASA clustering (extending the cluster control\
      \ link) and one level for the Apps and user data (traditional DCI), obviously\
      \ all redundant network connections for a resilient solution must exist, but\
      \ let\u2019s assume the DCI dies.<br />\_<br />The key components are that 1st\
      \ of all, all FW appliances are active and secondly there is a way to control\
      \ dynamically the direction In &amp; Out to the right DC supporting the Apps\
      \ of interest.<br />\_<br />Hence the best is a combination of ASA clustering\
      \ stretched across two sites (using a single cluster control plane) with the\
      \ LAN extension (such OTV offering stateful \u201Chot\u201D live migration),\
      \ in conjunction with LISP IP mobility (ingress redirection) and FHRP localization\
      \ (egress redirection).<br />\_<br />If the DCI breaks, we will get a split\
      \ brain like for any other clusters. But the main difference is that with the\
      \ ASA clustering, all FW appliances (phy or virtual) are active, and thanks\
      \ to LISP IP mobility and FHRP isolation, the traffic will follow the location\
      \ of the apps per site and will stay stuck to the site where the apps resides\
      \ as it will not be possible to address hot live migration anymore. However\
      \ Disaster Recovery with cold migration should be supported. Both DC becomes\

  html: "VXLAN is an overlay network that aims to extend Layer 2 over an IP network;\
    \ that doesn&#39;t mean that this is a DCI solution. Same statement could be made\
    \ with L2TPv3 or EoMPLS, just to list few, they aim to extend L2 segments, but\
    \ are not natively DCI solution per se. And that&#39;s the reason why OTV or EVPN\
    \ exists to offer natively a solid DCI solution.\_It\u2019s not just a feature-to-feature\
    \ comparison. That requires above all an architectural comparison; As described\
    \ in your drawing, VXLAN is an end-to-end encapsulation meaning that from a transport\
    \ point of view, it is a flat architecture. OTV is a DC WAN edge encapsulation,\
    \ this means that it is an hierarchical architecture, and according to this principal,\
    \ it better isolates the failure domain inside the DC and it offers better scalability\
    \ and convergences. <br /><br />With OTV and FHRP localization, you can definitively\
    \ reduce the tromboning effect for E-W traffic (inter-tier Apps workflows) without\
    \ the need to deploy LISP IP mobility or other southbound optimization services.\
    \ The Layer 3 gateway of interest is active on each site thus the traffic between\
    \ application tiers is contained inside each DC without hair-pining workflows\
    \ across sites. This is currently challenging with VXLAN alone.<br /><br />With\
    \ OTV, the UU are not flooded. And storm-control configuration is simplified,\
    \ because of failure isolation functionality natively available with OTV (for\
    \ broadcast and unknown unicast). Thus a VM with a 10GE throughput that becomes\
    \ &quot;broadcast-crazy&quot; should not impact the secondary site if the right\
    \ tools are implemented accordingly. This is not completely true with VXLAN unfortunately,\
    \ and it might be very challenging to rate limit an IP Multicast group. As the\
    \ result with the current implementation of VXLAN with no control plane, the failure\
    \ domain is extended throughout the whole VXLAN domain with a huge risk to saturate\
    \ the DCI links and impacting the remote sites.<br />Note that if VXLAN requires\
    \ an IP multicast network intra-DC which may be accepted by the enterprise, it\
    \ would also impose IP multicast enabled for inter-DC network, which might be\
    \ more challenging for the enterprise and/or the SP managing the inter-site IP\
    \ network.<br /><br />OTV in conjunction with LISP IP mobility and FHRP localization\
    \ offers a real optimization for long distances between DC\u2019s. When LISP IP\
    \ mobility is deployed with extended subnets, it is complementary to OTV but is\
    \ not mandatory. It is a smart choice that the network mgr will take based on\
    \ how the high latency induced by the long distances may impact the enterprise\
    \ business. Anyhow, for most of enterprises deploying DCI, the WAN access network\
    \ is an Intranet network where LISP is easy to deploy and rarely a global Internet\
    \ core per se. <br /><br />What is said today may be a bit different in the future.\
    \ Solutions for distributed virtual DC are evolving in order to improve sturdiness,\
    \ efficiency and optimization, including FW clustering stretched across multiple\
    \ locations. It is important for enterprises to pay attention to this fast evolution.<br\
    \ /><br />Finally long story short, it is certainly worth reading the detailed\
    \ posts I made that discuss about the current VXLAN release and DCI, including\
    \ LISP mobility and other FW clustering articles.<br /><br />26 \u2013 Is VxLAN\
