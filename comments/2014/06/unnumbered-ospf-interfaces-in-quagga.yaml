    html: /31 doesn&#39;t give you anything (apart from reduction in wasted addresses).
      Can you plug a L3-only link (routed interface) into another port and expect
      it to work?

  html: But, doesn&#39;t this save one Type-2 Network LSA per point-to-point link
    in the OSPF database? It&#39;s a sincere question, I would say that the connectivity
    between both routers is included in their respective Type-1 LSAs and the Type-2
    pseudonode is not required, saving <i>some</i> memory and processing.

    html: 'Monitoring? Depends on the tool you use and what it uses as unique interface
      ID.<br /><br />Debugging? Of course there will be drawbacks (as always with
      the unnumbered interfaces). Example: traceroute will not identify individual

    protocol is decoupled from the IP?  Do unnumbered interfaces do additional things
    to do with ARP?

  html: You write &#39;I love the way Quagga handles point-to-point Ethernet links&#39;.
    But I was not able to use unnumbered interfaces with stock Quagga in described
    way; two reasons for that:<br /><br />- an interface with netmask /32 address
    is not recognized as OSPF interface, even being point-to-point.<br /><br />- OSPF
    is choking on a host with several identical IP addresses (as you say here http://blog.ipspace.net/2008/10/ospf-breaks-when-faced-with-overlapping.html
    that &quot;OSPF gets totally confused when two interfaces have the same IP address.&quot;)<br
    /><br />How come? Does Cumulus ship their own Quagga version to handle these two
    issues?

    html: OSPF virtual link is not an interface, but a construct in the OSPF topology
      database.<br /><br />VPN link is (usually) an interface, and standard interface
      numbering rules apply.

  html: '<i> &gt; IPv6 has unnumbered interfaces built in (they are called Link Local
    Addresses), and intra-AS routing protocols like OSPF have to use them</i><br />Yes,
    except for &#39;virtual interfaces&#39;, called so in RFC5340: &quot;The IPv6
    interface address of a <b>virtual link</b> MUST be an IPv6 address having global
    scope, instead of the link-local addresses used by other interface types.&quot;<br
    /><br />What can be the reason for this exception? And does it mean that if I
    have OSPFv3 running over a point-to-point IPv6 VPN link, then I must configure
    and &quot;waste&quot; a two-host IPv6 network?'
