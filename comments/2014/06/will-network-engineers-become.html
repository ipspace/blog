            <div class="comment-content">Though network engineers need not learn to program in the language of<br />the machine (c, c++), I guess it will be useful to program in the language of the<br />domain that provides high-level objects and APIs specific to the domain (python as of<br />today).<br /><br />Another interesting recent trend seen especially in the datacenter world is where network engineers are themselves adding features onto network boxes that allow them to do so, using very minimal programming effort.<br />https://www.nanog.org/sites/default/files/wednesday_general_field_openrouter_39.pdf<br /><br />-- <br />-Thejas</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Ivan,  thanks for the mention. You bring up good points on being a generalist at a small shop or embedding experts at the larger shops, etc.  On a related note, Najam Ahmad (Facebook) recently talked about what they are doing these days and mentioned they are doing internal pairing between teams, essentially pairing up a network engineer with a software developer to better understand what each does and to ensure there is some level of cross-training going on.  And of course, it helps the network engineer articulate requirements better too.  It&#39;s also worth noting they have a dedicated software team for networking! Different size, diff requirements, and you paint a good picture for the Enterprise to Commercial segments.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Petr: For hiring, we look for good programmers first, that have at least minimum understanding of networking. We think, that should be ok, as their mindset allows them to learn network engineering topics fast. <br />Just think of the abstractions of OpenFlow, or the OpenDaylight northbound API. They do that for breakfast...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">We already are programmers and have always been.  The languages we speak are IPv4, IPv6, OSPF, IS-IS, MP-BGP, MPLS, Cisco IOS variants, Junos, the list goes on; basically all the cool stuff that actually moves data from box to box around the web.  Networks have always been &quot;software defined.&quot;  Will some abstraction layer swallow us all up?  Perhaps someday, but Openflow and ACI/OnePK/whateverCiscoiscallingit have yet to show me anything that makes me fear becoming obsolete.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The only language you&#39;ve highlighted is Cisco&#39;s proprietary IOS, hence not much use to you outside of an all Cisco environment, everything else you mention appears to be a &#39;protocol&#39; many of which are dynamic in nature. So while you are right that networks have always been defined by software, you&#39;ve missed the point behind Open Networks.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I agree with Jeff, in one manner the IOS or various network OS&#39;s of our platforms are the scripting languages. I used to do some ASAM or C level libnet network related programming but for special cases. I agree that mastering a scripting language does help as I am working on python myself. We also do work with automation tools in some ways, the Cisco works, prime, or IPAM systems etc. We have to know protocols cold, the specs and standards which when teamed with a solid coder provides great value. I remember when the snmp revolution was suppose to automate and control everything but you can do so much  with ASN. And I second Jeff&#39;s last sentence for us experienced veterans we learned one major important, evaluate, wait and select what NOT to learn. <br /><br />Example, I didn&#39;t bother with ATM outside of certification knowledge or one or 2 installs but that was it. remember when ATM was going to take over the world...<br /><br />So I will read up on it, maybe play a bit with OF but not dive into it until things settle down, mature a bit.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I come from the other side. I&#39;m a programmer who works on network related software. Agree we need to also learn networking. Your comment &quot;at least to a CCNA-like level (without the router configs and other garbage, of course)&quot; seems like a good balance. Also info sources like your blog are a big help.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Remember that SDN is just another marketing hype so that Cisco and other vendors can sell products and meet quarterly earnings for their stock. Realistically since this is the new buzz word, everyone is going to push in that direction. Ultimately a lot of network engineers like myself who have no interest whatsoever in being a  programmer will have to change careers and go in real estate or whatever makes real money since most of these jobs will be outsourced to India for $2.50/hr since they can do both bad networking and bad programming at the same time.</div>
