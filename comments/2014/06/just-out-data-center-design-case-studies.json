      "html": "This type of book is - from my point of view - exactly what&#39;s missing in the networking publishing world: real case studies, real issues, well argued and documented solutions presented in a friendly and clean format. Ivan&#39;t style makes it easy to read and valuable nuggets from his wealth of experience and knowledge are elegantly and efficiently passed on. I&#39;ve read this in one breath as a novel - not really the way it should be done but I was really curious to see all that I&#39;ll be able to dig in deeper afterwards. The DMVPN case study gave me a few extra points to consider for a current project. Looking forward to the next chapters! Thank you, Ivan!",
