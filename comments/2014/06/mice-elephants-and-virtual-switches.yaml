  html: UCIF has been trying to address this issue by letting Unified Communications
    applications request QoS treatment through a well-defined API (http://www.ucif.org/Technology/UCSoftwareDefinedNetworkingUCSDN.aspx).
    This eliminates the need for the network to apply QoS markings solely based on
    network-level guesses about application-level information.

  html: Ivan, I agree with your concerns about the scaleability of tracking each flow.
    An alternative method of detecting and marking large flows is to use packet sampling
    (sFlow) in Open vSwitch, or in the physical top of rack switches to detect the
    large flows and OpenFlow to insert marking rules. The following article describes
    the SDN controller:<br /><br /><a href="http://blog.sflow.com/2014/03/performance-optimizing-hybrid-openflow.html"

  html: I wrote in my only SDN focussed blog post to date that the marketing people
    are muddying the waters in this area. I&#39;d go so far as to say that they are
    hindering adoption with their FUD.<br /><br />Nice write up Ivan.
