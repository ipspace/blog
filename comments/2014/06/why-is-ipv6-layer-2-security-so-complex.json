      "html": "Hi Ivan,<br />thanks for the, as always, enlightening post &amp; creative ideas ;-)<br />Not sure though how the approach you laid out would solve any of the security problems First-Hop Sec (FHS) is supposed to solve. Advertising a prefix with the on-link flag cleared will indeed (initially, until receiving an ICMP redirect) force a host to communicate through its L3 gateway and hence create a &quot;PVLAN illusion&quot; from the host&#39;s perspective, as you rightfully described here http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/11/ipv6-on-link-determination-what-is-it.html. <br />Still, that host will happily process all rogue RA, ND, DHCPv6 messages received from other (potentially malicious) hosts on the same link. Preventing that is the main purpose of FHS, isn&#39;t it?<br />Or did I miss something in your above approach?<br /><br />That said, may I further add that any mention of the terms &quot;host routes&quot; and &quot;redistribution&quot; in one sentence makes me shudder instantaneously?<br /><br />have a great day,<br /><br />Enno",

We have looked at &quot;most&quot; larger organizations using a /48 for infrastructure and indeed assigning a /64 &quot;per port, host, etc.) looking at summarizing an access switch with a /56 (256 /64&#39;s, ports, hosts, etc.). The thought being that these larger entities will get a /44 or /40. Wether the subnet has 2, 20, 200 or 2,000 nodes they are all in the same drop of water hitting the pool of 18.5 Quintillion. Some challenges that I have encountered with &quot;proposing&quot; this solution are: 1, Dual stack and how to handle the &quot;legacy&quot; protocol. 2, This is wired only (WiFi would take some considerable thought). 3, IP telephony devices.",
