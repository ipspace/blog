      "html": "Welcome to VM admin land. We have been crying for this for years. The last hold outs - networking. We have had the ability for about 3 years, but were forbidden to implement. <br /><br />Once a routable network exists, network overlays can segment, inspect, route, firewall, and audit with the touch of a button. Why would you want to continue to manage hardware? Ahhh, riiiiight, &quot;my turf&quot;. VM admins gave up servers and storage administration as a primary duty long ago. &quot;Bring us your resources, we will make the do work&quot; has been the motto for some time. <br /><br />How does a VM/cloud admin create a new segment of the network? They launch a UI (or API); define common name, subnet, segmentation, and relationship; submit; validate; and release to production. The orchestration engine reaches out to each virtual network device, modifies the configuration, verifies the change, and reports status. <br /><br />I guess the alternative is to have the network team register their equipment within something like VMware Orchestrator so that we can programmatically control the hardware instead. That should fly, right, hello, anyone here...<br /><br />The next generation networks are truly flat, any-to-any fabrics with software services riding on top. &quot;What about physical systems?&quot; They receive their own routed network which the rest of the datacenter can reach.

      "html": "Infrastructure as code can be implemented in a variety of ways - AWS has it with Cloud Formations, PaaSs have it with containers and other deployment tools and Ravello Systems has implemented the &quot;infrastructure as code&quot; concept with high performance nested virtualization. VMware represented a physical server as a VM (essentially a file). Ravello extends that concept to the whole environment - VMs, networking and storage. Essentially your entire application environment is a file. The Ravello hypervisor also allows you to run existing VMware workloads (including networking) in AWS completely unmodified. It also allows you to snapshot the whole thing, version control your infrastructure, re-create bugs etc. ",

      "html": "Good approach I would say, as it sounds consistent and may meet programming best practices.<br />But do you really expect that VMs may replace network hardware where we have a lot of hardware-enabled features, like hardware optimized switching.<br /><br />Virtualization brings additional (penalties) latency and jitter into your network. Do you think we are ready to replace fast low-latency hardware with software blown VMs; do you think VM solutions are mature for complete network infrastructure virtualization?",
