  html: I don&#39;t think that Distributed Virtual Routers made it into the Icehouse
    release.  You still need a dedicated network node.<br /><br />Nothing mentioned
    in the release notes<br />https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/ReleaseNotes/Icehouse#OpenStack_Network_Service_.28Neutron.29<br
    /><br />It&#39;s something that is really needed to provide some performance parity
    with NSX for VMWare and Hyper-V networking.<br />

  html: 'Distributed routing is there in Apache CloudStack 4.4 (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/4Y5cAg).
    ARP packets are flooded into the mesh in a loop-free manner. The solution can
    be further optimized by implementing a local ARP proxy on each hypervisor node. '

  html: '- layer-2 gateway glitches exist for all virtualization solution that do
    not use Openflow. It is more of architecture issue than do with Openflow. Why
    blame OF ?<br />- Proxy-ARP is more to do with vSwitch, why blame Openflow again
    ?<br /><br />Agree, OF is re-inventing the forwarding plane wheel but it provides
    great features like table typing etc. Traditional forwarding plane has pretty
    fixed forwarding plane.'
