You bring up good points on being a generalist at a small shop or embedding experts at the larger shops, etc.  On a related note, Najam Ahmad (Facebook) recently talked about what they are doing these days and mentioned they are doing internal pairing between teams, essentially pairing up a network engineer with a software developer to better understand what each does and to ensure there is some level of cross-training going on.  And of course, it helps the network engineer articulate requirements better too.  It&#39;s also worth noting they have a dedicated software team for networking! Different size, diff requirements, and you paint a good picture for the Enterprise to Commercial segments.",

I used to do some ASAM or C level libnet network related programming but for special cases. I agree that mastering a scripting language does help as I am working on python myself. We also do work with automation tools in some ways, the Cisco works, prime, or IPAM systems etc. We have to know protocols cold, the specs and standards which when teamed with a solid coder provides great value. I remember when the snmp revolution was suppose to automate and control everything but you can do so much  with ASN. And I second Jeff&#39;s last sentence for us experienced veterans we learned one major important, evaluate, wait and select what NOT to learn. <br /><br />Example, I didn&#39;t bother with ATM outside of certification knowledge or one or 2 installs but that was it. remember when ATM was going to take over the world...<br /><br />So I will read up on it, maybe play a bit with OF but not dive into it until things settle down, mature a bit.",
