      "html": "Great article Ivan - a lot of people lack a higher level perspective and appreciation for the complexity of what other people in other departments do.  It&#39;s tough for some people to get over that self-important, &quot;I&#39;m irreplaceable&quot;, &quot;Nobody can do my job because only I understand all of this&quot; mentality.  Sometimes all it takes is sitting down with some of those people whose jobs appear &quot;simple&quot; to you to see that there is a complexity and attention to detail in every job function - and learning these intricacies can be greatly beneficial to inter and intra-team interaction, communication, and ultimately, output.",

      "html": "Excellent article Ivan. I always learn something new by reading your articles, this one makes no exception. Now, I have a name for this &#39;syndrome&#39; which many IT people are affected.<br /><br />In a constantly changing domain/area such as IT, training is very crucial. Unfortunately, more and more professionals tends to ignore this fact. Personally, the more I learn through books, courses, and webinars (thanks to the high-quality content you offer), the more I discover I have no clue about my work and I have to learn.<br /><br />The exact opposite seems to happen with over-confident people. They are absolutely certain they can easily and rapidly tackle problems (some of them very complex) and without any previous technical background or practical experience. It&#39;s even more unfortunate that some of them have power, and can affect hiring and/or the outcome of very important projects.<br /><br />I sincerely do hope this will change over time, especially if passionate and skilled professionals want to keep their foots in IT.",

Now.... clearly competence is domain specific.<br /><br />Most doctors might not be cut out to personally manage their own investments,  but there are some who have some business and accounting savvy and are passionate about it, and may spend an enormous amount of time conducting research in the area  and do excellent due dilligence,   so they could be better than any advisor they could find.     Everyone has finite time and cannot be competent in all possible areas.<br /><br />About giving kids the keys to the car....   The developers would probably feel the same way about the network  guys   trying to script up  configuration automation  and automated configuration management for the servers.<br />",
