You still need a dedicated network node.<br /><br />Nothing mentioned in the release notes<br />https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/ReleaseNotes/Icehouse#OpenStack_Network_Service_.28Neutron.29<br /><br />It&#39;s something that is really needed to provide some performance parity with NSX for VMWare and Hyper-V networking.<br />",

      "html": "- layer-2 gateway glitches exist for all virtualization solution that do not use Openflow. It is more of architecture issue than do with Openflow. Why blame OF ?<br />- Proxy-ARP is more to do with vSwitch, why blame Openflow again ?<br /><br />Agree, OF is re-inventing the forwarding plane wheel but it provides great features like table typing etc. Traditional forwarding plane has pretty fixed forwarding plane.",
