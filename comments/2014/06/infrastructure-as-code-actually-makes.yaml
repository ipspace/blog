  html: 'Welcome to VM admin land. We have been crying for this for years. The last
    hold outs - networking. We have had the ability for about 3 years, but were forbidden
    to implement. <br /><br />Once a routable network exists, network overlays can
    segment, inspect, route, firewall, and audit with the touch of a button. Why would
    you want to continue to manage hardware? Ahhh, riiiiight, &quot;my turf&quot;.
    VM admins gave up servers and storage administration as a primary duty long ago.
    &quot;Bring us your resources, we will make the do work&quot; has been the motto
    for some time. <br /><br />How does a VM/cloud admin create a new segment of the
    network? They launch a UI (or API); define common name, subnet, segmentation,
    and relationship; submit; validate; and release to production. The orchestration
    engine reaches out to each virtual network device, modifies the configuration,
    verifies the change, and reports status. <br /><br />I guess the alternative is
    to have the network team register their equipment within something like VMware
    Orchestrator so that we can programmatically control the hardware instead. That
    should fly, right, hello, anyone here...<br /><br />The next generation networks
    are truly flat, any-to-any fabrics with software services riding on top. &quot;What
    about physical systems?&quot; They receive their own routed network which the
    rest of the datacenter can reach. '

  html: 'Infrastructure as code can be implemented in a variety of ways - AWS has
    it with Cloud Formations, PaaSs have it with containers and other deployment tools
    and Ravello Systems has implemented the &quot;infrastructure as code&quot; concept
    with high performance nested virtualization. VMware represented a physical server
    as a VM (essentially a file). Ravello extends that concept to the whole environment
    - VMs, networking and storage. Essentially your entire application environment
    is a file. The Ravello hypervisor also allows you to run existing VMware workloads
    (including networking) in AWS completely unmodified. It also allows you to snapshot
    the whole thing, version control your infrastructure, re-create bugs etc. '

  html: Good approach I would say, as it sounds consistent and may meet programming
    best practices.<br />But do you really expect that VMs may replace network hardware
    where we have a lot of hardware-enabled features, like hardware optimized switching.<br
    /><br />Virtualization brings additional (penalties) latency and jitter into your
    network. Do you think we are ready to replace fast low-latency hardware with software
    blown VMs; do you think VM solutions are mature for complete network infrastructure
    virtualization?
