            <div class="comment-content">Yes, I wanted to know about this one. Do Azure or Amazon Clouds have Network Engineers to maintain the &#39;Network&#39; part in case of connectivity issues within the cloud? Do they employ phy switches? If yes are they Cisco ones (if anyone is aware)....?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">They have more than 100.000 servers in a single data center? How do you think those servers are connected? Of course they&#39;re using physical switches, see also<br /><br />http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/02/going-all-virtual-with-virtual-wan-edge.html<br /><br />With 50 server-facing ports on a switch, a typical large cloud data center would have thousands of ToR switches and &quot;a few&quot; core switches. Don&#39;t you think you need a dedicated team to take care of them? Does it matter what job titles that team has?</div>

            <div class="comment-content">&quot;Then what we were doing all these years for?&quot;  Getting in the way?<br /><br />I design and build these solutions for a living. The network architects I have worked with are outstanding. However once the design is complete, the physical remains fairly static (except for expansion). Its primary job is to provide an IP bus for the virtualized solutions above.<br /><br />I see a future wherein all of the supporting functions are subsumed by the virtual console. Network, compute storage, and security will be registered to the &#39;brain&#39; and all configuration and operations orchestrated from the top down.<br /><br /> Compute and storage have already been solved. Today, I can click a link and spin up a physical server, deploy the platform, and finish configuration. Same for storage, but to a limited degree. <br /><br />Some large automated networks have cracked the code as well. Their switches PXE boot, register to the controller, and are programmed accordingly. This could come to the consumer market within a few years.<br /><br />The tide is shifting from those who can administer to those who can orchestrate.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Umm, no. Virtualized environments have pushed out server admins, and is working on storage. The next will be networking (within the datacenter). <br /><br />I can do it today with VMware/OpenStack/CloudStack. Once the plumbing is up, I can create, router, firewall, etc. multiple networks with no interaction from the network team. <br /><br />ACI will fail as it is going the wrong direction. Applications are the focus. The app/dev personnel will be able to deploy an application, attach compute and storage, then deploy networking. When they click go, all of the resources will be configured to support the Application. <br /><br />The network engineer will have to adapt as have the compute and storage admins. The Borg is the VM side of the house. All else will be assimilated. Even then, the app/dev will drive the VM side of the house.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Thats what I am also implying the same..that we will....we will not stop only at SDN/NSX...we network engineers will ALSO ENTER VM and STORAGE....get it once for all.....we will be the be all and end all....no need for VM/Storage engg like you...<br /><br />Also what about network outside of the DC? Do you think Enterprises will let a seprate team handle the physical netywork and VM team handle the virtualised network? Hell no... Virtualised network will also be handled by Seasoned Network engineers......and then once we get our hands on the VMware tools...we will slowly moved forwards understanding everything....<br /><br />For ACI, app are the main focus...looks like you have no clue on ACI.<br />Also when we get our access to NSX..we may as well steer it towards ACI..who knows?? And we wont stop at that..we will go after Storage and VM and what you guys have learnt in 8 yrs, we will get there under 1 yr flat..in short we will ensure we will not go the admin way....you will be out this time...we will setup networks, firewalls, VM, storage in one click...and when VM experts leave....we will intake only people with network background and train them on VM.Storage.<br /><br />First you handle a produciton NSX network and let me know....when there is connectivity blackout and the top mgmt is blowing down your neck...you will understand...<br /></div>

            <div class="comment-content">Sorry to have hit a personal nerve. Was attempting to discuss the technology and culture shifts coming. I have designed, built, certified, and operated enterprise datacenters (including the network) so I have no sacred cows.<br /><br />I would ask, if network personnel are going to take over the everything, then why are they the last to the virtualization and next generation table? <br /><br />Thank you for a spirited conversation.

            <div class="comment-content">Hey Ivan,<br /><br />I am a L3/L4 Network engineer working purely on Cisco Products and Network technologies as of now with 10 years of experience. Am CCNP Certified.<br /><br />I have worked on almost all the LAN/WAN/Nexus technologies.<br /><br />How long will it take for a typical person like me to get a foothold into VM/SAN?<br />VM/SAN work purely on L1/Physical....there is no routing/switching logic like in traditional networks. So I reckon we just need to know the facts. Build factual working knowledge of VM/SAN.<br /><br />I just attended an NSX walkthrough of building a simple network via NSX. Well there is nothing in it to build expertise on.<br /><br />Currently am involved with Network Automations but that&#39;s just a starting point.<br /><br />I just need a ball park figure. I know there is no definite answer.<br /></div>
