    html: The fix proposed is to only have one host per link, and have the hardware
      currently called the &quot;switch&quot; become an IPv6 router.

    html: 'Hi Ivan,<br /><br />so this would be the (as we called it at the time)
      &quot;micro-segmentation&quot; approach the two of us discussed somewhere back
      in 2013 (see also slide #11 of https://www.troopers.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/TROOPERS13-Design+Configuration_of_IPv6_Segments_with_High_Security_Requirements-Enno_Rey.pdf).<br
      />Don&#39;t mean to be pedantic here, but: in that case you don&#39;t even need
      clearing the on-link flag, given there&#39;s no neighbors anyway ;-)<br />Furthermore
      the above parts then seem a bit misleading to me, given you talk about &quot;hosts&quot;
      [plural] in a subnet/on the link.<br />Best<br /><br />Enno'

    html: No. The &quot;link&quot; is between the host and the adjacent router which
      terminates all RA|ND|DHCPv6 messages.

  html: Hi Ivan,<br />thanks for the, as always, enlightening post &amp; creative
    ideas ;-)<br />Not sure though how the approach you laid out would solve any of
    the security problems First-Hop Sec (FHS) is supposed to solve. Advertising a
    prefix with the on-link flag cleared will indeed (initially, until receiving an
    ICMP redirect) force a host to communicate through its L3 gateway and hence create
    a &quot;PVLAN illusion&quot; from the host&#39;s perspective, as you rightfully
    described here http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/11/ipv6-on-link-determination-what-is-it.html.
    <br />Still, that host will happily process all rogue RA, ND, DHCPv6 messages
    received from other (potentially malicious) hosts on the same link. Preventing
    that is the main purpose of FHS, isn&#39;t it?<br />Or did I miss something in
    your above approach?<br /><br />That said, may I further add that any mention
    of the terms &quot;host routes&quot; and &quot;redistribution&quot; in one sentence
    makes me shudder instantaneously?<br /><br />have a great day,<br /><br />Enno

  html: There will still be the need for a transport network for IPv6. Normally this
    would be the data link layer a.k.a. L2. The value of L2 is to provide the link
    connectivity. Getting rid of L2 means getting rid of connectivity.

    html: Not true. Every IPv6-capable switch can route packets to /128s - they use
      that functionality to implement ND cache, as I explained in the blog post and
      in more details in the linked document.

    html: OK, true for /128s, but there are still troubles with prefixes /65-/127.
      And we need at least /127 for a link. Then there are also hosts with multiple
      IPs.

  html: Very good idea, but there are some problems. There is a lot of network equipment,
    unable to route packets in hardware using routes with prefix longer than /64.
    And in general this is possible only in IPv6-only networks, since those with enough
    IPv4 addresses to spare at least /30 for every physical link are extremely scarce.

  html: 'Ivan,<br />Great blog and love the &quot;outside the box thinking&quot;.
    A few others (Ed, Andrew, Eric, Steve) and I have been kicking this around for
    a while now. We have looked at &quot;most&quot; larger organizations using a /48
    for infrastructure and indeed assigning a /64 &quot;per port, host, etc.) looking
    at summarizing an access switch with a /56 (256 /64&#39;s, ports, hosts, etc.).
    The thought being that these larger entities will get a /44 or /40. Wether the
    subnet has 2, 20, 200 or 2,000 nodes they are all in the same drop of water hitting
    the pool of 18.5 Quintillion. Some challenges that I have encountered with &quot;proposing&quot;
    this solution are: 1, Dual stack and how to handle the &quot;legacy&quot; protocol.
    2, This is wired only (WiFi would take some considerable thought). 3, IP telephony
    devices.'

  html: 'I love the out-of-the-box approach, and I see a lot of benefits. In the extreme
    HPC world, they do this with IPv4 already. coupled with TCP/IP stack offload/acceleration,
    it&#39;s extremely fast.<br /><br />In a campus environment, it would take some
    initial configs to get every port set up as an L3-link rather than a vlan-access
    port, but it&#39;s doable as long as the guys setting up the switches are the
    guys setting up the PCs.<br /><br />With wireless, this will be difficult without
    a massive amount of vendor support.<br /><br />In server environments, specifically
    for standalones/rackmounts, this is similar to the campus challenge: the server
    and switch ports will need to be a coordinated effort.<br /><br />In virtualized
    environments, this could all be API-driven, but I don&#39;t think there is any
    automated software at the moment capable of checking to see what /127s have been
    deployed (or what the next available is).<br /><br />Thoughts? The automation
    and self-provisioning is critical... the effort and related costs to doing this
    manually are not appealing. But if someone has a way to automate it, I&#39;d love
    to see this as the standard. <br /><br />CWB'
