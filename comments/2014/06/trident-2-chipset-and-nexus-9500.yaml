  html: Wonder if it can do encap / decap at line rate so that if a VM is on an SR-IOV
    the nic can simply tag with a VLAN and the trident can map the VLAN tag to a GRE
    tunnel or VxLAN VNI

    html: LPM matching doesn&#39;t need full TCAM functionality. You might find more
      information in Intel&#39;s FM6000 documentation.

  html: '&quot;The Nexus 9500 non-hierarchical forwarding mode (BRKARC-2222 slide
    49) moves the IP LPM table into linecard UFT&quot;...But how then they manage
    to place  LPM entries which require TCAM by their nature into UFT (which is probably
    a CAM table)?'

      to these questions ;)

  html: '&quot;Trident 2 chipset has 16K TCAM table and large Unified Forwarding Table
    (UFT)&quot;<br /><br />Any idea about the impact of using the UFT? What happens
    when you start using more then the 16k TCAM? Is the lookup as fast or will the
    latency start to increase? Any other side effects?'

  html: I know this post is old but for someone landing on this - Trident2 Broadcom
    chipset also supports a feature called ALPM (Algorithmic Longest Prefix Match).
    This is enabled on QFX5100 which allows you to store upto 384K IPv4 entries and
    upto 128K IPv6 entries by using larger SRAM along with TCAM. I am not certain
    if ALPM allows both IPv4 and IPv6 entries to go to their maximums.
