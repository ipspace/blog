      "html": "Speaking of throwing bandwidth at a problem, I&#39;ve just found out (although this is old news) that Cisco&#39;s Nexus FEX can locally only do CoS based QoS, so servers that are connected to a access port (ie no 802.1p/q) on a FEX cannot have their packets classified and queued appropriately queued (default best effort) on the FEX uplink to the parent Nexus.  <br /><br />To which Cisco&#39;s TAC recommendation was basically &quot;make sure you throw in enough uplinks to avoid congestion&quot;...<br /><br />What&#39;s your take on that? Is that a reasonable case of throw in bandwidth at the problem or is this just one more hidden crippling caveat for FEXs?<br /><br />",

IMHO We may need QoS even though operational cost of it ,configuration complexity and increased MTTR as negative factor , still if you want to manage microbursts, you may need to implement QoS at some level. Long topic actually but if you have a load which can create microburst so design might need to be re thought.",
