            <div class="comment-content">Back in university we programmed logic chips in MIPS2000 and then wired them into a PDP-7 board.  We were given a wiring diagram which listed all of the required logic gates for the alu and registers and told to get it working.  Wiring, mind you, not soldering as the boards were meant to be used for future classes.<br /><br />Afterwards we encoded and ran a few simple programs using on/off switches.  Oh yeah, this was in 2006.<br /><br />One of the most frustrating and useful classes I&#39;ve ever taken.</div>
