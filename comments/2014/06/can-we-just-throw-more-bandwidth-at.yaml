    html: I don&#39;t know why anyone would want a FEX when they can get a full-fledged
      layer 3 switch at a similar price point.<br />Considering the TCO of a FEX versus
      a real switch, it should be even more of a no-brainer.

  html: Speaking of throwing bandwidth at a problem, I&#39;ve just found out (although
    this is old news) that Cisco&#39;s Nexus FEX can locally only do CoS based QoS,
    so servers that are connected to a access port (ie no 802.1p/q) on a FEX cannot
    have their packets classified and queued appropriately queued (default best effort)
    on the FEX uplink to the parent Nexus.  <br /><br />To which Cisco&#39;s TAC recommendation
    was basically &quot;make sure you throw in enough uplinks to avoid congestion&quot;...<br
    /><br />What&#39;s your take on that? Is that a reasonable case of throw in bandwidth
    at the problem or is this just one more hidden crippling caveat for FEXs?<br /><br

  html: CoS-based QoS on a primarily layer 2 switch is perfectly fine, and putting
    enough uplinks to handle congestion is just common sense.

  html: For the high speed link environment such as LAN or Data Center , this question
    I also receive frequently. IMHO We may need QoS even though operational cost of
    it ,configuration complexity and increased MTTR as negative factor , still if
    you want to manage microbursts, you may need to implement QoS at some level. Long
    topic actually but if you have a load which can create microburst so design might
    need to be re thought.

    your silent killer... <br />

  html: Having enough uplinks is a key for DCs leafs, but ECN can make miracles with
    a fine tuned TCP stack.

  html: If there would be something in the world like _ask_ , _involve_ , _discuss_
    things before you start putting effort into application development just to find
    out that the &quot;lab testing&quot; does not perform the same over distributed
    location connected with 100Mbps and 200msec RTT :)<br /><br />Another problem
    I see here is the initial requirement. How many times you hear, I want some app
    just to do this simple stuff and then the client take that &quot;simple app&quot;
    and want to scale it to perform worldwide.
