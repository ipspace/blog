  html: Not to mention you can&#39;t bind tracking to IPv6 RA. WIth HSRP you can do
    a failover while tracking another interface, or route, or IP SLA. So I consider
    it a poor man&#39;s HA.

  html: Would/could IPv6 solve some of the HA scenarios by providing two different
    IPs, in different A/B nets? Hosts IP stacks are used to have multiple IPs in v6
    world anyway?<br />This should only be needed in case of a requirement for two
    physical uplinks (A/B-net) to the endhost. Single linked clients should have their
    L3 first-hop on their physical first-hop anyway :-)

    html: Yeah, that happens when you start answering questions before doing some
      background check first ;) At least I was somewhat consistent.<br /><br />Thanks
      for pointing this out, will cross-link the two posts.

    html: That works for prefix failover or renumbering, but not for router failure
      detection.

    html: Ahh. The above arose from a discussion on multihomed IPv6 networks without
      BGP or NAT, so yes, a different scenario.

  html: So there is apparently way to make this work without 2s lifetime RAs - if
    you set the AdvValidLifetime and AdvPreferredLifetime fields for the deprecated
    prefix to zero then the route will be withdrawn from users. Courtesy of a discussion
    on the AusNOG list.
