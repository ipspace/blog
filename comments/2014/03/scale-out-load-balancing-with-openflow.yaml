    html: HTTP redirects don&#39;t give you high availability. If a particular back-end
      server fails, all clients redirected to it lose service.

  html: 'There are switches that can do consistent hashing, e.g. Broadcom: http://www.broadcom.com/collateral/wp/StrataXGS_SmartSwitch-WP200-R.pdf<br
    /><br />In this case, upon failure of a switch only 1/N of flows get rehashed
    ( i.e. the ones that were hashing to the failed LB ).<br /><br />In case of a
    web site, couldn&#39;t you simply use a set of HTTP redirect based load balancers?'
