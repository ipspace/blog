It would be interesting to standardize &quot;python-mini profile&quot; (like Java MIDP) for other networking devices, so that &quot;light-weight Salt Minion&quot; and Salt modules can run directly on them.<br /><br />",

      "html": "Tail-F NCS is actually remarkably similar to ODL in many ways, it&#39;s just that ODL is trying to solve a whole slew of problems (by nature, it is actually a platform, built to be modular), and NCS seems to be pretty targeted towards solving some low-hanging configuration problems that exist today (in a pretty impressive manner, by the way). Both understand that the key to this is abstracting away the specific implementations (JunOS vs IOS) and building policy on top of a generic language (i.e. YANG).<br /><br />It&#39;s true that the &quot;new shiny stuff&quot; tends to attract more press and it&#39;s fun to get into debates about these topics that might not impact a lot of folks (at least not yet). <br /><br />My hope is that more folks from these customer environments get into ODL and start contributing, because that&#39;s where the opportunity is right now. The power is in those little scripts and hacks that made their way into production environments because they solved a real problem right away. Others want to use them too!",
