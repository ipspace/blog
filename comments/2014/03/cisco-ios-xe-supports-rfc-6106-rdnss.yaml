  html: 'Question is: Which client operating systems support RFC6106. I know of Linux
    and BSD (if the right software is installed). Last time I checked Windows was
    not supported. Haven&#39;t checked my android tablet / phone recently.'

  html: Hi Ivan,<br /><br />On IOS, it is supported in T train since 15.4(1)T and
    S train (since 15.3(2)S).At least that&#39;s what was told to me from a Cisco
    employee 2 week ago. Haven&#39;t verified it myself<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Christopher

  html: According to the sixth column on this page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_IPv6_support_in_operating_systems),
    there are many client O/Ss with RDNSS support, which is great news.

    html: In this case, it was a bit different. RA was created before DHCPv4, and
      DNS was configured manually in those (pre-DHCP) days. It just took _way_ longer
      for IPv6 to get anything close to feature parity with IPv4.

  html: So I&#39;ve been working with IPv6 for about 3 years now, and the one thing
    that comes to mind particularly in this case and others is that in creating IPv6,
    the various group representatives involved were more interested in getting their
    name on RFC papers by solving problems that had already been solved 30 years ago.<br
    /><br />Is is just me or do we the so called &quot;Internet Generation&quot; of
    engineers lack the ability to recognise that if something is not broken, don&#39;t
    try and fix it. I know DHCPv4 was not perfect, but it is very well tested and
    battle hardened for use in the wider Internet. Sure there are some use cases that
    it has trouble meeting but at the end of the day wouldn&#39;t it be better trying
    to build on that then trying to re-invent things from scratch for the sake of
    a RFC recognition.

  html: Let me ask about the support of RFC6106. I know Linux operation system is
    supported but can you please tell me about software right version to make it working
    ?
