  html: Not so sure about the Trident, but BCM56330 series (powering Juniper ACX amongst
    others) definitely supports MPLS. Control plane is the hard part, only mastered
    by a few...

  html: BCM T+ and T2 both support MPLS. the LFIB isn&#39;t particularly great, but
    if you&#39;re clever you can do some very interesting things with this Si. <br
    /><br />finally, i would recommend a review of the latest segment routing drafts
    and a bit of pondering about how you can build very large networks out of relatively
    modest LFIB enabled devices with segment routing at your disposal.  you don&#39;t
    necessarily need LDP and RSVP to get the job done in an SR domain.

  html: Juniper has been shipping the QFX Series that support MPLS since last year.
    These are Broadcom T1 and T2 chipsets.<br /><br />48x10G, 6x40G<br />32x40G

  html: I am not surprised though that many people believe what was said in the podcast.
    There is a reason that Cisco wont tell you that it is capable in hardware. They
    want to sell you the &quot;special&quot; MPLS hardware at a huge increase in price.
    And account managers and marketing TMEs will pile on the same dribble.

  html: 'We use a CS6500-48S4Q-EI switch based on Broadcom Trident chip and MPLS is
    supported (we run LDP signalled EoMPLS and VPLS). '

  html: Broadcom supports MPLS for a long time. It&#39;s not limited to TD and TD2,
    but a vast range of their chipset portfolio, even some lower cost. You have on
    the market MPLS capable 1G+10G switches, with all the hardware redundancy you
    need, for a few thousands $ (list-price). The only pitfall is about scaling and
    support of newer features.<br /><br />Entropy label? You have to wait for that.<br
    />Scaling? Well, it&#39;s reasonably good on recent chipset (TD2 mainly), it&#39;s
    just a matter of where you want that box. Honestly, if you&#39;re not a Tier1
    SP (or similar), they usually are good enough.<br /><br />This is were Custom
    ASIC still have an edge. But even without a high focus from Broadcom, scaling
    is increased at each generation and will finally be no more &quot;an issue&quot;,
    and features are also added. Not sure MPLS will continue to add rich new features,
    so soon enough, no more discussion here.<br /><br />That being said, as mentioned,
    swaping label is not a challenge. You&#39;ll be linerate on your Tbps+ switch.<br
    /><br />Control Plane is all about the software. But don&#39;t assume to have
    the same features on the merchant silicon based switches with a vendor that has
    custom ASIC dedicated to MPLS (SP) also on their portfolio. You have to adapt
    the code, it&#39;s not trivial.<br /><br />But I&#39;m not saying merchand silicon
    is better than custom ASIC. The latter one gives you opportunity to do greater
    things, to give more control, capability on any kind of protocol where a merchand
    silicon will limit you up to the next gen.

  html: It&#39;s all about software.<br /><br />The moment Vyos codes MPLS features
    (LDP, TE, VPN) then watch vendors completely lose their stuff.<br /><br />Hell,
    it&#39;s almost damn near free right now. Mikrotik RouterOS does it for 45$. I&#39;m
    pretty sure it&#39;d be REAL easy for them to get one of these chipsets and convert
    it to use RouterOS. <br /><br />What it ends up coming down to is that no vendor
    wants to release a device that can do all MPLS related features for cheap because
    it will completely destroy their more ROI products (the more expensive products)
    and therefore they&#39;d make a lot less money.

    \ use Broadcom\xB4s BCM56526. According to configuration guide MPLS/VPLS is supported\

  html: Juniper QFX5100 (Broadcom Trident II) does MPLS very well, especially in P/LSR
    mode.  Forwards up to 3-label stacks.  and yes, it&#39;s all in the software --
    (Auto-BW, LSP/TE, etc)
