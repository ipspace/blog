      "html": "So I&#39;ve been working with IPv6 for about 3 years now, and the one thing that comes to mind particularly in this case and others is that in creating IPv6, the various group representatives involved were more interested in getting their name on RFC papers by solving problems that had already been solved 30 years ago.<br /><br />Is is just me or do we the so called &quot;Internet Generation&quot; of engineers lack the ability to recognise that if something is not broken, don&#39;t try and fix it. I know DHCPv4 was not perfect, but it is very well tested and battle hardened for use in the wider Internet. Sure there are some use cases that it has trouble meeting but at the end of the day wouldn&#39;t it be better trying to build on that then trying to re-invent things from scratch for the sake of a RFC recognition.",
