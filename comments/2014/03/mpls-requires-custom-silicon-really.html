            <div class="comment-content">Not so sure about the Trident, but BCM56330 series (powering Juniper ACX amongst others) definitely supports MPLS. Control plane is the hard part, only mastered by a few...</div>

            <div class="comment-content">BCM T+ and T2 both support MPLS. the LFIB isn&#39;t particularly great, but if you&#39;re clever you can do some very interesting things with this Si. <br /><br />finally, i would recommend a review of the latest segment routing drafts and a bit of pondering about how you can build very large networks out of relatively modest LFIB enabled devices with segment routing at your disposal.  you don&#39;t necessarily need LDP and RSVP to get the job done in an SR domain.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I am not surprised though that many people believe what was said in the podcast. There is a reason that Cisco wont tell you that it is capable in hardware. They want to sell you the &quot;special&quot; MPLS hardware at a huge increase in price. And account managers and marketing TMEs will pile on the same dribble.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Broadcom supports MPLS for a long time. It&#39;s not limited to TD and TD2, but a vast range of their chipset portfolio, even some lower cost. You have on the market MPLS capable 1G+10G switches, with all the hardware redundancy you need, for a few thousands $ (list-price). The only pitfall is about scaling and support of newer features.<br /><br />Entropy label? You have to wait for that.<br />Scaling? Well, it&#39;s reasonably good on recent chipset (TD2 mainly), it&#39;s just a matter of where you want that box. Honestly, if you&#39;re not a Tier1 SP (or similar), they usually are good enough.<br /><br />This is were Custom ASIC still have an edge. But even without a high focus from Broadcom, scaling is increased at each generation and will finally be no more &quot;an issue&quot;, and features are also added. Not sure MPLS will continue to add rich new features, so soon enough, no more discussion here.<br /><br />That being said, as mentioned, swaping label is not a challenge. You&#39;ll be linerate on your Tbps+ switch.<br /><br />Control Plane is all about the software. But don&#39;t assume to have the same features on the merchant silicon based switches with a vendor that has custom ASIC dedicated to MPLS (SP) also on their portfolio. You have to adapt the code, it&#39;s not trivial.<br /><br />But I&#39;m not saying merchand silicon is better than custom ASIC. The latter one gives you opportunity to do greater things, to give more control, capability on any kind of protocol where a merchand silicon will limit you up to the next gen.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">It&#39;s all about software.<br /><br />The moment Vyos codes MPLS features (LDP, TE, VPN) then watch vendors completely lose their stuff.<br /><br />Hell, it&#39;s almost damn near free right now. Mikrotik RouterOS does it for 45$. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;d be REAL easy for them to get one of these chipsets and convert it to use RouterOS. <br /><br />What it ends up coming down to is that no vendor wants to release a device that can do all MPLS related features for cheap because it will completely destroy their more ROI products (the more expensive products) and therefore they&#39;d make a lot less money.</div>
