IBGP works just fine , and I consider it easier operationally and would recommend it over EBGP (having a separate AS for each spoke surely is very painful?). <br />Using dynamic neighbor command, and suitable crypto design, all IBGP neighbors are on same subnet and there is no per-spoke config on the hub. Hub and spokes IBGP peer using Physical DMVPN subnet (update-source TunnelX), so there is no IGP to spokes needed. Spokes only peer with Hub. Hub acts as route-reflector, it all works. Next-hop-self all option gives the option to control whether you are pure-hub and spoke or to allow spoke-to-spoke routing via dynamic tunnel. In our case there is minimal/no spoke-to-spoke so we can set &quot;all&quot;, and/or route-map the hub-spoke peerings to only send default.",

We currently enforce the use of a unique AS per site to ease troubleshooting of routing problems in the SP network, and currently have our DMVPN headend routers configured with static BGP neighbors. <br /><br />In thinking about how we might convert to using dynamic neighbors, it occurred to me that rather than play games with loop prevention, why not simply select an unused AS to represent the DMVPN cloud and apply the appropriate local-as command to the DMVPN BGP peers? Each site remains a separate AS, AS paths correctly reflect the true origin AS, and loop prevention should still work properly, but the DMVPN hub sees all spoke sessions as coming from the common phantom AS, which should allow dynamic neighbors to work just fine.
