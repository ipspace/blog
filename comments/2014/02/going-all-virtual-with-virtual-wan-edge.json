Service agility and automation is going to override the traditional Network/Server/etc. roles especially if the network functions become virtualized and commoditized.  It&#39;s all about coming up with proper templates and methods defined by the networking guys.  <br /><br />Now whether it can be done on x86 hardware or not really just comes down to bandwidth needs.   <br /><br />There are some interesting devices out there now like the Pluribus server/switch thing which kind of blur the lines by integrating a wire speed backplane/switch with actual server hardware and making it open and extensible.  Could be a great NFV platform.  ",

The downside is that something like the CSR may not have drivers for the physical NIC.<br /><br />One thing I haven&#39;t considered is the security consequence of the PCI-passthrough method.
