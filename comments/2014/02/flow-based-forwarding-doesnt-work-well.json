Also, make sure you use a recent version with megaflow support. <br /><br />Beyond that, I hope you do pilots and performance testing before using any untested product in real production deployment, and deploying OVS should be no different.",

      "html": "Great article, I agree with the overall gist with a couple of minor comments (I&#39;m a major OVS contributor full disclosure).<br /><br />That 2500 &quot;flow-eviction-threshold&quot; isn&#39;t actually a hard limit. It&#39;s the number of datapath flows required before the flow eviction process starts at all. The actual number of datapath flows can grow significantly beyond this depending on your traffic patterns. That said, in older versions of OVS, about 10k is about has high as it can scale. The larger point you&#39;re making is correct.<br /><br />You mention that the flow eviction handling moved from the kernel to the userspace ovs-vswitchd daemon. This isn&#39;t actually true, the flow eviction handling has always been handled by the userspace daemon.<br /><br />I&#39;d highly recommend checking out OVS 2.1, we&#39;ve made some major changes in how all this works. That 2500 limit is long gone, with a more realistic limit being in the 100k range (depending on traffic patterns). All in all, the OVS dev community recognizes that this is a major issue and is therefore spending a great deal of time on it. 2.1 is just the beginning, stay tuned =)<br /><br />Ethan",
