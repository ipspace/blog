    html: I&#39;d imagine there&#39;s an assumption that you&#39;d have the servers
      there already to run/serve applications.

    html: If those same L3 switches support all the WAN edge functionality you need,
      you&#39;re absolutely right.

  html: For WAN edge, and in fact any routers short of those needing a full table
    (or to be fair, MPLS, but that&#39;s a software problem) why not just use those
    same L3 switches. In many cases these days the large routers are almost the same
    silicon, just with external lookup RAM, and sometimes buffer RAM.<br />Zero watts
    is a lot cheaper than any Intel server.

    html: I did mention in one of the previous posts (follow the links) that you SHOULD
      use a dedicated network services cluster.

    html: I&#39;m sure they could say the same about the network. I&#39;d jump at
      the chance to learn some of their skills and pass on some of mine. Think like
      that for too much longer and you&#39;ll be limiting your career.<br /><br />Steven

    html: Ivan, why use a dedicated cluster? So long the guest has sufficient resources,
      it shouldn&#39;t really matter on which cluster it runs.

    html: You _might_ need a dedicated cluster for layer 8-10 reasons (see above).<br
      /><br />You _should_ consider a dedicated cluster (if the size of the cloud
      warrants it) because there&#39;s a significant difference between network services
      workloads and traditional server workloads, potentially requiring different
      virtualization ratio or server configuration.

    html: 'DevOps has broken down sysadmin silos in at least some organizations and
      I think the same will happen on the NetOps side.  Service agility and automation
      is going to override the traditional Network/Server/etc. roles especially if
      the network functions become virtualized and commoditized.  It&#39;s all about
      coming up with proper templates and methods defined by the networking guys.  <br
      /><br />Now whether it can be done on x86 hardware or not really just comes
      down to bandwidth needs.   <br /><br />There are some interesting devices out
      there now like the Pluribus server/switch thing which kind of blur the lines
      by integrating a wire speed backplane/switch with actual server hardware and
      making it open and extensible.  Could be a great NFV platform.  '

  html: This would mostly fall under the psychological category, but I prefer to keep
    my network eggs out of the server administrator&#39;s basket.  It&#39;s not that
    this can&#39;t work technically, but I&#39;ve seen storage and configuration issues
    take down virtual clusters more than once.<br />So far, it has been better for
    me to really on my network team to maintain network hardware than to transfer
    responsibility to another team.

    html: '&quot;My stuff!&quot; Unfortunately, too many still hold that their niche
      or technology is what is important. Rather, the delivery of services in the
      most streamlined, secure, and available method is the key. <br /><br />If you
      can have an honest discussion (w/o the turf wars), our datacenters would shrink
      dramatically along with the operational overhead. '

  html: I know the answer but anyway, why isn&#39;t this what everyone is doing? The
    benefits are manyfold, the drawbacks are almost non-existant. Throw in a virtualised
    firewall, load balancer etc and the savings and simplification are enormous. <br

  html: Putting all eggs into one basket would be unwise in this case.<br />The chances
    of a large scale impact of a common-mode is too big a risk for many organisations
    which rely on the network as a critical service.<br /><br />Imagine the virtualised
    edge router, or edge firewall encountering the hypervisor bug which would bring
    down not just the virtualised servers, but bring the network to its knees.<br
    />I can think of a few such bugs - VMware&#39;s e1000 high-load crash bug, VMXNet3
    inability to initiate pptp tunnels, Win2k12R2 purple screen of death (doesn&#39;t
    mean it won&#39;t happen to other new network OS) , to name just a few.<br />

    html: I have heard that L3 switches and software/vm-based routers do not have
      as robust queueing on their interfaces when compared to a dedicated hardware
      router. FWIW, this information came from a vendor of those dedicated hardware
      routers, so there may be some sales hype in there. But they said if you have
      an elaborate QOS policy, some policy-based routing, some intricate ACLs, and
      other features, you will not be happy with the vm or the software solution.
      We haven&#39;t had an opportunity to test this statement

  html: Most of what I&#39;m seeing in the field when I propose this idea is outright
    resistance; most of the reasons are related to exposing the hypervisor directly
    to the Internet and receiving a malformed packet. The scenario mentioned in the
    article, where one uses the PCI-passthrough feature to give a VM direct access
    to a NIC, should provide more security. The downside is that something like the
    CSR may not have drivers for the physical NIC.<br /><br />One thing I haven&#39;t
    considered is the security consequence of the PCI-passthrough method. Does the
    hypervisor still have some kind of wedge in there? We should definitely talk about
    it!
