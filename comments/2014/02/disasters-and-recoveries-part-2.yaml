    html: Unfortunately I&#39;m not that advanced. It&#39;s a small (portable) generator
      and you keep the gas from degenerating by pouring it in when you need it ;)

    \ and how do you keep the Diesel from degenerating ? - just a thought before you\
    \ run into the next mess ;)."

    html: I sincerely doubt that our power companies will learn anything from this
      experience. We get black ice like this every 25 (or so) years and I haven&#39;t
      noticed any significant progress in their power line building technology.

  html: My sympathies Ivan.<br />We experienced same problems here 15 years ago:<br
    />http://archives.radio-canada.ca/environnement/catastrophes_naturelles/dossiers/265/<br
    />and lots of power-lines have been routed underground since then. Pylones have
    also been redesigned:<br />http://www.quebecurbain.qc.ca/archives/jc100_0095b.jpg

      serious front, you get way more bang for the buck if you manage to get the central

  html: Great post and lessons. I just had an outage in my small office in NY recently
    used my labs UPS to carry me for a bit. And I have been in your shoes in the past
    so I empathize what you went through and we get some harsh winters/ice storms
    etc too.  In your case  if for tactical reasons you could have just had some long
    extension cords, space heaters etc to deploy a temp distribution system from generator
    to house to heaters/lights without messing with inside wiring mess from contractor.
    Ugly but quick, easy, mobile and functional.<br /><br />Stay warm

  html: 'Lesson here is the same as always: if you want something done right, you
    have to do it yourself. They&#39;ll of course tell you that you must hire a licensed
    electrician, a licensed plumber and a licensed supervizor a licensed banker to
    finance the operation, etc, etc. But again, if you want things to work at the
    end of the day . . . there is simply no alternative but to do all the critical
    parts of the project yourself.<br />No, i&#39;m not a DIY maniac. I do hire people
    when i have to. But when I need a &quot;life support system&quot; i do it myself,
    even if it takes a long time to get educated and to implement. This approach has
    not failed me so far and yes, I do lose power from time to time, sometimes for
    a week or more.'
