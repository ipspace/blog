            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;ll argue that what I&#39;d like to get to in the industry is some state of consistency. I don&#39;t want to relearn how to do the same thing again, just because the platform is different. I don&#39;t disagree that the best way to configure network services these days is still the CLI. That&#39;s why I&#39;m at one almost always. More choices are coming, but they are as disparate as the vendor.<br /><br />As you say, perhaps its time for us to come up with our own answers, and stop asking the vendors to homogenize what they&#39;ve traditionally sold as differentiators.<br /><br />There&#39;s a longer conversation to be had here.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I don&#39;t mean to sound like a naysayer, but asking for platform-agnostic api to vendors is a bit too much, isn&#39;t it?<br />Isn&#39;t it somewhat like asking for common api to do instrucitons to both Windows and Mac PCs? My understanding is that in the PC world, the Java VM has accomplished abstractions to some extent, but I&#39;m not sure it will happen with our network devices. As a datacenter guy I do automations often, without expecting it&#39;ll happen in the foreseeable future. Most of my batch configuration tools first check sysdescr with each device, then call functions that are specific to the model, which I see is is a necessary evil. That said, some vendors sometimes fail to keep consistency across their own firmware versions and architectures, be it CLI, SNMP oids, or syslog message formats... which is not cool. -tami </div>

            <div class="comment-content">I believe this is just another example of how the networking industry is evolving.  As we demand more from the devices we are deploying in customer networks, we need more efficient ways to gather the data we need, analyze it, and react appropriately.  I have always said, like in programming, the logic can be learned through understanding the standards and then the rest is just syntactical differences.  I agree with Ethan that maybe it&#39;s time we demand a common configuration experience so we spend less time learning how to tell a box to do XYZ protocol correctly which is a huge waste of time in my opinion!<br /><br />I will say that I don&#39;t have much faith in the common network engineer to come up with clever ways of creating a great automation script to make their command line experience easier.  Creating templates to solve repeating problems in the networking industry takes a lot of time in itself, but to see a network engineer take the time to say &quot;Hey, maybe I can write a script in ABC language&quot; is even more difficult to find.  The command line is far from dead.  If we want to make our command line experience better, we need to figure out WHAT problems we are facing, HOW we can fix them with automation, and DEMAND that these tools be built into future software versions.  </div>

            <div class="comment-content">@Jason: nice blog post. It&#39;s great that we&#39;re moving forward in libraries that allow us to read/write native data structures to network devices.<br /><br />The next challenge is working with those data structures: the elements in them have network-wide context, so we need network-wide abstractions to express this. I think this is where networking is trickier than DevOps - the config of a device depends much more on its role in a network than a server, for instance.<br /><br />Python is a great choice - I covered some of the libraries we&#39;re using in AutoNetkit at PyCon AU: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGK5jjyUBCQ<br /><br />@Ivan: I&#39;m not sure we even need Kickstarter. Most of the pieces are already there, and we can engage the academic community to help out. With the right architecture, a lot of the tasks map well to honors or masters projects.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;d forget the vendors here. What&#39;s required here is tool that can talk to every device regardless of vendor via API and translate what you want to do accordingly from a single interface, GUI or CLI. This is very possible as long as the configuration doesn&#39;t relate to non-standard extensions and enhancements. Add in device groups and such like and its even more useful. Let&#39;s get on Kickstarter.<br /><br />Steven Iveson</div>

            <div class="comment-content">The way we managed networks at modest scale was embarrassing compared to technology designed to be intuitive and accessible to non-geeks. At web-scale its a disgrace (Mike Dvorkin nailed it when he called it a crime against humanity at ODL summit) and unacceptable. Imagine if cars could only be driven by auto mechanics or mechanical engineers. Just because this broken model is still the only one available doesn&#39;t mean its good or that this won&#39;t change. People not invested in the status quo are going to fix this. Disruption refuses to be denied.All the people defending buggy whips might want to start learning about the steering wheel.</div>

In either case, 1) we would have to budget for rentals/taxi&#39;s and maybe not own a car and 2) we would be more productive since we would be able to sit in the back seat and get more work done :)<br /><br />Of course, I&#39;m only semi-joking!</div>

The problem is more of a human thing than a technical problem. I had a interview a couple months back I told the VP imagine if we had to use CLI in the webpage. For every discussion and for every post on twitter or facebook or any social media you have to but a command that would put a picture or a comment or a tag. Imagine if you go to your iPhone/Windows phone/Android and you would have to use a cli to open an app. People would not use this.  </div>

            <div class="comment-content">I&#39;m not sick of the CLI. To me, the CLI makes little difference.<br /><br />I&#39;ve worked with many different versions of IOS, XR, NX-OS, PIX/ASA, WebNS, XDI/CatOS, Stratacom OS (whatever that was called), Kalpana OS, etc. etc. ad infinitum. And that&#39;s just Cisco... Plus other vendors’ OSs, including XOS and JunOS.<br /><br />The hard part, to me, has *never* been the CLI. The hard part has always been understanding the task, understanding the technology, and making the right design. After that, it’s just commands... and who cares if that OSPF command is under the interface, under the process, or configured with a &#39;set&#39; command? Meh.<br /><br />I totally agree that some fundamental things in networking need to change. That includes stuff like locator/ID separation (not necessarily through LISP), policies based on address or physical port, troubleshooting larger setups (beyond ping, traceroute, commands to show mac address tables, connecting sniffers multiple places etc.), layer 2 adjacency ‘needs’, and tons of other things.<br /><br />Most of the significant problems in networking is far closer to the top of the list than the CLI.
