    html: We&#39;d all like to get some state of consistency; I&#39;m just saying
      that there&#39;s consistently no consistency across the whole IT industry, and
      most other areas of IT evolved to deal with that fact.<br /><br />Also, here&#39;s
      a nice summary of why we are where we are ;)<br /><br />http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/v6ops/current/msg18631.html

    html: Also, here&#39;s one way of &quot;doing it right&quot;:<br /><br />http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog54/presentations/Tuesday/Morris.pdf<br
      /><br />Obviously this particular solution is not publicly available because
      it&#39;s considered a secret sauce, but imagine what would happen if all the
      brainpower focusing on ODL would decide to do something like this.

    html: 'I don&#39;t mean to sound like a naysayer, but asking for platform-agnostic
      api to vendors is a bit too much, isn&#39;t it?<br />Isn&#39;t it somewhat like
      asking for common api to do instrucitons to both Windows and Mac PCs? My understanding
      is that in the PC world, the Java VM has accomplished abstractions to some extent,
      but I&#39;m not sure it will happen with our network devices. As a datacenter
      guy I do automations often, without expecting it&#39;ll happen in the foreseeable
      future. Most of my batch configuration tools first check sysdescr with each
      device, then call functions that are specific to the model, which I see is is
      a necessary evil. That said, some vendors sometimes fail to keep consistency
      across their own firmware versions and architectures, be it CLI, SNMP oids,
      or syslog message formats... which is not cool. -tami '

  html: I&#39;ll argue that what I&#39;d like to get to in the industry is some state
    of consistency. I don&#39;t want to relearn how to do the same thing again, just
    because the platform is different. I don&#39;t disagree that the best way to configure
    network services these days is still the CLI. That&#39;s why I&#39;m at one almost
    always. More choices are coming, but they are as disparate as the vendor.<br /><br
    />As you say, perhaps its time for us to come up with our own answers, and stop
    asking the vendors to homogenize what they&#39;ve traditionally sold as differentiators.<br
    /><br />There&#39;s a longer conversation to be had here.

    html: '@Jason: nice blog post. It&#39;s great that we&#39;re moving forward in
      libraries that allow us to read/write native data structures to network devices.<br
      /><br />The next challenge is working with those data structures: the elements
      in them have network-wide context, so we need network-wide abstractions to express
      this. I think this is where networking is trickier than DevOps - the config
      of a device depends much more on its role in a network than a server, for instance.<br
      /><br />Python is a great choice - I covered some of the libraries we&#39;re
      using in AutoNetkit at PyCon AU: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGK5jjyUBCQ<br
      /><br />@Ivan: I&#39;m not sure we even need Kickstarter. Most of the pieces
      are already there, and we can engage the academic community to help out. With
      the right architecture, a lot of the tasks map well to honors or masters projects.'

  html: 'I believe this is just another example of how the networking industry is
    evolving.  As we demand more from the devices we are deploying in customer networks,
    we need more efficient ways to gather the data we need, analyze it, and react
    appropriately.  I have always said, like in programming, the logic can be learned
    through understanding the standards and then the rest is just syntactical differences.  I
    agree with Ethan that maybe it&#39;s time we demand a common configuration experience
    so we spend less time learning how to tell a box to do XYZ protocol correctly
    which is a huge waste of time in my opinion!<br /><br />I will say that I don&#39;t
    have much faith in the common network engineer to come up with clever ways of
    creating a great automation script to make their command line experience easier.  Creating
    templates to solve repeating problems in the networking industry takes a lot of
    time in itself, but to see a network engineer take the time to say &quot;Hey,
    maybe I can write a script in ABC language&quot; is even more difficult to find.  The
    command line is far from dead.  If we want to make our command line experience
    better, we need to figure out WHAT problems we are facing, HOW we can fix them
    with automation, and DEMAND that these tools be built into future software versions.  '

  html: I&#39;d forget the vendors here. What&#39;s required here is tool that can
    talk to every device regardless of vendor via API and translate what you want
    to do accordingly from a single interface, GUI or CLI. This is very possible as
    long as the configuration doesn&#39;t relate to non-standard extensions and enhancements.
    Add in device groups and such like and its even more useful. Let&#39;s get on
    Kickstarter.<br /><br />Steven Iveson

    html: Maybe this wouldn&#39;t be so bad.  There would be low level mechanics that
      doubled as taxi drivers and high level that were the specialists.  In either
      case, 1) we would have to budget for rentals/taxi&#39;s and maybe not own a
      car and 2) we would be more productive since we would be able to sit in the
      back seat and get more work done :)<br /><br />Of course, I&#39;m only semi-joking!

  html: The way we managed networks at modest scale was embarrassing compared to technology
    designed to be intuitive and accessible to non-geeks. At web-scale its a disgrace
    (Mike Dvorkin nailed it when he called it a crime against humanity at ODL summit)
    and unacceptable. Imagine if cars could only be driven by auto mechanics or mechanical
    engineers. Just because this broken model is still the only one available doesn&#39;t
    mean its good or that this won&#39;t change. People not invested in the status
    quo are going to fix this. Disruption refuses to be denied.All the people defending
    buggy whips might want to start learning about the steering wheel.

  html: 'Thinking back when I first started in this world in Networking I saw someone
    entering command in CLI and the IT guy looked cool. The problem is more of a human
    thing than a technical problem. I had a interview a couple months back I told
    the VP imagine if we had to use CLI in the webpage. For every discussion and for
    every post on twitter or facebook or any social media you have to but a command
    that would put a picture or a comment or a tag. Imagine if you go to your iPhone/Windows
    phone/Android and you would have to use a cli to open an app. People would not
    use this.  '

  html: "I&#39;m not sick of the CLI. To me, the CLI makes little difference.<br /><br\
    \ />I&#39;ve worked with many different versions of IOS, XR, NX-OS, PIX/ASA, WebNS,\
    \ XDI/CatOS, Stratacom OS (whatever that was called), Kalpana OS, etc. etc. ad\
    \ infinitum. And that&#39;s just Cisco... Plus other vendors\u2019 OSs, including\
    \ XOS and JunOS.<br /><br />The hard part, to me, has *never* been the CLI. The\
    \ hard part has always been understanding the task, understanding the technology,\
    \ and making the right design. After that, it\u2019s just commands... and who\
    \ cares if that OSPF command is under the interface, under the process, or configured\
    \ with a &#39;set&#39; command? Meh.<br /><br />I totally agree that some fundamental\
    \ things in networking need to change. That includes stuff like locator/ID separation\
    \ (not necessarily through LISP), policies based on address or physical port,\
    \ troubleshooting larger setups (beyond ping, traceroute, commands to show mac\
    \ address tables, connecting sniffers multiple places etc.), layer 2 adjacency\
    \ \u2018needs\u2019, and tons of other things.<br /><br />Most of the significant\
    \ problems in networking is far closer to the top of the list than the CLI. Really."
