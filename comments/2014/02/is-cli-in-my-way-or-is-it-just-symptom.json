My understanding is that in the PC world, the Java VM has accomplished abstractions to some extent, but I&#39;m not sure it will happen with our network devices. As a datacenter guy I do automations often, without expecting it&#39;ll happen in the foreseeable future. Most of my batch configuration tools first check sysdescr with each device, then call functions that are specific to the model, which I see is is a necessary evil. That said, some vendors sometimes fail to keep consistency across their own firmware versions and architectures, be it CLI, SNMP oids, or syslog message formats... which is not cool. -tami ",

I don&#39;t want to relearn how to do the same thing again, just because the platform is different. I don&#39;t disagree that the best way to configure network services these days is still the CLI. That&#39;s why I&#39;m at one almost always. More choices are coming, but they are as disparate as the vendor.<br /><br />As you say, perhaps its time for us to come up with our own answers, and stop asking the vendors to homogenize what they&#39;ve traditionally sold as differentiators.<br /><br />There&#39;s a longer conversation to be had here.",

It&#39;s great that we&#39;re moving forward in libraries that allow us to read/write native data structures to network devices.<br /><br />The next challenge is working with those data structures: the elements in them have network-wide context, so we need network-wide abstractions to express this. I think this is where networking is trickier than DevOps - the config of a device depends much more on its role in a network than a server, for instance.<br /><br />Python is a great choice - I covered some of the libraries we&#39;re using in AutoNetkit at PyCon AU: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGK5jjyUBCQ<br /><br />@Ivan: I&#39;m not sure we even need Kickstarter. Most of the pieces are already there, and we can engage the academic community to help out. With the right architecture, a lot of the tasks map well to honors or masters projects.",

      "html": "I believe this is just another example of how the networking industry is evolving.  As we demand more from the devices we are deploying in customer networks, we need more efficient ways to gather the data we need, analyze it, and react appropriately.  I have always said, like in programming, the logic can be learned through understanding the standards and then the rest is just syntactical differences.  I agree with Ethan that maybe it&#39;s time we demand a common configuration experience so we spend less time learning how to tell a box to do XYZ protocol correctly which is a huge waste of time in my opinion!<br /><br />I will say that I don&#39;t have much faith in the common network engineer to come up with clever ways of creating a great automation script to make their command line experience easier.  Creating templates to solve repeating problems in the networking industry takes a lot of time in itself, but to see a network engineer take the time to say &quot;Hey, maybe I can write a script in ABC language&quot; is even more difficult to find.  The command line is far from dead.  If we want to make our command line experience better, we need to figure out WHAT problems we are facing, HOW we can fix them with automation, and DEMAND that these tools be built into future software versions.
