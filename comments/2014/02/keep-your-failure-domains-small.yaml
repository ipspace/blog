  html: 'I am all for limiting failure domains as much as possible. But what would
    you have a small ISP do,  to limit failure domains?<br /><br />Metro Ethernet
    and MPLS Virtual Private LAN service are all the rage, and offers customers the
    promise of being able to connect all their branch offices together, and use the
    same set of VLANs with free Layer 2 connectivity between their sites.<br /><br
    />It seems that the failure domains can&#39;t be limited, because it&#39;s either:  extend
    the failure domains,  or  lose out in selling the service,  b/c  the customer
    will buy from another ISP,  if we are not &quot;buzzword compliant&quot;.<br />'
