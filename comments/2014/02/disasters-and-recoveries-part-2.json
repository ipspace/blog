And I have been in your shoes in the past so I empathize what you went through and we get some harsh winters/ice storms etc too.  In your case  if for tactical reasons you could have just had some long extension cords, space heaters etc to deploy a temp distribution system from generator to house to heaters/lights without messing with inside wiring mess from contractor. Ugly but quick, easy, mobile and functional.<br /><br />Stay warm",

They&#39;ll of course tell you that you must hire a licensed electrician, a licensed plumber and a licensed supervizor a licensed banker to finance the operation, etc, etc. But again, if you want things to work at the end of the day . . . there is simply no alternative but to do all the critical parts of the project yourself.<br />No, i&#39;m not a DIY maniac. I do hire people when i have to. But when I need a &quot;life support system&quot; i do it myself, even if it takes a long time to get educated and to implement. This approach has not failed me so far and yes, I do lose power from time to time, sometimes for a week or more.",
