Makes sense? Not to me.&quot;<br /><br />The majority of networks backing large VMware deployments have been Cisco based. Therefore, VMware prioritized the CDP protocol. It is common in these networks to enable bidirectional CDP so that network operations are able to see the server connectivity within there switches. ",

You can just wait 30 seconds before considering that a link is operational after its link came up. Cisco has been doing that for 15+ years with uplinkfast in order to avoid blackholing when switching over between uplinks;-)<br />As an optimization, you could check the state received in the BPDUs (carried in RSTP/MST) and bypass this 30 second waiting period if possible.",

Other vendors like ALU have also added the ability to run IGPs, RSVP, and LDP over unnumbered interfaces. <br /><br />",
