Fair enough a dev vApp might not have pre knowledge, but couldn&#39;t NSX/vswitch look at outgoing traffic? A profiling feature for the virtualisation team/App Owners, the vswitch knows the vserver name and the parent vapp.<br /><br />Definitely an \u2018enterprise plus\u2019 license feature \uf04a:)",
