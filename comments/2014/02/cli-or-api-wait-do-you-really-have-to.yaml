  html: I have a IP PBX, it use only webgui, but.... The core engine  has API, accessible
    for everybody. PBX wegui is usage example of this API. This way of thinking protects
    them against bad API implementation.

    html: Every time there&#39;s a great idea, someone already implemented it ;))
      Arista EOS has XMPP client which does exactly what you&#39;d like to do.

  html: 'If I have an Api I can code the CLI I like. Even configuting Devices via
    XMPP and your favourite jabber client could be possible. No command completion
    but how cool would that be? or irc. All devices of a single group join a specific
    channel. i.e. all 6500 Switches to #6500 and I can execute a command in the channel
    or do a private chat with each device and I&#39;m sure there is an infinite number
    of ideas on what to do with an API. I don&#39;t think this is a real quwstion.
    it is already answered'

  html: 'Great blog again, Ivan. I agree, it would be nice if the CLI and API aligned
    and &quot;did objects&quot;. Given the history of the CLI in certain (many?) products,
    there&#39;s some serious retrofitting likely needed. Historically, hardware /
    assembly language schooled programmers don&#39;t think in object-oriented code.
    <br /><br />With Cisco&#39;s OnePK, I keep wondering if the API is going to have
    the same semantic drift that the IOS CLI does (similar commands but different
    results on different hardware platforms). '

  html: '@Pete - Be careful what you ask for on CLI/API alignment.  CLIs are for humans
    and may arrange data differently than an API would for a computer.  Maybe the
    requirement should be that one ought to be able to completely control the device
    with either interface without resorting to the other.  Those who do not remember
    the lessons of Bay Networks&#39; &quot;Technician Interface&quot; are doomed to
    repeat its poor choices.  Same comments apply, mutatis mutandis, to TL1.'

  html: Lol, this post slipped through my reader. Great as usual. APIs and networking
    is comical at the moment. While networking vendors haggle over what form of religion
    to use for RPC transport and modeling language, both of which should be irrelevant
    implementation detail, OpenStack continues to define every NaaS API imaginable.
    <br /><br />Personally what I still see missing is a decent GUI. APIs are great
    for provisioning but debugging/tshooting the network with APIs is a recipe for
    pain. Any of the hyperscale shops doing early SDN that I have spoken with have
    plenty of pain on that front. Hell, Vmware took commodity hypervisors and put
    a decent GUI on it and poof. Same for wireless controllers, UC platforms etc.
    I just need to find time to write some crappy GUI. :) Also, v6 and CLIs? I guess
    DNS can alleviate some of the pain but UUIDs and CLIs that would be great to  hand
    type when the DC is down. Whatever we do, I just hope its totally unique to networking
    just to make a mess of it :) Disclaimer I work for RedHat etc.<br /><br />You
    the man Ivan. Maximum Angels per/Pinhead MAP per/sec lolz .<br />-Brent
