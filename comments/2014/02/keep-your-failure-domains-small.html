            <div class="comment-content">I am all for limiting failure domains as much as possible. But what would you have a small ISP do,  to limit failure domains?<br /><br />Metro Ethernet and MPLS Virtual Private LAN service are all the rage, and offers customers the promise of being able to connect all their branch offices together, and use the same set of VLANs with free Layer 2 connectivity between their sites.<br /><br />It seems that the failure domains can&#39;t be limited, because it&#39;s either:  extend the failure domains,  or  lose out in selling the service,  b/c  the customer will buy from another ISP,  if we are not &quot;buzzword compliant&quot;.<br /></div>
