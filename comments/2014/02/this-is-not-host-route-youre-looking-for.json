The proof is left as an exercise for the reader ;)<br /><br />A ToR switch needs to know ARP entries of &quot;connected&quot; devices, which might be a lot more than it seems in case of optimal L3 forwarding (like Arista&#39;s VARP or Enterasys&#39; Fabric Routing).",

In case of hypervisor, it has to learn ARP entries of all the VM&#39;s in that DC&#39;s, where as in case of a hardware device, the ARP entries are just on the connected interface and need not learn ARP&#39;s that are not part of connected interface.",
