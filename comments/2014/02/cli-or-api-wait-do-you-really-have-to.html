            <div class="comment-content">If I have an Api I can code the CLI I like. Even configuting Devices via XMPP and your favourite jabber client could be possible. No command completion but how cool would that be? or irc. All devices of a single group join a specific channel. i.e. all 6500 Switches to #6500 and I can execute a command in the channel or do a private chat with each device and I&#39;m sure there is an infinite number of ideas on what to do with an API. I don&#39;t think this is a real quwstion. it is already answered</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Great blog again, Ivan. I agree, it would be nice if the CLI and API aligned and &quot;did objects&quot;. Given the history of the CLI in certain (many?) products, there&#39;s some serious retrofitting likely needed. Historically, hardware / assembly language schooled programmers don&#39;t think in object-oriented code. <br /><br />With Cisco&#39;s OnePK, I keep wondering if the API is going to have the same semantic drift that the IOS CLI does (similar commands but different results on different hardware platforms). </div>

            <div class="comment-content">@Pete - Be careful what you ask for on CLI/API alignment.  CLIs are for humans and may arrange data differently than an API would for a computer.  Maybe the requirement should be that one ought to be able to completely control the device with either interface without resorting to the other.  Those who do not remember the lessons of Bay Networks&#39; &quot;Technician Interface&quot; are doomed to repeat its poor choices.  Same comments apply, mutatis mutandis, to TL1.</div>

            <div class="comment-content">Lol, this post slipped through my reader. Great as usual. APIs and networking is comical at the moment. While networking vendors haggle over what form of religion to use for RPC transport and modeling language, both of which should be irrelevant implementation detail, OpenStack continues to define every NaaS API imaginable. <br /><br />Personally what I still see missing is a decent GUI. APIs are great for provisioning but debugging/tshooting the network with APIs is a recipe for pain. Any of the hyperscale shops doing early SDN that I have spoken with have plenty of pain on that front. Hell, Vmware took commodity hypervisors and put a decent GUI on it and poof. Same for wireless controllers, UC platforms etc. I just need to find time to write some crappy GUI. :) Also, v6 and CLIs? I guess DNS can alleviate some of the pain but UUIDs and CLIs that would be great to  hand type when the DC is down. Whatever we do, I just hope its totally unique to networking just to make a mess of it :) Disclaimer I work for RedHat etc.<br /><br />You the man Ivan.
