    html: Absolutely not. Like any other product, OVS has its benefits and drawbacks
      that you have to understand and deal with. Also, make sure you use a recent
      version with megaflow support. <br /><br />Beyond that, I hope you do pilots
      and performance testing before using any untested product in real production
      deployment, and deploying OVS should be no different.

  html: Does this mean we shouldn&#39;t use Open vSwitch in any real production deployments?
    Are there better free/open source alternatives?

  html: Unknown packet punting is a problem...  we should discard instead of punting...   and
    have another protocol for discovering  destination addresses, that doesn&#39;t
    rely on punting :)

  html: Great article, I agree with the overall gist with a couple of minor comments
    (I&#39;m a major OVS contributor full disclosure).<br /><br />That 2500 &quot;flow-eviction-threshold&quot;
    isn&#39;t actually a hard limit. It&#39;s the number of datapath flows required
    before the flow eviction process starts at all. The actual number of datapath
    flows can grow significantly beyond this depending on your traffic patterns. That
    said, in older versions of OVS, about 10k is about has high as it can scale. The
    larger point you&#39;re making is correct.<br /><br />You mention that the flow
    eviction handling moved from the kernel to the userspace ovs-vswitchd daemon.
    This isn&#39;t actually true, the flow eviction handling has always been handled
    by the userspace daemon.<br /><br />I&#39;d highly recommend checking out OVS
    2.1, we&#39;ve made some major changes in how all this works. That 2500 limit
    is long gone, with a more realistic limit being in the 100k range (depending on
    traffic patterns). All in all, the OVS dev community recognizes that this is a
    major issue and is therefore spending a great deal of time on it. 2.1 is just
    the beginning, stay tuned =)<br /><br />Ethan
