I&#39;d like to add some accuracy about GLBP: the hosts are not always &quot;forced&quot; to use one or the other exit points: it depends on GLBP mode; what you describe is true with &quot;Host-dependent load balancing&quot;; but for &quot;Weighted load balancing&quot; and &quot;Round-robin load balancing&quot;, it depends...but that&#39;s just a detail.

      "html": "An additional challenge is that RA messages from each router do not provide fast failover. Even if a host flip flops based of a new RA message it is dependent on the timing of the receipt of the RA to begin with. If the router the host is actively using fails (unless it gets an RA prior to the timeout) it will continue to forward traffic to the failed router. This means we are trying to do odd RA timer tuning. I would be interested in seeing how this behavior would impact end to end performance when these timers are out of sync on either end of a WAN - you could potentially have clients that are reachable and others that are not even though all the routing converged around a failure of a device. How this impacts reporting in network monitoring devices and the ability of your network engineers to test will be interesting issues. Just my 2 cents, I&#39;m sure Ivan has thought this through and my concerns are mute ;)<br />- Ed",
