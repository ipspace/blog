  html: Many vendors call these &#39;glean&#39; routes as they are the glue between
    L2 and L3.<br /><br />In EOS btw its explicitly shown via &quot;show ip route
    hosts&quot; (software view of it), or for hardware view you&#39;d use &quot;show
    platform (platformtype) l3 hardware routes host&quot; and &quot;show platform
    (platformtype) l3 hardware routes host lpm&quot;.<br /><br />

    html: Hypervisor needs to know the ARP entries of all VMs in all routing domains
      present in that hypervisor. That might be way less than all VMs in the data
      center. The proof is left as an exercise for the reader ;)<br /><br />A ToR
      switch needs to know ARP entries of &quot;connected&quot; devices, which might
      be a lot more than it seems in case of optimal L3 forwarding (like Arista&#39;s
      VARP or Enterasys&#39; Fabric Routing).

  html: I am not sure if we are comparing apples to apples. In case of hypervisor,
    it has to learn ARP entries of all the VM&#39;s in that DC&#39;s, where as in
    case of a hardware device, the ARP entries are just on the connected interface
    and need not learn ARP&#39;s that are not part of connected interface.
