            <div class="comment-content"><p>It depends if your southbound devices (often firewalls) support routing protocols (preferably BGP). Most enterprises use static routing on WAN edge. So you&#39;ll have to use FHRP on your CE routers. <br />
Also you can&#39;t assume that the default route from your service providers is somewhat reliable. There&#39;s no default route in the internet (hence the name default-free zone). You&#39;ll have to do your own tracking e. g. pinging multiple external destinations. <br />
Normally you don&#39;t need full BGP table. Just filter AS numbers &quot;directly&quot; connected to your service provider (one AS away) and run IBGP session (direct links or BFD) between CE routers to get some more &quot;direct&quot; external routing. All other traffic you catch with your tracked default route. This has also the benefit of comparing peerings between your service providers. Also your routing convergence is much faster.</p>
