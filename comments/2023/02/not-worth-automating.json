Sometimes you get to use what others built, but the scary* part in the open source world is you actually have the freedom to use your own imagination: you can** build something that solves 100% of your use cases instead of hoping a random commercial tool appears that covers maybe half of what you need (and tells you what you should be doing instead of the other way around).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>See previous paragraph.\n**Nothing worthwhile doing is always easy or obvious, and you might need help (e.g. see all of Ivan&#39;s suggestions for broadening your horizon).</li>\n</ul>\n",
