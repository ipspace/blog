            <div class="comment-content"><p>&quot;I can spend 40 hours trying to figure out how to automate something that will only take me 30 minutes and that I will only do ten times a year.&quot;</p>

<p>Which is 40 hours spent learning something new and useful vs. 6 hours of toil that won&#39;t go away.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>For some people, that toil equals job security and there&#39;s no motivation to get better at what they do or push their profession forward. I&#39;m thankful that humanity as a whole doesn&#39;t think this way or we&#39;d still be living like our animal ancestors.</p>

<p>Automation is all about using and building better tools to improve your workflows and their outcomes. Sometimes you get to use what others built, but the scary* part in the open source world is you actually have the freedom to use your own imagination: you can** build something that solves 100% of your use cases instead of hoping a random commercial tool appears that covers maybe half of what you need (and tells you what you should be doing instead of the other way around).</p>

<li>See previous paragraph.
**Nothing worthwhile doing is always easy or obvious, and you might need help (e.g. see all of Ivan&#39;s suggestions for broadening your horizon).</li>
