            <div class="comment-content"><p>I have experienced a case where an enterprise network department returned the new networking devices from a well known and respected vendor, and bought gear from a different vendor.  Sadly I do not know more details, i.e., how bad it really was, but it must have been devastatingly bad, from the problems I often see accepted in networking gear by the networking departments. (Sorry, I am not in a position to name names regarding this.)</p>
