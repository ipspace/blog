         "html": "<p>History can give some insight...</p>\n\n<p>IPv6 was actually seen by some people as IPXv2, with some influence from DECnet. You can get rid of explicit interface addressing and move to node addressing. You could get rid of ARP/ND all together. This is why we have /64 even for point-to-point links, getting rid of ARP/ND. You can easily map IPv6 addresses with MAC addresses. Just embed it. The other functions should be done by some successor of ES-IS. </p>\n\n<p>Then came some other people and destroyed the original clean design. Pity for this...</p>\n",

Because xxx::/127 and xxx::1/127 looks ugly, I usually use xxx::a/127 and xxx::b/127 for aesthetics. It also makes it easier in discussions to refer to the A side or the B side.</p>\n\n<p>And for the /112, talk to Iljitsch &#x1F609;</p>\n",
