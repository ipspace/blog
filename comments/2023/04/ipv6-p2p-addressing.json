You can get rid of explicit interface addressing and move to node addressing. You could get rid of ARP/ND all together. This is why we have /64 even for point-to-point links, getting rid of ARP/ND. You can easily map IPv6 addresses with MAC addresses. Just embed it. The other functions should be done by some successor of ES-IS. </p>\n\n<p>Then came some other people and destroyed the original clean design. Pity for this...</p>\n",
