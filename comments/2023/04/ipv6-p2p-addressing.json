You can get rid of explicit interface addressing and move to node addressing. You could get rid of ARP/ND all together. This is why we have /64 even for point-to-point links, getting rid of ARP/ND. You can easily map IPv6 addresses with MAC addresses. Just embed it. The other functions should be done by some successor of ES-IS. </p>\n\n<p>Then came some other people and destroyed the original clean design. Pity for this...</p>\n",

If I&#39;m unable to create a /127 scope, I&#39;m doomed with a ZTP approach unless I move to /126 (at least) or even /64.</p>\n\n<p>So basically the same issue with IPv4 /31 - with ZTP, you&#39;re somewhat forced to use /30 because of DHCP.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m pretty confident not everybody is aware of that and / or takes that &quot;issue&quot; into consideration for their IP addressing design. So that might turn into a bad surprise later on as the importance for ZTP is raising more than ever with the higher demand for automation.</p>\n",

Even for directly connected routers. If I ran an IPv6-network, I&#39;d want to do the same thing. Link-local IPv6 addresses work fine for this.</p>\n\n<p>So why would people want to manually assign a non-link-local address to their interfaces? The only thing I can think of is so they will be able to ping for troubleshooting. Correct? Are there more reasons?</p>\n\n<p>Pinging a link-local address is a pain, I&#39;d guess. Because you have to look up the remote router&#39;s link-local address first. Not fun. So how can we improve this?</p>\n\n<p>I would guess we need a new flavor of &quot;ping&quot;. <br />\nA ping that only works on p2p interfaces. <br />\nA ping that takes only an outgoing interface-name as argument. <br />\nThe new ping will send out a packet over the p2p interface. <br />\nThe destination-address in the ping-address doesn&#39;t matter. <br />\nThe router on the other end replies anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally the new ping-reply holds a bit more information about the remote router. Like maybe its interface-address, its interface-name, and maybe the hostname of the router. I would assume such a tool would be rather handy, if you often use unnumbered interfaces or link-local addresses.</p>\n\n<p>Can we do this with existing protocols? <br />\nFor IPv4 we could send a ping to the IPv4-broadcast address, or directed-broadcast address. Long time ago, routers would respond to that. Maybe today you can&#39;t ping 255.255.255.255 anymore. And directed-broadcasts are probably not accepted. IPv6 doesn&#39;t have broadcast-addresses. So we&#39;d have to define a new well-known IPv6 multicast-address.</p>\n\n<p>Ping packets can be padded to any size. Can we use the padding to carry TLVs? If so, we could put the if-address, if-name and hostname in a TLV in the ping reply. That should be backwards compatible.</p>\n\n<p>Or else we could use another existing protocol? E.g. extend LLDP to have some sort of ping? One that replies with the if-name, if-address and hostname? Unfortunately LLDP seems to be under the control of IEEE, not IETF. I have no experience working with the IEEE, so I have no idea if this is feasible.</p>\n\n<p>Just an idea. <br />\nOperators, do you think such a new ping would be useful?</p>\n",
