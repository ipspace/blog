            <div class="comment-content"><p>As I recall, DecNet Phase V was considered by its designers to be &quot;the easier solution&quot; for complex networks and was intended to be the network layer routing protocol in OSI. 
http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/decnet/EK-DNAPV-GD_DECnet_Phase_V_General_Description_Sep87.pdf</p>

<p>My experience was limited to DecNet Phase IV and the wonders of interconnecting multiple sites all of which had chosen to be in Area 1 (IIRC - this was in the 1990s).</p>

<p>DecNet Phase V and OSI didn&#39;t get widely adopted despite a major push including government requirements to deploy it. This wasn&#39;t surprising given the cost of the OSI software licenses et al compared to the zero cost of open source TCP/IP.</p>
