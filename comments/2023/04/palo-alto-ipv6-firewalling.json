This is a device wide settings, which means that it does not only impact virtual wires. Once the checkbox is enabled, however, they do ipv6 firewalling, even if I never had the chance to try and evaluate their efficiency on the matter... </p>\n\n<p>For the L2 security part, I must only agree. It sad they don&#39;t incorporate a minimal amount of L2 security in a virtual wire setting...</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps the debate! </p>\n",
