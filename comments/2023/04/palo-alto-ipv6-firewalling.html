            <div class="comment-content"><p>It&#39;s not only a firewall problem. Ignoring or not having IPv6 security in e.g. wireless equipment can also be a lot of fun (or not, depending on which side you are on). If you don&#39;t care about IPv6 you&#39;ll probably don&#39;t care about any of the IPv6 security features. </p>

<p>Imagine a guest network in a hotel and some modern entertainment systems in the rooms. Guest should be able to stream music from their phone to the audio system and videos to the TV in their rooms. Client isolation on the wireless probably won&#39;t work because of this. </p>

<p>Now comes the attacker (which might be a bored guest) and announces an IPv6 prefix + DNS via RA .... </p>

<p>PS: I always wanted to implement this feature on something like an ESP8266 and hide that in an USB outlet. ;-) </p>
