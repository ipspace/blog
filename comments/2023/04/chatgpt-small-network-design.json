Router A is connected to routers B and C, router D is connected to routers B and C. Each router has a loopback interface. Can you generate a Cisco configuration for these routers, so router A will be able to reach loopbacks of routers B,C and D?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And the result of this is exactly the same as your GPT-4 response except I got wider network mask /24 than /30, but it is a working configuration. \nThe simpler the GPT model, the clearer and precise the query should be (this works with humans as well).</p>\n",
