            <div class="comment-content"><p>Ivan, unless they added the GPT4 to the free tier, it&rsquo;s all apples and oranges comparison :-)</p>

<p>My 2c: get GPT+ and use GPT4 - you will see the difference. GPT4 still has &ldquo;the terminator line of bullshit&rdquo;, and still needs the fact-check, but it usually is more informative.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the tidbit of the convo for the last prompt, it doesn&rsquo;t sound too terrible to me:</p>

<p>Me: Which CRC algorithm is Ethernet using?</p>

<p>GPT4: Ethernet uses a specific 32-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) algorithm known as CRC-32. More precisely, Ethernet employs the CRC-32C (Castagnoli) variant, which is defined by the polynomial 0x1EDC6F41. This variant is known for its excellent error detection capabilities and is widely used in many communication protocols and applications.</p>

<p>The CRC-32C algorithm calculates the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) based on the frame&#39;s data and appends it to the end of the frame before transmission. Upon receiving the frame, the recipient calculates the CRC-32C value based on the received data and compares it with the received FCS. If the calculated value matches the received FCS, the frame is considered error-free. If not, an error is detected, and the frame is discarded.</p>

<p>The CRC-32C algorithm is effective at detecting various types of transmission errors, such as single-bit errors, burst errors, and errors caused by noise or interference, ensuring data integrity at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.</p>

<p>Q: Why is there an application-level checksum in iSCSI?
A:
<pre>
iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface) is a protocol used for transmitting SCSI commands over a network. It is a block-level storage protocol and is used for providing access to storage devices such as hard drives, tape drives, and optical drives over a network. iSCSI uses TCP/IP as the transport protocol, which makes it possible to transmit SCSI commands over an IP network. [0]

One of the important features of iSCSI is the use of checksums for ensuring data integrity. The data that is transmitted over the network can be corrupted due to various reasons such as network congestion, packet loss, or hardware failures. To ensure that the data is not corrupted during transmission, iSCSI uses a checksum mechanism. The checksum is calculated at both the application level and the network level. At the application level, iSCSI uses a header and data digest to ensure that the data is not corrupted during transmission. The header digest is calculated over the iSCSI header, while the data digest is calculated over the data payload. [0]

The header digest is calculated using the CRC32 algorithm, while the data digest is calculated using one of the following algorithms: CRC32C, CRC32K, or CRC32D. These algorithms are designed to provide fast and efficient checksum calculations. [4]

The use of checksums in iSCSI is important for ensuring data integrity. The data that is transmitted over the network is critical, and any corruption can result in data loss or corruption. The use of checksums ensures that the data is not corrupted during transmission and that the data received is the same as the data that was transmitted. [0]

One of the disadvantages of using checksums is the overhead that it adds to the transmission. The checksum calculation requires additional processing power, which can reduce the overall performance of the system. However, the benefits of using checksums outweigh the disadvantages, and it is recommended to use checksums for ensuring data integrity. [0]

In addition to using checksums, there are other measures that can be taken to ensure the security and reliability of iSCSI. One such measure is the use of CHAP (Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol) for authentication. CHAP is a protocol that is used for authenticating users over a network. It is a one-way or mutual authentication protocol that provides a secure way of authenticating users. Another measure that can be taken is the use of nonblocking switches to ensure that the data is transmitted without any delays or disruptions. [3]

In conclusion, iSCSI is a protocol used for transmitting SCSI commands over a network. It uses TCP/IP as the transport protocol and checksums to ensure data integrity. The use of checksums is important for ensuring that the data is not corrupted during transmission, but it adds overhead to the transmission. There are other measures that can be taken to ensure the security and reliability of iSCSI, such as the use of CHAP for authentication and nonblocking switches. [0][3]
