No M-LAG, VLANs does not span over multiple racks. There are some caveats since does not yet support accelerated datapath like DPDK. Maybe someone will add ES-IS to FRR in the near future... </p>\n\n<p>https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/09/22/learn-about-new-bgp-capabilities-red-hat-openstack-17#</p>\n",

Indeed asking the host HSRP ish protocol to reach the DG/NH or not that would be good. FRR looks good, we did OSPF on LANs in my BT time for stacks of pizza&#39;s and what came after that. Not so sure if BGP in the ToR boils my cookie. But great article thanks.    </p>\n",
