            <div class="comment-content"><p>If you happen to run bare metal kubernetes/openshift with e.g. Calico or Cilium CNI, running BGP between server and ToR almost becomes the default deployment.
Obviously, now we&#39;re not in enterprise IT virtualisation territory anymore (although kubevirt could <em>functionally</em> provide most of the desired technology...)</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>The answer is BGP + BFD. This project adds FRR on each server and then advertise all host and potentially also client VM IPs as /32 routes to the leafs. No M-LAG, VLANs does not span over multiple racks. There are some caveats since does not yet support accelerated datapath like DPDK. Maybe someone will add ES-IS to FRR in the near future... </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>amazing article Ivan. What i ran into the other day was a switch fault resitting the config to vanilla so SW port is up / NIC is up and forwarding, into nowhere. server dies. Indeed asking the host HSRP ish protocol to reach the DG/NH or not that would be good. FRR looks good, we did OSPF on LANs in my BT time for stacks of pizza&#39;s and what came after that. Not so sure if BGP in the ToR boils my cookie. But great article thanks.    </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>The routed way is definitely good, at the cost perhaps of some complexity you <em>see</em>.</p>

<p>One annoyance is what IP address gets used by default by the system for outbound traffic.  It would be nice to have a generic OS-level way to say &quot;this IP on lo0 should be default for outbound IP traffic unless to the connected link subnet itself&quot;.</p>

<p>Obviously some software allows you to specify the source IP to use, but again more complexity in config.  And some doesn&#39;t.  I&#39;ve solved it before with an iptables/nft SNAT rule for everything not on the connected subnet, but again it&#39;s messier than one would like.  </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>A few other tricks (I guess I&#39;ll have to write a follow-up blog post one of these days):</p>

<ul>
<li>Assign the same IP address to the loopback and all uplinks. Obviously that makes running BGP sessions a bit harder, so you have to run them over IPv6 LLA</li>
<li>Don&#39;t care about the outbound sessions (too much)</li>
<li>Use MP-TCP for outbound sessions</li>
<li>Use MPIO for iSCSI</li>
</ul>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>The IPv6 link-local is a very nice approach alright (even better when combined with automatic neighbor discovery).  You could probably get away without the IP on each uplink in a lot of cases as the system will pick a GUA/IPv4 from the loopback if it&#39;s the only choice.</p>
