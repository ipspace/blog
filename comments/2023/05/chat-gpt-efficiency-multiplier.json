They all know $vendor configuration lingo well enough to configure it, but most of time every customer has its own intricacies (the aforementioned context) which makes it interesting. It&#39;s at that inflection point where <em>what</em> you know meets the <em>why</em>. ChatGPT can help with the what question but can never replace the <em>why</em>. That&#39;s where skill, experience and attitude come in.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize the summary: Context is king and ChatGPT won&#39;t replace that anytime soon.</p>\n",
