            <div class="comment-content"><p>I think it can be summarized as &quot;ChatGPT provides the content whereas we as humans need to put that in the right <em>context</em>&quot; It&#39;s one of things I am trying to achieve when dealing with lots of engineers working for different customers. They all know $vendor configuration lingo well enough to configure it, but most of time every customer has its own intricacies (the aforementioned context) which makes it interesting. It&#39;s at that inflection point where <em>what</em> you know meets the <em>why</em>. ChatGPT can help with the what question but can never replace the <em>why</em>. That&#39;s where skill, experience and attitude come in.</p>

<p>To summarize the summary: Context is king and ChatGPT won&#39;t replace that anytime soon.</p>
