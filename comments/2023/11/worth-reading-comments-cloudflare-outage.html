            <div class="comment-content"><p>It reads like they are going to migrate from centralized control plane to distributed control plane and aiming for partition tolerance. But according to CAP theorem they will have to either give up availability or consistency. At the same time they want to stick with &quot;the high availability cluster (if they rely on any of our core data centers)&quot;. To me these look like conflicting goals. Also it seems to me they are caught in a complexity trap. Thought that shop would do better specially with testing, recovery planning and organization.  </p>

<p>BTW I know of a outsourcing provider which test their diesel generators and UPS every month because they know for sure that their crappy &quot;active-active redundant data clusters&quot; will not survive a complete outage of one data center. So their weakest &quot;link&quot; really is electricity. They also have an impressive stock of diesel at the facility to be able to run independently for days.</p>
