But according to CAP theorem they will have to either give up availability or consistency. At the same time they want to stick with &quot;the high availability cluster (if they rely on any of our core data centers)&quot;. To me these look like conflicting goals. Also it seems to me they are caught in a complexity trap. Thought that shop would do better specially with testing, recovery planning and organization.  </p>\n\n<p>BTW I know of a outsourcing provider which test their diesel generators and UPS every month because they know for sure that their crappy &quot;active-active redundant data clusters&quot; will not survive a complete outage of one data center. So their weakest &quot;link&quot; really is electricity. They also have an impressive stock of diesel at the facility to be able to run independently for days.</p>\n",
