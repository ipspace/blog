Along with dependency checking between parts of the device config.</p>\n\n<p>I know there are tools for the second part that can be integrated but most require you to configure the rules to check. Something that does basic sanity checks out of the box for &quot;you setup EVPN but don&#39;t have BGP setup&quot; etc. in the IDE would make greater adoption of network automation far easier. If you use JunOS there are some really good options (from the community) anything else out of luck.</p>\n",
