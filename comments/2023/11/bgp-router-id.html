            <div class="comment-content"><p>It&#39;s funny I did the same test with Cisco and Arista a while back after getting a design where customer wanted to peer across their firewall to the same switch but different vrf. I was curious if direct peer with the firewall was the only option or if multihop across the firewall was possible. The test uncovered what you described and some additional frustrations around limitations with local-as replace-as when peeing to the firewall. IOS can&#39;t set AS per vrf and local-as replace-as has limitations on iBGP and eBGP peerings it will allow based on the global AS. Arista was most flexible and NX-OS was better than IOS because you can at least set AS per vrf....  Fun times with funny designs! :)</p>
