            <div class="comment-content"><p>There&#39;s a reason why Cisco is giving out a lot of free CE credits for recertification lately. Still you have to invest time into their products. Seems demand is heading to certifications from cloud providers where Cisco has no foothold.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>I let mine lapse last year.  I&#39;d held it since 2015 and at the time if felt like a massive achievement to have got through it, when I came to recertify this time around I just couldn&#39;t see the value in it vs putting time into AWS/Azure.  </p>
