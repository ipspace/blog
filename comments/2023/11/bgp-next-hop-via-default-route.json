         "html": "<p>I faced this problem some years ago. I wanted the BGP route to get invalid when there is no available /32 route for the next-hop. In IOS you can do this with Selective BGP Next-Hop Route Filtering (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_bgp/configuration/xe-3s/irg-xe-3s-book/bgp-support-for-next-hop-address-tracking.html). The command is &ldquo;bgp next-hop route-map xxx&rdquo;. So the route-map could match only the prefix of your network&rsquo;s loopbacks.</p>\n\n<p>You can achieve the same for fast neighbor deactivation when there is no specific route for the neighbors address. neighbor xxx fall-over route-map xxxx.</p>\n",
