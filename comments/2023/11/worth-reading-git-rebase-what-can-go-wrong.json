Once stuff is in a commit, git doesn&#39;t forget it for quite a while, it can just be tricky to find it again.</p>\n\n<p>I also tend to push a branch before I do a lot of rebase work so I can always <code>git reset --hard @&amp;#123;u&amp;#125;</code> to get back to what I had before I started work.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, if my commit history is too messy to clean up, I&#39;ll adopt Annie Sexton&#39;s method and just toss the commit history and generate new commits.</p>\n\n<p>https://render.com/blog/git-organized-a-better-git-flow</p>\n\n<p>Using this method in conjunction with <code>git add --patch ...</code> (can stage changes a hunk at a time) or a tool like tig/gitui that can stage individual lines at a time can make really readable commit histories.</p>\n",
