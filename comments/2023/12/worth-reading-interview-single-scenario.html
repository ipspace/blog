            <div class="comment-content"><p>I used to try to do that. Having  <em>SIMPLE</em> question as described in the blog is key. When I was involved in interviewing (a while back!), it was usually medium to expert level people though. I tried running various recent things I&#39;d encountered in the field by them. Mixed success ... it takes time to describe a complex scenario, and interviews can be scary enough to cause brain freeze in the candidates. I did end up with a small &quot;fun&quot; set of weirdly broken network situations eventually. </p>
