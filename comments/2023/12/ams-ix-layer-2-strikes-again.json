               "html": "<p>As above, it&#39;s only two vendors, and for many years it was only Brocade/Extreme. It&#39;s only this year they turned up Juniper devices. They had to do something about 100G/400G, and changing vendors was a reasonable choice. https://www.juniper.net/us/en/customers/ams-ix-case-study.html (published 2022, but it&#39;s only this year that Juniper equipment has gone into production there)</p>\n\n<p>Sticking with one vendor forever because you&#39;re scared of interop gives you no negotiating leverage, and may mean you&#39;re stuck - e.g. I don&#39;t think Extreme Networks is shipping any 400G gear, so what do you do? But even if you&#39;ve decided to completely swap to Juniper, you can&#39;t do that in one step. You have to have some interoperability for a while. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think the XKCD thing is relevant here. It&#39;s not a case of relying on a forgotten utility maintained by a volunteer, this is AMS-IX&#39;s core product. It is everything they do. And it&#39;s not a case of service providers being unwilling to put money into IXPs. AMS-IX is not a charity running on donations. See https://peering.exposed. The SPs and CDNs who are AMS-IX customers are paying a decent amount.</p>\n\n<p>I also don&#39;t think that AMS-IX is quite so mission-critical any more. Yes, it does a fair bit of traffic, but there are multiple other IXPs in Amsterdam. If you really care about your connectivity, you are connected to at least two of those, in addition to a mesh of PNIs and transit connections. </p>\n\n<p>(Background: my employer peers at many locations, including AMS-IX. I do not speak for them, etc etc)</p>\n",

I would not expect LACP to ingress a VPLS network <em>by default</em> (many vendors, e.g., <a href=\"https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/multicast-l2/topics/topic-map/layer-2-protocol-tunneling.html\">Juniper</a>, use Layer 2 Protocol Tunneling (L2PT) to allow transport of such protocols after specific configuration; Cisco called this <em>Generic Bridge PDU Tunneling (GBPT)</em>).</p>\n\n<p>&sup1; The Brocade MLX routers are part of what Extreme Networks purchased from the Brocade parts Broadcom did not want to keep, as are the SLX routers.</p>\n",
