I would not expect LACP to ingress a VPLS network <em>by default</em> (many vendors, e.g., <a href=\"https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/multicast-l2/topics/topic-map/layer-2-protocol-tunneling.html\">Juniper</a>, use Layer 2 Protocol Tunneling (L2PT) to allow transport of such protocols after specific configuration; Cisco called this <em>Generic Bridge PDU Tunneling (GBPT)</em>).</p>\n\n<p>&sup1; The Brocade MLX routers are part of what Extreme Networks purchased from the Brocade parts Broadcom did not want to keep, as are the SLX routers.</p>\n",
