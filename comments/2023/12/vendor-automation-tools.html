            <div class="comment-content"><p>Garbage in and garbage out first coined by IBM programmer named George Fuechsel in 1962.  You cannot automate garbage and expect it to become something else.
I have spend too many wasted hours on Teams call boilers staring at networking UIs that are clunky using clumsy interfaces with related settings in 40 different places.  Never mind the unknown error codes.
My opinion is that all the existing deployments can be decommissioned and a clean slate automation from scratch will be the most productive use of time.</p>
