Neither giaddr nor broadcast mode will get it there. We need the tunnel&#39;s NBMA address.</p>\n\n<p>The hub/relay packs the sender/client NBMA address into option 82 when relaying messages from the client, and then relies on that same field to target the server replies back toward the client.</p>\n",
