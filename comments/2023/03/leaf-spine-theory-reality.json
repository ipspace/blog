Updated.</p>\n\n<p>Although I disagree with mentioning QFX5120 in the same sentence -- it&#39;s just that they cannot use breakout cables on more than 24 100GE links ;) I also can&#39;t figure out how you get from 64 ports to 8 uplinks + 24 ports with breakout cables, but that&#39;s just me ;)</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I added an extra bullet describing the breakout cables option. Thanks a million for pointing me in that direction!</p>\n\n<p>Ivan</p>\n",

Looks like the ASICs are too fast and the vendors don&#39;t use all the lanes.</p>\n\n<p>Example: Trident3 has 128 25GE lanes, Arista 7050SX3-48YC8 has 48 x 25GE and 8 x 100GE ports for a total of 80 25GE lanes (leaving 48 lanes unused) and 1,5:1 oversubscription factor.

The over-subscription factor depends on the fabric design - you could do 1:1 by using 16 ports for servers, and the rest as uplinks (for example), up to 30:2 (15:1) by using only 2 uplinks</p>\n\n<p>So it&#39;s not really the case that &quot;the ASICs are too fast&quot;, the same ASIC is used in different designs offering different design trade-offs (and price points)</p>\n",
