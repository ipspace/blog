Several major Internet service providers, including Comcast and Verizon, reported issues with network connectivity, and some users experienced service outages.</p>\n\n<p>The BGP attribute that was being tested was a new feature that allowed for more efficient routing of traffic. However, the mistake in the configuration caused the attribute to be propagated to networks that were not prepared to handle it, which caused the widespread disruption.</p>\n\n<p>The disruption caused by this mistake highlights the importance of testing new BGP features carefully before they are deployed to production networks. It also shows the importance of having a plan in place for dealing with disruptions when they do occur.</p>\n\n<p>Sources - Learn more\nblog.ipspace.net/2023/03/chatgpt-bgp-routing-security.html</p>\n\n<p>Q2: When did a RIPE researcher testing unknown BGP attributes cause Internet disruption?</p>\n\n<p>A2: There was no recorded instance of a RIPE researcher testing unknown BGP attributes causing Internet disruption.</p>\n",
