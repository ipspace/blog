            <div class="comment-content"><p>Keen to see the next post as I fought with inter VRF DHCP relay on Cisco XR for some time in a lab and can&#39;t remember the version but got no help as the hardware didn&#39;t reproduce the problem.</p>

<p>Even in CML2 packet comes in from the client (I had it come over a VPLS in one VRF), then relayed to the server (on a physical port in the main vrf), the response comes back to the box and it would get dropped no logs nothing. Add ACL, remove ACL, moving interfaces between VRFs, added full routing between VRFs, nothing.</p>
