            <div class="comment-content">May I add another potential drawback of external links on spine switches:<br />

<p>Depending on the routing architecture of the fabric, it may also be advisable to have direct links between the spines to run iBGP, in which case you lose even more interfaces on the spines.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>You also need to let the spines participate in VXLAN (overlay). They usually don&rsquo;t need VXLAN because they are just forwarding between the Leafs (underlay). It all adds to the complexity and table sizes for switches that usually only need to be fast. </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>&gt; connect external links to a dedicated pair of leaf switches</p>

<p>Is dedicated really necessary?  I would have thought that connecting external links to <em>any</em> pair of leaf switches would achieve the same outcome.  A leaf switch pair might serve a physical physical rack, and if your external connectivity is housed in that rack (with or without &quot;internal&quot; server hardware) then you would simply connect to them.</p>
