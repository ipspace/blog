            <div class="comment-content">May I add another potential drawback of external links on spine switches:<br />

<p>Depending on the routing architecture of the fabric, it may also be advisable to have direct links between the spines to run iBGP, in which case you lose even more interfaces on the spines.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>You also need to let the spines participate in VXLAN (overlay). They usually don&rsquo;t need VXLAN because they are just forwarding between the Leafs (underlay). It all adds to the complexity and table sizes for switches that usually only need to be fast. </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>&gt; connect external links to a dedicated pair of leaf switches</p>

<p>Is dedicated really necessary?  I would have thought that connecting external links to <em>any</em> pair of leaf switches would achieve the same outcome.  A leaf switch pair might serve a physical physical rack, and if your external connectivity is housed in that rack (with or without &quot;internal&quot; server hardware) then you would simply connect to them.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Yes you can connect them whereever you like. Border or Edge Leafs are just Leafs. But it&#39;s a best practice to have a dedicated pair of Border Leafs. Maybe you even need different switches from the rest of your datacenter because there are a lot of copper ports. Or you have a lot of legacy servers with 1/10G copper and your border is all fiber. Then you just need different hardware. 
For the configuration, it&#39;s not that different and every leaf can do it. </p>

            <div class="comment-content">Back in 2021 when I was being put through the Nvidia Cumulus training the advice they gave was that: If your traffic is mostly East-West then use dedicated leafs, if it is mostly North-South then put it on the spines.<br />
