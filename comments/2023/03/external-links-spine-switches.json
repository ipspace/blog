Maybe you even need different switches from the rest of your datacenter because there are a lot of copper ports. Or you have a lot of legacy servers with 1/10G copper and your border is all fiber. Then you just need different hardware. \nFor the configuration, it&#39;s not that different and every leaf can do it. </p>\n",

I would have thought that connecting external links to <em>any</em> pair of leaf switches would achieve the same outcome.  A leaf switch pair might serve a physical physical rack, and if your external connectivity is housed in that rack (with or without &quot;internal&quot; server hardware) then you would simply connect to them.</p>\n",
