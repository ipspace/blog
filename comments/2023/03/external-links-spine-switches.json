I would have thought that connecting external links to <em>any</em> pair of leaf switches would achieve the same outcome.  A leaf switch pair might serve a physical physical rack, and if your external connectivity is housed in that rack (with or without &quot;internal&quot; server hardware) then you would simply connect to them.</p>\n",
