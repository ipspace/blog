            <div class="comment-content"><p>DHCP in EVPN/VXLAN (with anycast) is so evil that we&#39;re thinking of running standalone DHCP Relay servers in vrfs outside EVPN/VXLAN.</p>

<p>Why do I mean by evil (or maybe just badly implemented in our kit): </p>

<ul>
<li>DHCP requests going to old servers that are no longer configured</li>
<li>DHCP requests being mangled for IRBs that are not configured for it</li>
<li>DHCP requests going nowhere: debug traces say &quot;DHCP packet being forwarded&quot; but if you capture all the traffic from all interfaces... it&#39;s nowhere to be seen.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;d strongly recommend anybody that has to use this to get a complete understanding of how it&#39;s supposed to work, it&#39;s not a simple &quot;configure ip helper address on the respective IRBs and you&#39;re done&quot;</p>
