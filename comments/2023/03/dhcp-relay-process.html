            <div class="comment-content"><p>DHCP in EVPN/VXLAN (with anycast) is so evil that we&#39;re thinking of running standalone DHCP Relay servers in vrfs outside EVPN/VXLAN.</p>

<p>Why do I mean by evil (or maybe just badly implemented in our kit): </p>

<ul>
<li>DHCP requests going to old servers that are no longer configured</li>
<li>DHCP requests being mangled for IRBs that are not configured for it</li>
<li>DHCP requests going nowhere: debug traces say &quot;DHCP packet being forwarded&quot; but if you capture all the traffic from all interfaces... it&#39;s nowhere to be seen.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;d strongly recommend anybody that has to use this to get a complete understanding of how it&#39;s supposed to work, it&#39;s not a simple &quot;configure ip helper address on the respective IRBs and you&#39;re done&quot;</p>

<p>A related and fun rabbit trail is when you&#39;re using DHCP for DMVPN spokes.</p>

<p>There&#39;s some unicast levers which need to be pulled, but more interesting is how the relay (the DMVPN hub) delivers the Offer and Ack to the DMVPN spoke. Neither giaddr nor broadcast mode will get it there. We need the tunnel&#39;s NBMA address.</p>

<p>The hub/relay packs the sender/client NBMA address into option 82 when relaying messages from the client, and then relies on that same field to target the server replies back toward the client.</p>
