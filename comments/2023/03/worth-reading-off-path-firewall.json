PBR is usually implemented with the same lookup hardware as ACLs, so there&#39;s pretty high chance that a platform that can do packet filters in hardware could also do simple PBR in hardware.</p>\n\n<p>Even better, as the IP address of the backup server is usually well-known, you could easily turn this into a pure routing challenge.
