            <div class="comment-content"><p>Why do we need Proxy ARP? Is it used for the ARP surpression? 
I already built a few VXLAN Fabrics, always with Arista. But I certainly lack a few basics, maybe because I just learned while building the first fabric and sometimes trial and error was faster than searching for the right explanation/documentation. 
But I can answer almost all questions. I only don&#39;t know the two interoperability questions, but I also never build a VXLAN fabric with two vendors. So, is it possible now to build one large fabric consisting of multiple vendors? Would somebody really do that?
Our customers want reliability and support in times of need, most of them just grasp the basics of those fabrics. Not one of them wants to build a fabric by themself or deal with multiple vendors. </p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>&gt; Why do we need Proxy ARP? Is it used for the ARP suppression?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>&gt; So, is it possible now to build one large fabric consisting of multiple vendors?</p>

<p>As long as it&#39;s a single fabric and you don&#39;t do VXLAN-to-VXLAN bridging, the answer is a definitive YES.</p>

<p>&gt; Would somebody really do that?</p>

<p>In principle, NO. In practice, life might intervene. It&#39;s a great question though worthy of another blog post.</p>
