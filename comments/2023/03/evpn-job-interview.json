But I certainly lack a few basics, maybe because I just learned while building the first fabric and sometimes trial and error was faster than searching for the right explanation/documentation. \nBut I can answer almost all questions. I only don&#39;t know the two interoperability questions, but I also never build a VXLAN fabric with two vendors. So, is it possible now to build one large fabric consisting of multiple vendors? Would somebody really do that?\nOur customers want reliability and support in times of need, most of them just grasp the basics of those fabrics. Not one of them wants to build a fabric by themself or deal with multiple vendors. </p>\n",
