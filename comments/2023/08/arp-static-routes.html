            <div class="comment-content"><p>The behavior of Arista EOS to use recursive next-hop resolution for static routes can be surprising, since most other router implementations do not do that.  One common expectation, satisfied by many router implementations, is that a static route with only an IP as next-hop specification is only active in the routing table (and installed in the forwarding database) when the next hop lies in a directly connected subnet of an active interface.</p>

<p>The Linux <em>kernel</em> implementation for static routes is different from both Arista EOS and usual router implementations in that a static route stays active when the outgoing interface goes down, creating a blackhole. (Current userspace, e.g., NetworkManager, removes static routes pointing to inactive interfaces.)</p>

<p>(BTW, the <em>Baron M&uuml;nchhausen</em> static route <code>ip route 10.1.0.5/32 ethernet 2 10.1.0.5</code> is technically identical to <code>ip route 10.1.0.5/32 ethernet 2</code>, thus there is no reason to expect it to work differently. ;-) )</p>

<p>That&#39;s good to know. Thank you!</p>

<p>You can get the exact same behavior with <strong>permanent</strong> option of <strong>ip route</strong> command on Cisco IOS.</p>

<p>Also, at least some IGP routes stay in the routing table after the interface failure, see https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/12/what-happens-after-link-failure.html for details.</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hello. I have a network with nexus 7000 and 9000 as a core routers. And a static routes pointing to the clients vlan interfaces. And on nexus 7000 I see a strange behavior: if I create a route to a server for ex. ip route 1.1.1.1/32 vlan 113 the router doesn&#39;t add arp record for 15 min., until adjacency manager adds such route automatically. Then the network on the server starts working. In the same time on nexus 9000 arp record is added immediately. 
If you can - please help to resolve this issue. I can provide any additional info needed. Thanks in advance.</p>
