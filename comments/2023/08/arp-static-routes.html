            <div class="comment-content"><p>The behavior of Arista EOS to use recursive next-hop resolution for static routes can be surprising, since most other router implementations do not do that.  One common expectation, satisfied by many router implementations, is that a static route with only an IP as next-hop specification is only active in the routing table (and installed in the forwarding database) when the next hop lies in a directly connected subnet of an active interface.</p>

<p>The Linux <em>kernel</em> implementation for static routes is different from both Arista EOS and usual router implementations in that a static route stays active when the outgoing interface goes down, creating a blackhole. (Current userspace, e.g., NetworkManager, removes static routes pointing to inactive interfaces.)</p>

<p>(BTW, the <em>Baron M&uuml;nchhausen</em> static route <code>ip route 10.1.0.5/32 ethernet 2 10.1.0.5</code> is technically identical to <code>ip route 10.1.0.5/32 ethernet 2</code>, thus there is no reason to expect it to work differently. ;-) )</p>
