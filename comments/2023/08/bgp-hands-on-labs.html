            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Ivan,</p>

<p>I still have my ABCT course notes folder from around &#39;97-98 when I took the course that at the time was presented by Kevin Swannell from MTS. Looking at the first page, I had handwritten the following:</p>

<p><em>&quot;ABCT is written by Ivan Pepelnjak (www.nil.com - ip@nil.si)&quot;</em></p>

<p>This is the course agenda from that first page:</p>

<p><strong>Day 1</strong>
- BGP basics
- Simple BGP setup
- Multihomed leaf AS</p>

<p><strong>Day 2</strong>
- Configuring transit AS
- Managing large number of BGP neighbors</p>

<p><strong>Day 3</strong>
- Advanced BGP topics
- Wrap-up</p>

<p>The advanced BGP topics are further broken down as follows:
- Local preference
- MED
- Communities</p>

<p>There are also the following sections that are part of the course notes, but not listed in the contents above&quot;
- Advanced aggregation
- Lab exercises
- Lab solutions</p>

<p>Let me know if you want any more detail - I have the whole course notes, so I can easily send you photos/scans of any of it.</p>
