Looking at the first page, I had handwritten the following:</p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;ABCT is written by Ivan Pepelnjak (www.nil.com - ip@nil.si)&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>This is the course agenda from that first page:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Day 1</strong>\n- BGP basics\n- Simple BGP setup\n- Multihomed leaf AS</p>\n\n<p><strong>Day 2</strong>\n- Configuring transit AS\n- Managing large number of BGP neighbors</p>\n\n<p><strong>Day 3</strong>\n- Advanced BGP topics\n- Wrap-up</p>\n\n<p>The advanced BGP topics are further broken down as follows:\n- Local preference\n- MED\n- Communities</p>\n\n<p>There are also the following sections that are part of the course notes, but not listed in the contents above&quot;\n- Advanced aggregation\n- Lab exercises\n- Lab solutions</p>\n\n<p>Let me know if you want any more detail - I have the whole course notes, so I can easily send you photos/scans of any of it.</p>\n\n<p>Rob</p>\n",
