            <div class="comment-content"><p>All I would like to say Ivan is &quot; Thank You very much &quot; for your materials and efforts over the years. You took a very different approach for educating people as compared to becoming just another popular vendor training house.</p>

<p>I am sure many engineers will always have this in their mind including myself that You played a crucial role in their career success as Network Engineer.</p>
