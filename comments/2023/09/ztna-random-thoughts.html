            <div class="comment-content"><p>I can give you an old example... :-)</p>

<p>Novell NCP originally trusted that after the initial authentication, whatever is in the header of the subsequent NCP packets can be trusted.</p>

<p>Then there were some hacks, and they introduced digital signatures into NCP.
This way they got ZTA. Just the marketing term was not invented yet.</p>

<p>They had a nice directory service behind all of their services that supported those preparation steps.</p>

<p>So Novell had this already decades ago... :-)</p>

<p>However, what I see now that vendor presentations describe such overly complicated architectures that would cause more trouble than benefits.</p>

<p>So as usual, use your own common sense judgement and make a cost-benefit analysis.</p>

<p>And of course, technology is useless without proper processes executed correctly by educated and well motivated people. The weakest link, as always, is still the uncaring employee...</p>
