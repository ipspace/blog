            <div class="comment-content"><p>I once heard someone talking about SMTP say &quot;I really wish they would have called it &#39;Return Address&#39; and not &#39;From&#39; because this might help relate it to postal services where you can put whatever return address you want on an envelope and drop it off anywhere. It&#39;s not telling you where a piece of mail came from, it&#39;s telling you how to reply and the two may not be related&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m paraphrasing of course, but I think the same analogy can be made about IP to a large extent. IP Networks can/should add in things like urpf or bcp38, but they typically don&#39;t come with that out of the box because IP makes very little assumptions about the topology of the network. It&#39;s up to the operator to design that and implement spoofing protection (which is why it often does not get done).</p>

<p>Of course the analogy breaks down at some point, but it&#39;s a nice way to stop assuming src address is where the thing actually came from if you want to think about security</p>

            <div class="comment-content"><p>SMTP has the &quot;return address&quot; -- it&#39;s called &quot;reply-to:&quot;</p>

<p>As for network operators enabling DDoS attacks by not implementing BCP38, I totally agree with you.</p>
