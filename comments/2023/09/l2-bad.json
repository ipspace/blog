Of course it won&#39;t happen due to massive conflict of interest between vendors and customers. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Fewer features means fewer places where problems can occur.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>This is a cold, hard fact, not even an opinion. The more parts (physical or otherwise), the bigger the probability of something failing at some point, let alone a failure that results from interaction of features, which is exponentially harder to troubleshoot.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve been running EVPN with MLAG some 2 yrs now. Already there&#39;re cryptic errors happening no one knows why. In one case, it manifests in printers unable to email big scan jobs -- small ones go through fine. We tried lots of things, from the network to the Exchange Hub transport and mail servers. Some 8 months later, a colleague accidentally found out there seemed to be some problem with one of the MLAG links. Rebooting the switch having that MLAG fixed the problem. Still, no one knows why it manifested in that manner. And this is just one example. Feature-creep is just bad. Stick to the basics. KISS.</p>\n",
