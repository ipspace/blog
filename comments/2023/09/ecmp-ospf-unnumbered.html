            <div class="comment-content"><p>We are running OSPF for VXLAN underlay on IOS-XE platform (Cat 9k) and I was looking to get rid of unnumbered L3 EtherChannel interfaces between the switches and migrate to ECMP over unnumbered interfaces. While I was able to bring up OSPF adjacency over parallel unnumbered links, I could not bring up connectivity in such setup. Tried with both OSPF and OSPFv3 and the solution for me was: &#39;ip unnumbered Loopback0 poll point-to-point&#39;. </p>
