         "html": "<p>I think another reason for the &quot;Nothing Works&quot; world is that the only true Management Plane separation that exists in our industry is that of the real &quot;human&quot; management. In the medium/large enterprises they (and their interests, KPIs and so on) are very much separated from the technical workforce. And increasingly so, because today the technical workforce might not even be the employees of the same enterprise. They are likely to come from some IT consultancy outsource - degree of separation which makes a true SDN evangelist envy. </p>\n\n<p>So take an example. You - as a private person - buy a piece of consumer goods. Doesn&#39;t really matter what it is and what fruit appears on its back. What matters is that you are the end-user of it. And if using it causes a lot of pain, this will be <em>your</em> pain. So there is at least a tiny chance that you will rethink your choice next time and maybe try looking around or waiting for improvements. \nBut if you are that manager who decided to purchase a product XYZ for your enterprise, the pain of trying to make it work will not be <em>your</em> pain, it will be the pain of that technical workforce, about whose suffering - frankly - you couldn&#39;t care less. As long as you can report the right PPT bullets (and KPIs) all the way upstream inside your enterprise organization.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, if things go <em>really</em> wrong - hours of outage again and again, stuff doesn&#39;t work <em>at all</em>, that kind of things - then the vendor XYZ will eventually be in trouble. Although usually they still can get away with it using one of the standard solutions (&quot;Your technical guys did it all wrong, here is a free technical training for you to avoid this in the future!&quot;, &quot;Yes, but we have this case described in the list of known issues&quot;, &quot;We are sorry, here is a discount that will make it easier for you to reach your cost savings KPIs next quarter&quot; and so on). \nBut most ugly designs can still somehow work with the right amount of static routes and manual interventions, and who cares if the eyes of some &quot;unreasonable employees&quot; bleed while doing this =)</p>\n",
