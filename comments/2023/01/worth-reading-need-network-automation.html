            <div class="comment-content"><p>Funny timing. Was thinking about it just earlier today, and came to conclusion that network automation in the sense of writing tools / playbooks to do it is a niche thing and is IMO unlikely to ever become mainstream.</p>

<p>There are and will always be pockets of success, but I don&#39;t think it will ever reach the scale of say CCIE program. Not saying there&#39;s no benefit to it. Just that the scale of these benefits and the costs of getting them are very unequally distributed. </p>

<p>Can&#39;t say I can point to specific reasons, it&#39;s more of a result of an observation of what&#39;s been happening over time.</p>
