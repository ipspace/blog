         "html": "<p>&quot;I&rsquo;ve...seen too many outages caused by either human error or faulty automation.&quot;  I.e., I&#39;ve seen outages caused when stuff gets changed, regardless of whether it&#39;s by humans or machines.</p>\n\n<p>OK, but his point about automation is a good one.  The problem is often (as in the Amazon case) runaway automation, i.e., the provisioning system starts doing things other than expected, to devices other than expected, and operators cannot figure out how to stop it.  This is a serious problem--runaway automation is what brought down the 737-MAX, twice.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;...conference talks explaining how easy it is to automate your network...&quot;  Errr, guilty as charged.  I work in technical marketing, though :)  I think a lot of us who have done that are just trying to get people going using Python/Ansible/whatever, so that they understand what they can actually do with these tools.  I often end my talks telling people to start writing code, even if it&#39;s bad code.  Well, this isn&#39;t going to create software engineers with rigorous coding and testing processes.  I think the hope is that our audiences will realize the possibilities and then spend the time to develop the needed discipline.  And you&#39;re absolutely right, operational data is the best way to start because it is harmless.  Part of the problem is just the limitation of time--in a 90 minute Cisco Live session, I spend most of it explaining YANG/NETCONF to people who don&#39;t understand it.  If I spent a lot of time discussing coding practices I wouldn&#39;t be delivering the platform/OS-specific information I&#39;m expected to deliver.</p>\n\n<p>The other major problem with automation systems is that network engineers are used to working in a configuration-verify cycle.  Configure the BGP peer, then see if it came up.  Oh, it didn&#39;t, add the update-source.  Now it&#39;s up, let&#39;s add a network statement.  Now let&#39;s go back and verify the network made it into the BGP table.  Now did it show up in the peer?  It didn&#39;t?  Etc., etc.,  Pushing bulk config with automation tools breaks this and makes network engineers nervous.  Theoretically if the config is tested and validated in advance (on your digital twin, right? :)) then it should be proven and tested, but things often work differently when pushed to a real network.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a lot to be done here--I do believe we need automation for networks given the challenges of scale, etc., these days.  But &quot;ad experimentum&quot; Python scripting of critical network components is not something to be taken lightly.</p>\n",
