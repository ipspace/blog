And Golang absolutely needs more jabs for its ridiculous violation of both Postel&#39;s law and the Principle of Least Surprise with its insane TCP_NODELAY defaults. While it&#39;s probably too late to un-ring that bell, the situation sure smells like a similar bad call based on somebody&#39;s narrow view on what constitutes a widespread problem.</p>\n",
