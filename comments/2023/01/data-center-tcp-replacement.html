            <div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Ivan,</p>

<p>Thank you for this article.</p>

<p>While &quot;expectation of in-order packet delivery&quot; was an eyebrow-raiser for me (it&#39;s literally the opposite!), the complaint that TCP has HoL blocking when unrelated messages are fired into a single socket was my signal to put this paper down and do something else.</p>

<p>I hope those fanning the hype on this topic can reorganize around reasonable criticisms and actual problems experienced by sensibly written applications.</p>

<p>Oh... And Golang absolutely needs more jabs for its ridiculous violation of both Postel&#39;s law and the Principle of Least Surprise with its insane TCP_NODELAY defaults. While it&#39;s probably too late to un-ring that bell, the situation sure smells like a similar bad call based on somebody&#39;s narrow view on what constitutes a widespread problem.</p>
