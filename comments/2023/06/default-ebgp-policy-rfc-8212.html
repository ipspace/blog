            <div class="comment-content"><p>If I was an ISP, I would not give too much faith in customer&#39;s ability to have their BGP routing policy right. As a serious ISP I would always deploy a minimal inbound BGP routing policy set (for transit and peering) for safety reasons. If you are fluent you would automate routing policies (prefix-lists) based on e. g. RIPE database or equivalent service. In my opinion the ISPs are also in charge even more so. <br />
From time to time there will be fat fingers where no RFC or routing policy will help.</p>
